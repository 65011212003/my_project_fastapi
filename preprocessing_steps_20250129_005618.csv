38138134,Isolation and Evaluation of <i>Streptomyces melanogenes</i> YBS22 with Potential Application for Biocontrol of Rice Blast Disease.,"Plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi pose a significant threat to agricultural production. This study reports on a strain YBS22 with broad-spectrum antifungal activity that was isolated and identified, and its active metabolites were purified and systematically studied. Based on a whole genome sequence analysis, the new strain YBS22 was identified as <i>Streptomyces melanogenes</i>. Furthermore, eight gene clusters were predicted in YBS22 that are responsible for the synthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites. These clusters have homologous sequences in the MIBiG database with a similarity of 100%. The antifungal effects of YBS22 and its crude extract were evaluated in vivo and vitro. Our findings revealed that treatment with the strain YBS22 and its crude extract significantly reduced the size of necrotic lesions caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> on rice leaves. Further analysis led to the isolation and purification of an active compound from the crude extract of the strain YBS22, identified as <i>N</i>-formylantimycin acid methyl ester, an analog of antimycin, characterized by NMR and MS analyses. Consistently, the active compound can significantly inhibit the germination and development of <i>M. oryzae</i> spores in a manner that is both dose- and time-dependent. As a result, we propose that the strain YBS22 could serve as a novel source for the development of biological agents aimed at controlling rice blast disease.","plant diseases caused by pathogenic

37648175,Enhancing defense against rice blast disease: Unveiling the role of leaf endophytic firmicutes in antifungal antibiosis and induced systemic resistance.,"Rice remains the primary staple for more than half of the world's population, yet its cultivation faces numerous challenges, including both biotic and abiotic stresses. One significant obstacle is the prevalence of rice blast disease, which substantially diminishes productivity and increases cultivation costs due to frequent fungicide applications. Consequently, the presence of fungicide residues in rice raises concerns about compliance with international maximum residue limits (MRLs). While host resistance has proven effective, it often remains vulnerable to new variants of the Magnaporthe oryzae pathogen. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore innovative management strategies that can complement or enhance existing methods. An unexplored avenue involves harnessing endophytic bacterial communities. To this end, the present study investigates the potential of eleven endophytic Bacillus spp. in suppressing Pyricularia oryzae, promoting plant growth, and eliciting a defense response through phyllobacterization. The results indicate that the secreted metabolome and volatilome of seven tested isolates demonstrate inhibitory effects against P.oryzae, ranging from a minimum of 40% to a maximum of 70%. Bacillus siamensis L34, B. amyloliquefaciens RA37, B. velezensis L12, and B. subtilis B18 produce antifungal antibiotics targeting P.oryzae. Additionally, B. subtilis S4 and B. subtilis S6 emerge as excellent inducers of systemic resistance against blast disease, as evidenced by elevated activity of biochemical defense enzymes such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and total phenol content. However, a balance between primary metabolic activity (e.g., chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, and photosynthetic rate) and defense activity is observed. Furthermore, specific endophytic Bacillus spp. significantly stimulates defense-related genes, including OsPAD4, OsFMO1, and OsEDS1. These findings underscore the multifaceted potential of endophytic Bacillus in managing blast disease through antibiosis and induced systemic resistance. In conclusion, this study highlights the promising role of endophytic Bacillus spp. as a viable option for blast disease management. Their ability to inhibit the pathogen and induce systemic resistance makes them a valuable addition to the existing strategies. However, it is crucial to consider the trade-off between primary metabolic activity and defense response when implementing these bacteria-based approaches.","rice remains the primary staple for more

37560615,Binding of stress-responsive OsWRKY proteins through WRKYGQK heptapeptide residue with the promoter region of two rice blast disease resistance genes <i>Pi2</i> and <i>Pi54</i> is important for development of blast resistance.,"Molecular docking was done to investigate the interactions between five differentially expressed rice WRKY proteins when challenged with the rice blast disease caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and drought stresses applied either individually or overlapped, with the promoter region of two blast resistance genes (<i>Pi2</i> and <i>Pi54</i>). Molecular docking was performed using the HDOCK server. Initially, the homology models for each of the five rice WRKY proteins were prepared using I-TASSER server, and then the secondary structure as well as the DNA-binding pockets were predicted using PSIPRED and BindUP servers, respectively. The molecular docking study revealed a differential binding pattern of the rice WRKYs with the two blast resistance genes. The WRKY proteins (OsWRKY88 and OsWRKY102), whose transcript levels decrease when drought and blast stresses are overlapped, interact with the two resistance genes mostly involving the residues of the zinc finger structure. On the other hand, the WRKY proteins (OsWRKY53-1 and OsWRKY113), whose transcript levels did not reduce significantly when challenged by drought and blast overlapped condition compared to individual treatment of blast, interact mostly involving the residues of the conserved WRKYGQK heptapeptide sequence. Interestingly, the protein OsWRKY74 whose transcript levels are unaffected in both individual and overlapped stresses, interacts with both the blast resistance genes involving few residues of both WRKYGQK heptapeptide and the zinc finger structure. The findings thus indicate that the interaction of OsWRKY proteins involving the conserved WRKYGQK heptapeptide sequence with the blast resistance genes <i>Pi2</i> and <i>Pi54</i> is important to

37239859,"Isolation of <i>Bacillus siamensis</i> B-612, a Strain That Is Resistant to Rice Blast Disease and an Investigation of the Mechanisms Responsible for Suppressing Rice Blast Fungus.","Rice yield can be significantly impacted by rice blast disease. In this investigation, an endophytic strain of <i>Bacillus siamensis</i> that exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the growth of rice blast was isolated from healthy cauliflower leaves. 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis showed that it belongs to the genus <i>Bacillus siamensis</i>. Using the rice <i>OsActin</i> gene as an internal control, we analyzed the expression levels of genes related to the defense response of rice. Analysis showed that the expression levels of genes related to the defense response in rice were significantly upregulated 48 h after treatment. In addition, peroxidase (POD) activity gradually increased after treatment with B-612 fermentation solution and peaked 48 h after inoculation. These findings clearly demonstrated that the 1-butanol crude extract of B-612 retarded and inhibited conidial germination as well as the development of appressorium. The results of field experiments showed that treatment with B-612 fermentation solution and B-612 bacterial solution significantly reduced the severity of the disease before the seedling stage of Lijiangxintuan (LTH) was infected with rice blast. Future studies will focus on exploring whether <i>Bacillus siamensis</i> B-612 produces new lipopeptides and will apply proteomic and transcriptomic approaches to investigate the signaling pathways involved in its antimicrobial effects.","rice yield can be significantly impacted by rice blast disease. in this investigation, an endophytic strain of <i>bacillus siamensis</i> that exhibited a

37010277,Visualizing Early Infection Sites of Rice Blast Disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) on Barley (Hordeum vulgare) Using a Basic Microscope and a Smartphone.,"Understanding how plants and pathogens interact, and whether that interaction culminates in defense or disease, is required to develop stronger and more sustainable strategies for plant health. Advances in methods that more effectively image plant-pathogen samples during infection and colonization have yielded tools such as the rice leaf sheath assay, which has been useful in monitoring infection and early colonization events between rice and the fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. This hemi-biotrophic pathogen causes severe disease loss in rice and related monocots, including millet, rye, barley, and more recently, wheat. The leaf sheath assay, when performed correctly, yields an optically clear plant section, several layers thick, which allows researchers to perform live-cell imaging during pathogen attack or generate fixed samples stained for specific features. Detailed cellular investigations into the barley-M. oryzae interaction have lagged behind those of the rice host, in spite of the growing importance of this grain as a food source for animals and humans and as fermented beverages. Reported here is the development of a barley leaf sheath assay for intricate studies of M. oryzae interactions during the first 48 h post-inoculation. The leaf sheath assay, regardless of which species is being studied, is delicate; provided is a protocol that covers everything, from barley growth conditions and obtaining a leaf sheath, to inoculation, incubation, and imaging of the pathogen on plant leaves. This protocol can be optimized for high-throughput screening using something as simple as a smartphone for imaging purposes.","understanding how plants and pathogens interact, and whether that
