34769087,Recent Progress in Rice Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance.,"Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. However, stable rice production is constrained by various diseases, in particular rice blast, sheath blight, bacterial blight, and virus diseases. Breeding and cultivation of resistant rice varieties is the most effective method to control the infection of pathogens. Exploitation and utilization of the genetic determinants of broad-spectrum resistance represent a desired way to improve the resistance of susceptible rice varieties. Recently, researchers have focused on the identification of rice broad-spectrum disease resistance genes, which include <i>R</i> genes, defense-regulator genes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) against two or more pathogen species or many isolates of the same pathogen species. The cloning of broad-spectrum disease resistance genes and understanding their underlying mechanisms not only provide new genetic resources for breeding broad-spectrum rice varieties, but also promote the development of new disease resistance breeding strategies, such as editing susceptibility and executor <i>R</i> genes. In this review, the most recent advances in the identification of broad-spectrum disease resistance genes in rice and their application in crop improvement through biotechnology approaches during the past 10 years are summarized.",rice one important food crop world however stable rice production constrained various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance represent desired way improve resistance susceptible rice variety recently researcher focused identification rice broadspectrum disease resistance gene include iri gene defenseregulator gene quantitative trait locus qtl two pathogen specie many isolates pathogen specie cloning broadspectrum disease resistance gene understanding underlying mechanism provide new genetic resource breeding broadspectrum rice variety also promote development new disease resistance breeding strategy editing susceptibility executor iri gene review recent advance identification broadspectrum disease resistance gene rice application crop improvement biotechnology approach past year summarized,3,"{'Disease': ['various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance', 'resistance susceptible rice variety recently researcher focused identification rice broadspectrum disease resistance gene', 'broadspectrum disease resistance gene'], 'Treatment': ['various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance'], 'Symptom': ['various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance']}",4
38580607,Effectors and environment modulating rice blast disease: from understanding to effective control.,"Rice blast is a highly destructive crop disease that requires the interplay of three essential factors: the virulent blast fungus, the susceptible rice plant, and favorable environmental conditions. Although previous studies have focused mainly on the pathogen and rice, recent research has shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which the blast fungus and environmental conditions regulate host resistance and contribute to blast disease outbreaks. This review summarizes significant achievements in understanding the sophisticated modulation of blast resistance by Magnaporthe oryzae effectors and the dual regulatory mechanisms by which environmental conditions influence rice resistance and virulence of the blast fungus.

39180629,Allelic variation in rice blast resistance: a pathway to sustainable disease management.,"Rice blast is a major problem in agriculture, affecting rice production and threatening food security worldwide. This disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, has led to a lot of research since the discovery of the first resistance gene, pib, in 1999. Researchers have now identified more than 50 resistance genes on eight of the twelve chromosomes in rice, each targeting different strains of the pathogen.These genes are spread out across seventeen different loci. These genes, which primarily code for nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins, play an important part in the defense of rice against the pathogen, either alone or in combination with other genes. An important characteristic of these genes is the allelic or paralogous interactions that exist within these loci. These relationships contribute to the gene's increased capacity for evolutionary adaptation. The ability of resistance proteins to recognize and react to novel effectors is improved by the frequent occurrence of variations within the domains that are responsible for recognizing pathogen effectors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the progress that has been made in identifying these essential genes and to investigate the possibility of utilizing the allelic variants obtained from these genes in future rice breeding efforts to increase resistance to rice blast.",rice blast major problem agriculture affecting rice production threatening food security worldwide disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae led lot research since discovery first resistance gene pib researcher identified resistance gene eight twelve chromosome rice targeting different strain pathogenthese gene spread across seventeen different locus gene primarily code nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat protein play important part defense rice pathogen either alone combination gene important characteristic gene allelic paralogous interaction exist within locus relationship contribute gene increased capacity evolutionary adaptation ability resistance protein recognize react novel effector improved frequent occurrence variation within domain responsible recognizing pathogen effector purpose review summarize progress made identifying essential gene investigate possibility utilizing allelic variant obtained gene future rice breeding effort increase resistance rice blast,4,"{'Disease': ['food security worldwide disease', 'fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['react novel effector', 'domain responsible recognizing pathogen effector purpose review']}",4
23184051,Blast resistance in rice: a review of conventional breeding to molecular approaches.,"Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is the most severe diseases of rice. Using classical plant breeding techniques, breeders have developed a number of blast resistant cultivars adapted to different rice growing regions worldwide. However, the rice industry remains threatened by blast disease due to the instability of blast fungus. Recent advances in rice genomics provide additional tools for plant breeders to improve rice production systems that would be environmentally friendly. This article outlines the application of conventional breeding, tissue culture and DNA-based markers that are used for accelerating the development of blast resistant rice cultivars. The best way for controlling the disease is to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative genes in resistant variety. Through conventional and molecular breeding many blast-resistant varieties have been developed. Conventional breeding for disease resistance is tedious, time consuming and mostly dependent on environment as compare to molecular breeding particularly marker assisted selection, which is easier, highly efficient and precise. For effective management of blast disease, breeding work should be focused on utilizing the broad spectrum of resistance genes and pyramiding genes and quantitative trait loci. Marker assisted selection provides potential solution to some of the problems that conventional breeding cannot resolve. In recent years, blast resistant genes have introgressed into Luhui 17, G46B, Zhenshan 97B, Jin 23B, CO39, IR50, Pusa1602 and Pusa1603 lines through marker assisted selection. Introduction of exotic genes for resistance induced the occurrence of new races of blast fungus, therefore breeding work should be concentrated in local resistance genes.

39460780,Exploring the molecular mechanisms of rice blast resistance and advances in breeding for disease tolerance.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae), is a major problem in rice cultivation and ranks among the most severe fungal diseases. Cloning and identifying resistance genes in rice, coupled with a comprehensive examination of the interaction between M. oryzae and rice, may provide insights into the mechanisms of rice disease resistance and facilitate the creation of new rice varieties with improved germplasm. These efforts are essential for protecting food security. This review examines the discovery of genes that confer resistance or susceptiblity to M. oryzae in rice over the last decade. It also discusses how knowledge of molecular mechanisms has been used in rice breeding and outlines key strategies for creating rice varieties resistant to this disease. The strategies discussed include gene pyramiding, molecular design breeding, editing susceptibility genes, and increasing expression of resistance genes through pathogen challenge. We address the prospects and challenges in breeding for rice blast resistance, emphasizing the need to fully exploit germplasm resources, employ cutting-edge methods to identify new resistance genes, and develop innovative breeding cultivars.

34570416,Tangeretin inhibits fungal ferroptosis to suppress rice blast.,"Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary metabolites that function as signaling molecules, allopathic compounds, phytoalexins, detoxifying agents and antimicrobial defensive compounds in plants. Blast caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a serious disease affecting rice cultivation. In this study, we revealed that a natural flavonoid, tangeretin, substantially delays the formation of M. oryzae appressoria and blocks the development of blast lesions on rice plants. Our data suggest that tangeretin has antioxidant activity that interferes with conidial cell death/ferroptosis, which is critical for M. oryzae pathogenicity. Tangeretin showed a ferroptosis inhibition efficacy comparable to the well-established liproxstatin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of the NADPH oxidases NOX1 or NOX2 significantly decreased sensitivity toward tangeretin treatment, suggesting Nox-mediated lipid peroxidation as a possible target for tangeretin in regulating redox signaling and ferroptosis in M. oryzae. Our nursery and field tests showed that application of tangeretin can effectively mitigate overall disease symptoms and prevent leaf blast. Our study reveals the plant-derived fungal ferroptosis inhibitor tangeretin as a potential and novel antifungal agrochemical for the sustainable prevention of the devastating blast disease in important cereal crops.",flavonoid polyphenolic secondary metabolite function signaling molecule allopathic compound phytoalexins detoxifying agent antimicrobial defensive compound plant blast caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae serious disease affecting rice cultivation study revealed natural flavonoid tangeretin substantially delay formation oryzae appressoria block development blast lesion rice plant data suggest tangeretin antioxidant activity interferes conidial cell deathferroptosis critical oryzae pathogenicity tangeretin showed ferroptosis inhibition efficacy comparable wellestablished liproxstatin furthermore overexpression nadph oxidase nox nox significantly decreased sensitivity toward tangeretin treatment suggesting noxmediated lipid peroxidation possible target tangeretin regulating redox signaling ferroptosis oryzae nursery field test showed application tangeretin effectively mitigate overall disease symptom prevent leaf blast study reveals plantderived fungal ferroptosis inhibitor tangeretin potential novel antifungal agrochemical sustainable prevention devastating blast disease important cereal crop,1,"{'Disease': ['fungus magnaporthe oryzae serious disease', 'fungal ferroptosis inhibitor tangeretin potential novel antifungal agrochemical sustainable prevention devastating blast disease important cereal crop'], 'Treatment': ['tangeretin treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",1
39404763,Phytochrome B promotes blast disease resistance and enhances yield in rice.,"Phytochromes are red/far-red light receptors that regulate various aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. The precise mechanism by which phytochrome B (PhyB)-mediated light signaling influences plant defense and development remains unclear. In this study, we showed that PhyB enhances rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease resistance, tillering, and grain size compared to wild-type plants. Notably, PhyB interacted with and degraded grassy tiller 1 (GT1), a negative regulator of tiller development. Knockdown of GT1 in a phyB background partially rescued the diminished tillering of phyB. However, GT1 negatively regulates rice resistance to blast, suggesting that PhyB degradation of GT1 promotes tillering but not blast resistance. Previously, PhyB was found to interact with and degrade phytochrome-interacting factor 15 (PIL15), a key regulator of seed development that reduces rice resistance to blast and seed size. pil15 mutation in phyB mutants rescued phyB seed size and blast resistance, suggesting that PhyB might interact with and degrade PIL15 to negatively regulate blast resistance and seed size. PIL15 directly activated sugar will be eventually exported transporter 2a (SWEET2a). sweet2a mutants were less susceptible to blast disease compared to wild type. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PhyB promotes rice yield and blast resistance by inhibiting the transcription factors GT1 and PIL15 and downstream signaling.",phytochromes redfarred light receptor regulate various aspect plant growth development stress response precise mechanism phytochrome b phybmediated light signaling influence plant defense development remains unclear study showed phyb enhances rice oryza sativa blast disease resistance tillering grain size compared wildtype plant notably phyb interacted degraded grassy tiller gt negative regulator tiller development knockdown gt phyb background partially rescued diminished tillering phyb however gt negatively regulates rice resistance blast suggesting phyb degradation gt promotes tillering blast resistance previously phyb found interact degrade phytochromeinteracting factor pil key regulator seed development reduces rice resistance blast seed size pil mutation phyb mutant rescued phyb seed size blast resistance suggesting phyb might interact degrade pil negatively regulate blast resistance seed size pil directly activated sugar eventually exported transporter sweeta sweeta mutant less susceptible blast disease compared wild type collectively data demonstrate phyb promotes rice yield blast resistance inhibiting transcription factor gt pil downstream signaling,0,"{'Disease': ['rice oryza sativa blast disease resistance tillering grain size', 'eventually exported transporter sweeta sweeta mutant less susceptible blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
34890109,Engineering of rice varieties with enhanced resistances to both blast and bacterial blight diseases via CRISPR/Cas9.,"Rice blast and bacterial blight represent two of major diseases having devastating impact on the yield of rice in most rice-growing countries. Developments of resistant cultivars are the most economic and effective strategy to control these diseases. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to rapidly install mutations in three known broad-spectrum blast-resistant genes, Bsr-d1, Pi21 and ERF922, in an indica thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) rice line Longke638S (LK638S). We obtained transgene-free homozygous single or triple mutants in T<sub>1</sub> generations. While all single and triple mutants showed increased resistance to rice blast compared with wild type, the erf922 mutants displayed the strongest blast resistance similar with triple mutants. Surprisingly, we found that Pi21 or ERF922 single mutants conferred enhanced resistance to most of tested bacterial blight. Both resistances in mutants were attribute to the up-regulation of SA- and JA-pathway associated genes. Moreover, phenotypic analysis of these single mutants in paddy fields revealed that there were no trade-offs between resistances and main agricultural traits. Together, our study provides a rapid and effective way to generate rice varieties with resistance to both rice blast and bacterial blight.",rice blast bacterial blight represent two major disease devastating impact yield rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease used crisprcasmediated gene editing rapidly install mutation three known broadspectrum blastresistant gene bsrd pi erf indica thermosensitive genic male sterile tgms rice line longkes lks obtained transgenefree homozygous single triple mutant tsubsub generation single triple mutant showed increased resistance rice blast compared wild type erf mutant displayed strongest blast resistance similar triple mutant surprisingly found pi erf single mutant conferred enhanced resistance tested bacterial blight resistance mutant attribute upregulation sa japathway associated gene moreover phenotypic analysis single mutant paddy field revealed tradeoff resistance main agricultural trait together study provides rapid effective way generate rice variety resistance rice blast bacterial blight,3,"{'Disease': ['two major disease devastating impact yield rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['two major disease devastating impact yield rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease', 'rapid effective way']}",4
36511124,An OsPRMT5-OsAGO2/miR1875-OsHXK1 module regulates rice immunity to blast disease.,"Rice ARGONAUTE2 (OsAGO2) is a core component of the rice RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is repressed by Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) infection. Whether and how OsAGO2-mediated gene silencing plays a role in rice blast resistance and which sRNAs participate in this process are unknown. Our results indicate that OsAGO2 is a key immune player that manipulates rice defense responses against blast disease. OsAGO2 associates with the 24-nt miR1875 and binds to the promoter region of HEXOKINASE1 (OsHXK1), which causes DNA methylation and leads to gene silencing. Our multiple genetic evidence showed that, without M. oryzae infection, OsAGO2/miR1875 RISC promoted OsHXK1 promoter DNA methylation and OsHXK1 silencing; after M. oryzae infection, the reduced OsAGO2/miR1875 led to a relatively activated OsHXK1 expression. OsHXK1 acts as a positive regulator of blast disease resistance that OsHXK1-OE rice exhibited enhanced resistance, whereas Cas9-Oshxk1 rice showed reduced resistance against M. oryzae infection. OsHXK1 may function through its sugar sensor activity as glucose induced defense-related gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in Nipponbare and OsHXK1-OE but not in Cas9-Oshxk1 rice. OsAGO2 itself is delicately regulated by OsPRMT5, which senses M. oryzae infection and attenuates OsAGO2-mediated gene silencing through OsAGO2 arginine methylation.

38729111,The phosphorylation landscape of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus.,"Many of the world's most devastating crop diseases are caused by fungal pathogens that elaborate specialized infection structures to invade plant tissue. Here, we present a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which threatens global food security. We mapped 8,005 phosphosites on 2,062 fungal proteins following germination on a hydrophobic surface, revealing major re-wiring of phosphorylation-based signaling cascades during appressorium development. Comparing phosphosite conservation across 41 fungal species reveals phosphorylation signatures specifically associated with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infection. We then used parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to identify phosphoproteins regulated by the fungal Pmk1 MAPK that controls plant infection by M. oryzae. We define 32 substrates of Pmk1 and show that Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of regulator Vts1 is required for rice blast disease. Defining the phosphorylation landscape of infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic interventions for the control of plant diseases.",many world devastating crop disease caused fungal pathogen elaborate specialized infection structure invade plant tissue present quantitative massspectrometrybased phosphoproteomic analysis infectionrelated development rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae threatens global food security mapped phosphosites fungal protein following germination hydrophobic surface revealing major rewiring phosphorylationbased signaling cascade appressorium development comparing phosphosite conservation across fungal specie reveals phosphorylation signature specifically associated biotrophic hemibiotrophic fungal infection used parallel reaction monitoring prm identify phosphoprotein regulated fungal pmk mapk control plant infection oryzae define substrate pmk show pmkdependent phosphorylation regulator vt required rice blast disease defining phosphorylation landscape infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic intervention control plant disease,1,"{'Disease': ['many world devastating crop disease', 'development rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'rice blast disease defining phosphorylation landscape infection', 'potential therapeutic intervention control plant disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

Evaluation of genetic and virulence diversity of blast populations with diagnostic markers will aid disease management. We review the M. oryzae species-specific and cultivar-specific avirulence determinants and evaluate efforts towards generating durable and broad-spectrum resistance in single resistant cultivars or mixtures.

38953747,A NAC transcription factor MNAC3-centered regulatory network negatively modulates rice immunity against blast disease.,"NAC transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal in plant immunity against diverse pathogens. Here, we report the functional and regulatory network of MNAC3, a novel NAC TF, in rice immunity. MNAC3, a transcriptional activator, negatively modulates rice immunity against blast and bacterial leaf blight diseases and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immune responses. MNAC3 binds to a CACG cis-element and activates the transcription of immune-negative target genes OsINO80, OsJAZ10, and OsJAZ11. The negative function of MNAC3 in rice immunity depends on its transcription of downstream genes such as OsINO80 and OsJAZ10. MNAC3 interacts with immunity-related OsPP2C41 (a protein phosphatase), ONAC066 (a NAC TF), and OsDjA6 (a DnaJ chaperone). ONAC066 and OsPP2C41 attenuate MNAC3 transcriptional activity, while OsDjA6 promotes it. Phosphorylation of MNAC3 at S163 is critical for its negative functions in rice immunity. OsPP2C41, which plays positive roles in rice blast resistance and chitin-triggered immune responses, dephosphorylates MNAC3, suppressing its transcriptional activity on the target genes OsINO80, OsJAZ10, and OsJAZ11 and promoting the translocation of MNAC3 from nucleus to cytoplasm. These results establish a MNAC3-centered regulatory network in which OsPP2C41 dephosphorylates MNAC3, attenuating its transcriptional activity on downstream immune-negative target genes in rice. Together, these findings deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms in rice immunity and offer a novel strategy for genetic improvement of rice disease resistance.",nac transcription factor tfs pivotal plant immunity diverse pathogen report functional regulatory network mnac novel nac tf rice immunity mnac transcriptional activator negatively modulates rice immunity blast bacterial leaf blight disease pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamptriggered immune response mnac bind cacg ciselement activates transcription immunenegative target gene osino osjaz osjaz negative function mnac rice immunity depends transcription downstream gene osino osjaz mnac interacts immunityrelated osppc protein phosphatase onac nac tf osdja dnaj chaperone onac osppc attenuate mnac transcriptional activity osdja promotes phosphorylation mnac critical negative function rice immunity osppc play positive role rice blast resistance chitintriggered immune response dephosphorylates mnac suppressing transcriptional activity target gene osino osjaz osjaz promoting translocation mnac nucleus cytoplasm result establish mnaccentered regulatory network osppc dephosphorylates mnac attenuating transcriptional activity downstream immunenegative target gene rice together finding deepen understanding molecular mechanism rice immunity offer novel strategy genetic improvement rice disease resistance,4,"{'Disease': ['rice immunity blast bacterial leaf blight disease', 'novel strategy genetic improvement rice disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
25394538,Molecular progress on the mapping and cloning of functional genes for blast disease in rice (Oryza sativa L.): current status and future considerations.,"Rice blast disease, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is a recurring problem in all rice-growing regions of the world. The use of resistance (R) genes in rice improvement breeding programmes has been considered to be one of the best options for crop protection and blast management. Alternatively, quantitative resistance conferred by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is also a valuable resource for the improvement of rice disease resistance. In the past, intensive efforts have been made to identify major R-genes as well as QTLs for blast disease using molecular techniques. A review of bibliographic references shows over 100 blast resistance genes and a larger number of QTLs (∼500) that were mapped to the rice genome. Of the blast resistance genes, identified in different genotypes of rice, ∼22 have been cloned and characterized at the molecular level. In this review, we have summarized the reported rice blast resistance genes and QTLs for utilization in future molecular breeding programmes to introgress high-degree resistance or to pyramid R-genes in commercial cultivars that are susceptible to M. oryzae. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the significant studies in order to update our understanding of the molecular progress on rice and M. oryzae.

24240810,A review of microsatellite markers and their applications in rice breeding programs to improve blast disease resistance.,"Over the last few decades, the use of molecular markers has played an increasing role in rice breeding and genetics. Of the different types of molecular markers, microsatellites have been utilized most extensively, because they can be readily amplified by PCR and the large amount of allelic variation at each locus. Microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSR), and they are typically composed of 1-6 nucleotide repeats. These markers are abundant, distributed throughout the genome and are highly polymorphic compared with other genetic markers, as well as being species-specific and co-dominant. For these reasons, they have become increasingly important genetic markers in rice breeding programs. The evolution of new biotypes of pests and diseases as well as the pressures of climate change pose serious challenges to rice breeders, who would like to increase rice production by introducing resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Recent advances in rice genomics have now made it possible to identify and map a number of genes through linkage to existing DNA markers. Among the more noteworthy examples of genes that have been tightly linked to molecular markers in rice are those that confer resistance or tolerance to blast. Therefore, in combination with conventional breeding approaches, marker-assisted selection (MAS) can be used to monitor the presence or lack of these genes in breeding populations. For example, marker-assisted backcross breeding has been used to integrate important genes with significant biological effects into a number of commonly grown rice varieties. The use of cost-effective, finely mapped microsatellite markers and MAS strategies should provide opportunities for breeders to develop high-yield, blast resistance rice cultivars. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the linkage of microsatellite markers to rice blast resistance genes, as well as to explore the use of MAS in rice breeding programs aimed at improving blast resistance in this species. We also discuss the various advantages, disadvantages and uses of microsatellite markers relative to other molecular marker types.",last decade use molecular marker played increasing role rice breeding genetics different type molecular marker microsatellites utilized extensively readily amplified pcr large amount allelic variation locus microsatellites also known simple sequence repeat ssr typically composed nucleotide repeat marker abundant distributed throughout genome highly polymorphic compared genetic marker well speciesspecific codominant reason become increasingly important genetic marker rice breeding program evolution new biotype pest disease well pressure climate change pose serious challenge rice breeder would like increase rice production introducing resistance multiple biotic abiotic stress recent advance rice genomics made possible identify map number gene linkage existing dna marker among noteworthy example gene tightly linked molecular marker rice confer resistance tolerance blast therefore combination conventional breeding approach markerassisted selection ma used monitor presence lack gene breeding population example markerassisted backcross breeding used integrate important gene significant biological effect number commonly grown rice variety use costeffective finely mapped microsatellite marker ma strategy provide opportunity breeder develop highyield blast resistance rice cultivar aim review summarize current knowledge concerning linkage microsatellite marker rice blast resistance gene well explore use ma rice breeding program aimed improving blast resistance specie also discus various advantage disadvantage us microsatellite marker relative molecular marker type,4,"{'Disease': ['increasingly important genetic marker rice breeding program evolution new biotype pest disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['integrate important gene significant biological effect number', 'costeffective finely mapped microsatellite marker ma strategy']}",0
38553222,"Bio-formulated chitosan nanoparticles enhance disease resistance against rice blast by physiomorphic, transcriptional, and microbiome modulation of rice (Oryza sativa L.).","Rice blast disease (RBD) caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, threaten food security by cutting agricultural output. Nano agrochemicals are now perceived as sustainable, cost-effective alternatives to traditional pesticides. This study investigated bioformulation of moringa chitosan nanoparticles (M-CsNPs) and their mechanisms for suppressing RBD while minimizing toxic effects on the microenvironment. M-CsNPs, sized 46 nm with semi-spherical morphology, significantly suppressed pathogen growth, integrity, and colonization at 200 mg L<sup>-1</sup>in vitro. Greenhouse tests with foliar exposure to the same concentration resulted in a substantial 77.7 % reduction in RBD, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity and plant health. Furthermore, M-CsNPs improved photosynthesis, gas exchange, and the nutritional profile of diseased rice plants. RNA-seq analysis highlighted upregulated defense-related genes in treated rice plants. Metagenomic study showcased reshaping of the rice microbiome, reducing Magnaporthe abundance by 93.5 %.

In this investigation, an endophytic strain of <i>Bacillus siamensis</i> that exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the growth of rice blast was isolated from healthy cauliflower leaves. 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis showed that it belongs to the genus <i>Bacillus siamensis</i>. Using the rice <i>OsActin</i> gene as an internal control, we analyzed the expression levels of genes related to the defense response of rice. Analysis showed that the expression levels of genes related to the defense response in rice were significantly upregulated 48 h after treatment. In addition, peroxidase (POD) activity gradually increased after treatment with B-612 fermentation solution and peaked 48 h after inoculation. These findings clearly demonstrated that the 1-butanol crude extract of B-612 retarded and inhibited conidial germination as well as the development of appressorium. The results of field experiments showed that treatment with B-612 fermentation solution and B-612 bacterial solution significantly reduced the severity of the disease before the seedling stage of Lijiangxintuan (LTH) was infected with rice blast.

36897889,Phenotypic and Genotypic screening of fifty-two rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes for desirable cultivars against blast disease.,"Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus, is one of the most dangerous rice pathogens, causing considerable crop losses around the world. In order to explore the rice blast-resistant sources, initially performed a large-scale screening of 277 rice accessions. In parallel with field evaluations, fifty-two rice accessions were genotyped for 25 major blast resistance genes utilizing functional/gene-based markers based on their reactivity against rice blast disease. According to the phenotypic examination, 29 (58%) and 22 (42%) entries were found to be highly resistant, 18 (36%) and 29 (57%) showed moderate resistance, and 05 (6%) and 01 (1%), respectively, were highly susceptible to leaf and neck blast. The genetic frequency of 25 major blast resistance genes ranged from 32 to 60%, with two genotypes having a maximum of 16 R-genes each. The 52 rice accessions were divided into two groups based on cluster and population structure analysis. The highly resistant and moderately resistant accessions are divided into different groups using the principal coordinate analysis. According to the analysis of molecular variance, the maximum diversity was found within the population, while the minimum diversity was found between the populations. Two markers (RM5647 and K39512), which correspond to the blast-resistant genes Pi36 and Pik, respectively, showed a significant association to the neck blast disease, whereas three markers (Pi2-i, Pita3, and k2167), which correspond to the blast-resistant genes Pi2, Pita/Pita2, and Pikm, respectively, showed a significant association to the leaf blast disease.

31640541,Predicting rice blast disease: machine learning versus process-based models.,"In this study, we compared four models for predicting rice blast disease, two operational process-based models (Yoshino and Water Accounting Rice Model (WARM)) and two approaches based on machine learning algorithms (M5Rules and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)), the former inducing a rule-based model and the latter building a neural network. In situ telemetry is important to obtain quality in-field data for predictive models and this was a key aspect of the RICE-GUARD project on which this study is based. According to the authors, this is the first time process-based and machine learning modelling approaches for supporting plant disease management are compared. Results clearly showed that the models succeeded in providing a warning of rice blast onset and presence, thus representing suitable solutions for preventive remedial actions targeting the mitigation of yield losses and the reduction of fungicide use. All methods gave significant ""signals"" during the ""early warning"" period, with a similar level of performance. M5Rules and WARM gave the maximum average normalized scores of 0.80 and 0.77, respectively, whereas Yoshino gave the best score for one site (Kalochori 2015). The best average values of r and r<sup>2</sup> and %MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for the machine learning models were 0.70, 0.50 and 0.75, respectively and for the process-based models the corresponding values were 0.59, 0.40 and 0.82. Thus it has been found that the ML models are competitive with the process-based models. This result has relevant implications for the operational use of the models, since most of the available studies are limited to the analysis of the relationship between the model outputs and the incidence of rice blast. Results also showed that machine learning methods approximated the performances of two process-based models used for years in operational contexts. Process-based and data-driven models can be used to provide early warnings to anticipate rice blast and detect its presence, thus supporting fungicide applications. Data-driven models derived from machine learning methods are a viable alternative to process-based approaches and - in cases when training datasets are available - offer a potentially greater adaptability to new contexts.",study compared four model predicting rice blast disease two operational processbased model yoshino water accounting rice model warm two approach based machine learning algorithm mrules recurrent neural network rnn former inducing rulebased model latter building neural network situ telemetry important obtain quality infield data predictive model key aspect riceguard project study based according author first time processbased machine learning modelling approach supporting plant disease management compared result clearly showed model succeeded providing warning rice blast onset presence thus representing suitable solution preventive remedial action targeting mitigation yield loss reduction fungicide use method gave significant signal early warning period similar level performance mrules warm gave maximum average normalized score respectively whereas yoshino gave best score one site kalochori best average value r rsupsup mae mean absolute error machine learning model respectively processbased model corresponding value thus found ml model competitive processbased model result relevant implication operational use model since available study limited analysis relationship model output incidence rice blast result also showed machine learning method approximated performance two processbased model used year operational context processbased datadriven model used provide early warning anticipate rice blast detect presence thus supporting fungicide application datadriven model derived machine learning method viable alternative processbased approach case training datasets available offer potentially greater adaptability new context,4,"{'Disease': ['modelling approach supporting plant disease management'], 'Treatment': ['modelling approach supporting plant disease management', 'fungicide use method', 'machine learning method', 'fungicide application datadriven model derived machine learning method viable alternative processbased approach case training datasets'], 'Symptom': []}",3
38664971,"Recognition of the inducible, secretory small protein OsSSP1 by the membrane receptor OsSSR1 and the co-receptor OsBAK1 confers rice resistance to the blast fungus.","The plant apoplast, which serves as the frontline battleground for long-term host-pathogen interactions, harbors a wealth of disease resistance resources. However, the identification of the disease resistance proteins in the apoplast is relatively lacking. In this study, we identified and characterized the rice secretory protein OsSSP1 (Oryza sativa secretory small protein 1). OsSSP1 can be secreted into the plant apoplast, and either in vitro treatment of recombinant OsSSP1 or overexpression of OsSSP1 in rice could trigger plant immune response. The expression of OsSSP1 is suppressed significantly during Magnaporthe oryzae infection in the susceptible rice variety Taibei 309, and OsSSP1-overexpressing lines all show strong resistance to M. oryzae. Combining the knockout and overexpression results, we found that OsSSP1 positively regulates plant immunity in response to fungal infection. Moreover, the recognition and immune response triggered by OsSSP1 depend on an uncharacterized transmembrane OsSSR1 (secretory small protein receptor 1) and the key co-receptor OsBAK1, since most of the induced immune response and resistance are lost in the absence of OsSSR1 or OsBAK1. Intriguingly, the OsSSP1 protein is relatively stable and can still induce plant resistance after 1 week of storage in the open environment, and exogenous OsSSP1 treatment for a 2-week period did not affect rice yield. Collectively, our study reveals that OsSSP1 can be secreted into the apoplast and percepted by OsSSR1 and OsBAK1 during fungal infection, thereby triggering the immune response to enhance plant resistance to M. oryzae. These findings provide novel resources and potential strategies for crop breeding and disease control.",plant apoplast serf frontline battleground longterm hostpathogen interaction harbor wealth disease resistance resource however identification disease resistance protein apoplast relatively lacking study identified characterized rice secretory protein osssp oryza sativa secretory small protein osssp secreted plant apoplast either vitro treatment recombinant osssp overexpression osssp rice could trigger plant immune response expression osssp suppressed significantly magnaporthe oryzae infection susceptible rice variety taibei ossspoverexpressing line show strong resistance oryzae combining knockout overexpression result found osssp positively regulates plant immunity response fungal infection moreover recognition immune response triggered osssp depend uncharacterized transmembrane osssr secretory small protein receptor key coreceptor osbak since induced immune response resistance lost absence osssr osbak intriguingly osssp protein relatively stable still induce plant resistance week storage open environment exogenous osssp treatment week period affect rice yield collectively study reveals osssp secreted apoplast percepted osssr osbak fungal infection thereby triggering immune response enhance plant resistance oryzae finding provide novel resource potential strategy crop breeding disease control,4,"{'Disease': ['apoplast serf frontline battleground longterm hostpathogen interaction harbor wealth disease resistance resource', 'novel resource potential strategy crop breeding disease control'], 'Treatment': ['apoplast either vitro treatment recombinant osssp overexpression osssp rice', 'exogenous osssp treatment week period'], 'Symptom': []}",1
34482912,Antifungal activity of glyphosate against fungal blast disease on glyphosate-tolerant OsmEPSPS transgenic rice.,"Weeds, pests, and pathogens are among the pre-harvest constraints in rice farming across rice-growing countries. For weed management, manual weeding and herbicides are widely practiced. Among the herbicides, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is a broad-spectrum systemic chemical extensively used in agriculture. Being a competitive structural analog to phosphoenolpyruvate, it selectively inhibits the conserved 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme required for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and essential metabolites in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In the present study, we investigated the antifungal and defense elicitor activity of glyphosate against Magnaporthe oryzae on transgenic-rice overexpressing a glyphosate-resistance OsEPSPS gene (T173I + P177S; TIPS OsmEPSPS) for blast disease management. The glyphosate foliar spray on OsmEPSPS transgenic rice lines showed both prophylactic and curative suppression of blast disease comparable to a blasticide, tricyclazole. The glyphosate displayed direct antifungal activity on Magnaporthe oryzae as well as enhanced the levels of antioxidant enzymes and photosynthetic pigments in rice. However, the genes associated with phytohormones-mediated defense (OsPAD4, OsNPR1.3, and OsFMO) and innate immunity pathway (OsCEBiP and OsCERK1) were found repressed upon glyphosate spray. Altogether, the current study is the first report highlighting the overexpression of a crop-specific TIPS mutation in conjugation with glyphosate application showing potential for blast disease management in rice cultivation.",weed pest pathogen among preharvest constraint rice farming across ricegrowing country weed management manual weeding herbicide widely practiced among herbicide glyphosate nphosphonomethyl glycine broadspectrum systemic chemical extensively used agriculture competitive structural analog phosphoenolpyruvate selectively inhibits conserved enolpyruvylshikimatephosphate synthase epsps enzyme required biosynthesis aromatic amino acid essential metabolite eukaryote prokaryote present study investigated antifungal defense elicitor activity glyphosate magnaporthe oryzae transgenicrice overexpressing glyphosateresistance osepsps gene ti p tip osmepsps blast disease management glyphosate foliar spray osmepsps transgenic rice line showed prophylactic curative suppression blast disease comparable blasticide tricyclazole glyphosate displayed direct antifungal activity magnaporthe oryzae well enhanced level antioxidant enzyme photosynthetic pigment rice however gene associated phytohormonesmediated defense ospad osnpr osfmo innate immunity pathway oscebip oscerk found repressed upon glyphosate spray altogether current study first report highlighting overexpression cropspecific tip mutation conjugation glyphosate application showing potential blast disease management rice cultivation,3,"{'Disease': ['osmepsps blast disease management glyphosate foliar spray osmepsps transgenic rice line', 'prophylactic curative suppression blast disease', 'potential blast disease management rice cultivation'], 'Treatment': ['country weed management manual', 'osmepsps blast disease management glyphosate foliar spray osmepsps transgenic rice line', 'potential blast disease management rice cultivation'], 'Symptom': []}",3
39095388,Kosakonia oryziphila NP19 bacterium acts as a plant growth promoter and biopesticide to suppress blast disease in KDML105 rice.,"This study demonstrates that root-associated Kosakonia oryziphila NP19, isolated from rice roots, is a promising plant growth-promoting bioagent and biopesticide for combating rice blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae. In vitro experiments were conducted on fresh leaves of Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) jasmine rice seedlings. The results showed that NP19 effectively inhibited the germination of P. oryzae fungal conidia. Fungal infection was suppressed across three different treatment conditions: rice colonized with NP19 and inoculated by fungal conidia, a mix of NP19 and fungal conidia concurrently inoculated on the leaves, and fungal conidia inoculation first followed by NP19 inoculation after 30 h. Additionally, NP19 reduced fungal mycelial growth by 9.9-53.4%. In pot experiments, NP19 enhanced the activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 6.1-63.0% and 3.0-67.7%, respectively, indicating a boost in the plant's defense mechanisms. Compared to the uncolonized control, the NP19-colonized rice had 0.3-24.7% more pigment contents, 4.1% more filled grains per panicle, 26.3% greater filled grain yield, 34.4% higher harvest index, and 10.1% more content of the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP); for rice colonized with NP19 and infected with P. oryzae, these increases were 0.2-49.2%, 4.6%, 9.1%, 54.4%, and 7.5%, respectively. In field experiments, blast-infected rice that was colonized and/or inoculated with NP19 treatments had 15.1-27.2% more filled grains per panicle, 103.6-119.8% greater filled grain yield, and 18.0-35.8% higher 2AP content. A higher SOD activity (6.9-29.5%) was also observed in the above-mentioned rice than in the blast-infected rice that was not colonized and inoculated with NP19. Following blast infection, NP19 applied to leaves decreased blast lesion progression. Therefore, K. oryziphila NP19 was demonstrated to be a potential candidate for use as a plant growth-promoting bioagent and biopesticide for suppressing rice blast.",study demonstrates rootassociated kosakonia oryziphila np isolated rice root promising plant growthpromoting bioagent biopesticide combating rice blast caused pyricularia oryzae vitro experiment conducted fresh leaf khao dawk mali kdml jasmine rice seedling result showed np effectively inhibited germination p oryzae fungal conidium fungal infection suppressed across three different treatment condition rice colonized np inoculated fungal conidium mix np fungal conidium concurrently inoculated leaf fungal conidium inoculation first followed np inoculation h additionally np reduced fungal mycelial growth pot experiment np enhanced activity peroxidase pod superoxide dismutase sod respectively indicating boost plant defense mechanism compared uncolonized control npcolonized rice pigment content filled grain per panicle greater filled grain yield higher harvest index content aroma compound acetylpyrroline ap rice colonized np infected p oryzae increase respectively field experiment blastinfected rice colonized andor inoculated np treatment filled grain per panicle greater filled grain yield higher ap content higher sod activity also observed abovementioned rice blastinfected rice colonized inoculated np following blast infection np applied leaf decreased blast lesion progression therefore k oryziphila np demonstrated potential candidate use plant growthpromoting bioagent biopesticide suppressing rice blast,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['three different treatment condition rice', 'treatment'], 'Symptom': ['effectively inhibited germination p oryzae fungal conidium fungal infection']}",3
34058471,CBL-interacting protein kinase 31 regulates rice resistance to blast disease by modulating cellular potassium levels.,"Rice blast disease caused by infection with Magnaporthe oryzae, a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen, significantly reduces the yield production. However, the rice defense mechanism against blast disease remains elusive. To identify the genes involved in the regulation of rice defense to blast disease, dissociation (Ds) transposon tagging mutant lines were analyzed in terms of their response to M. oryzae isolate Guy11. Among them, CBL-interactingprotein kinase31 (CIPK31) mutants were more susceptible than wild-type plants to blast. The CIPK31 transcript was found to be insensitive to Guy11 infection, and the CIPK31-GFP was localized to the cytosol and nucleus. Overexpression of CIPK31 promoted rice defense to blast. Further analysis indicated that CIPK31 interacts with Calcineurin B-like 2 (CBL2) and CBL6 at the plasma membrane, and cbl2 mutants are more susceptible to blast compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that calcium signaling might partially through the CBL2-CIPK31 signaling regulate rice defense. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that AKT1-like (AKT1L), a potential potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel protein, interacted with CIPK31, and the K<sup>+</sup> level was significantly lower in the cipk31 mutants than in the wild-type control. In addition, exogenous potassium application increased rice resistance to blast, suggesting that CIPK31 might interact with AKT1L to increase K<sup>+</sup> uptake, thereby promoting resistance to blast. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that CBL2-CIPK31-AKT1L is a new signaling pathway that regulates rice defense to blast disease.",rice blast disease caused infection magnaporthe oryzae hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen significantly reduces yield production however rice defense mechanism blast disease remains elusive identify gene involved regulation rice defense blast disease dissociation d transposon tagging mutant line analyzed term response oryzae isolate guy among cblinteractingprotein kinase cipk mutant susceptible wildtype plant blast cipk transcript found insensitive guy infection cipkgfp localized cytosol nucleus overexpression cipk promoted rice defense blast analysis indicated cipk interacts calcineurin blike cbl cbl plasma membrane cbl mutant susceptible blast compared wildtype plant suggesting calcium signaling might partially cblcipk signaling regulate rice defense yeast twohybrid result showed aktlike aktl potential potassium ksupsup channel protein interacted cipk ksupsup level significantly lower cipk mutant wildtype control addition exogenous potassium application increased rice resistance blast suggesting cipk might interact aktl increase ksupsup uptake thereby promoting resistance blast taken together result presented demonstrate cblcipkaktl new signaling pathway regulates rice defense blast disease,1,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'rice defense mechanism blast disease', 'regulation rice defense blast disease dissociation', 'rice defense blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
33515498,Gamma-irradiated fenugreek extracts mediates resistance to rice blast disease through modulating histochemical and biochemical changes.,"The impact of gamma radiation on the activation of rice innate immunity to blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is described. In the present study, fenugreek seed extracts radiated with different doses of gamma rays viz. 5Gy, 10Gy, 15Gy, 20Gy and 25Gy were examined for their presence of biocompounds as well as for its ability to induce plant growth promotion and resistance against rice blast disease. The results of GC-MS analysis detected antimicrobial properties in methanolic extract. Enhanced germination (97%) and vigor (2718) was noticed in seeds pretreated with 20 Gy of gamma radiation in comparison with non-irradiated controls. Under greenhouse conditions, a significant disease protection of 56.7% on 3rd and 4th day after inoculation against rice blast was observed in 15Gy-irradiated rice plants challenge-inoculated with M. oryzae. Further, a significant increase in the hydrogen peroxide, phenol and lignin deposition was noticed in 20Gy-irradiated rice plants. Additionally, rice plants pretreated with 15Gy induced maximum activities of peroxidase (POX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) compared to untreated control plants.

35249642,Antifungal and defense elicitor activity of Potassium phosphite against fungal blast disease on ptxD-OE transgenic indica rice and its acceptor parent.,"In rice farming, the blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (T.T. Hebert) M.E. Barr. is one of the primary production constraints worldwide. The current blast management options such as blast-resistant varieties and spraying fungicides are neither durable nor commercially and environmentally compatible. In the present study, we investigated the antifungal and defense elicitor activity of potassium phosphite (Phi) against M. oryzae on elite rice cultivar BPT5204 (popularly known as Samba Mahsuri in India) and its transgenic rice variant (ptxD-OE) over-expressing a phosphite dehydrogenase enzyme. The Phi was evaluated both preventively and curatively on rice genotypes where the preventive spray of Phi outperformed the Phi curative application with significant reductions in both rice blast severity (35.67-60.49%) and incidence (22.27-53.25%). Moreover, the application of Phi increased the levels of photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll and Carotenoids) coupled with increased activity of defense enzymes (PAL, SOD, and APx). Besides, Phi application also induced the expression of defense-associated genes (OsCEBiP and OsPDF2.2) in the rice leaf. Furthermore, the Phi application reduced the reactive Malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation) to minimize the cellular damage incited by Magnaporthe in rice.

27641772,Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.,"Hemibiotrophic pathogens are some of the most destructive plant pathogens, causing huge economic losses and threatening global food security. Infection with these organisms often involves an initial biotrophic infection phase, during which the pathogen spreads in host tissue asymptomatically, followed by a necrotrophic phase, during which host-cell death is induced. How hemibiotrophic pathogens trigger host necrosis and how plants inhibit the transition from the biotrophic stage to the necrotrophic stage in disease symptom expression are mainly unknown. The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae spreads in rice biotrophically early during infection, but this biotrophic stage is followed by a pronounced switch to cell death and lesion formation. Here, we show that the M. oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage. Silencing of APIP5 in transgenic rice leads to cell death, and the phenotype is enhanced by the expression of AvrPiz-t. Conversely, Piz-t interacts with and stabilizes APIP5 to prevent necrosis at the necrotrophic stage. At the same time, APIP5 is essential for Piz-t stability. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for the suppression of effector-triggered necrosis at the necrotrophic stage by an NLR receptor in plants.",hemibiotrophic pathogen destructive plant pathogen causing huge economic loss threatening global food security infection organism often involves initial biotrophic infection phase pathogen spread host tissue asymptomatically followed necrotrophic phase hostcell death induced hemibiotrophic pathogen trigger host necrosis plant inhibit transition biotrophic stage necrotrophic stage disease symptom expression mainly unknown rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae spread rice biotrophically early infection biotrophic stage followed pronounced switch cell death lesion formation show oryzae effector avrpizt interacts bziptype transcription factor apip cytoplasm suppresses transcriptional activity protein accumulation necrotrophic stage silencing apip transgenic rice lead cell death phenotype enhanced expression avrpizt conversely pizt interacts stabilizes apip prevent necrosis necrotrophic stage time apip essential pizt stability result demonstrate novel mechanism suppression effectortriggered necrosis necrotrophic stage nlr receptor plant,1,"{'Disease': ['hemibiotrophic pathogen trigger host necrosis plant inhibit transition biotrophic stage necrotrophic stage disease symptom expression', 'mainly unknown rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['hemibiotrophic pathogen trigger host necrosis plant inhibit transition biotrophic stage necrotrophic stage disease symptom expression', 'oryzae effector avrpizt']}",1
26578239,Enhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 in rice.,"Rice is the most important staple food for more than half of the human population, and blast disease is the most serious disease affecting global rice production. In this work, the isoform OsCPK4 of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase family is reported as a regulator of rice immunity to blast fungal infection. It shows that overexpression of OsCPK4 gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration. The constitutive accumulation of OsCPK4 protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and defence gene expression. OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield. Given that OsCPK4 overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways. Altogether, our findings indicate that OsCPK4 is a potential molecular target to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance, but also blast disease resistance of rice crops.",rice important staple food half human population blast disease serious disease affecting global rice production work isoform oscpk rice calciumdependent protein kinase family reported regulator rice immunity blast fungal infection show overexpression oscpk gene rice plant enhances resistance blast disease preventing fungal penetration constitutive accumulation oscpk protein prepares rice plant rapid potentiated defence response including production reactive oxygen specie callose deposition defence gene expression oscpk overexpression lead also constitutive increased content glycosylated salicylic acid hormone leaf without compromising rice yield given oscpk overexpression known confer also salt drought tolerance rice result reported article demonstrate oscpk act convergence component positively modulates biotic abiotic signalling pathway altogether finding indicate oscpk potential molecular target improve abiotic stress tolerance also blast disease resistance rice crop,1,"{'Disease': ['rice important staple food half human population blast disease serious disease', 'resistance blast disease', 'disease resistance rice crop'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
38653755,Phytoalexin sakuranetin attenuates endocytosis and enhances resistance to rice blast.,"Phytoalexin sakuranetin functions in resistance against rice blast. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of sakuranetin remains elusive. Here, we report that rice lines expressing resistance (R) genes were found to contain high levels of sakuranetin, which correlates with attenuated endocytic trafficking of plasma membrane (PM) proteins. Exogenous and endogenous sakuranetin attenuates the endocytosis of various PM proteins and the fungal effector PWL2. Moreover, accumulation of the avirulence protein AvrCO39, resulting from uptake into rice cells by Magnaporthe oryzae, was reduced following treatment with sakuranetin. Pharmacological manipulation of clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) suggests that this pathway is targeted by sakuranetin. Indeed, attenuation of CME by sakuranetin is sufficient to convey resistance against rice blast. Our data reveals a mechanism of rice against M. oryzae by increasing sakuranetin levels and repressing the CME of pathogen effectors, which is distinct from the action of many R genes that mainly function by modulating transcription.",phytoalexin sakuranetin function resistance rice blast however mechanism underlying effect sakuranetin remains elusive report rice line expressing resistance r gene found contain high level sakuranetin correlate attenuated endocytic trafficking plasma membrane pm protein exogenous endogenous sakuranetin attenuates endocytosis various pm protein fungal effector pwl moreover accumulation avirulence protein avrco resulting uptake rice cell magnaporthe oryzae reduced following treatment sakuranetin pharmacological manipulation clathrinmediated endocytic cme suggests pathway targeted sakuranetin indeed attenuation cme sakuranetin sufficient convey resistance rice blast data reveals mechanism rice oryzae increasing sakuranetin level repressing cme pathogen effector distinct action many r gene mainly function modulating transcription,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['treatment sakuranetin pharmacological manipulation'], 'Symptom': ['various pm protein fungal effector pwl']}",4

Most noticeably, shorter plants were significantly correlated with resistance to blast, rice genomes with Pi-ta were associated with lighter seed weights, and the susceptible alleles of RM171 and RM6544 were associated with heavier seed weight.

33845181,Shotgun proteomics coupled to transient-inducible gene silencing reveal rice susceptibility genes as new sources for blast disease resistance.,"A comparative proteomic analysis between two near-isogenic rice lines, displaying a resistant and susceptible phenotype upon infection with Magnaporthe oryzae was performed. We identified and validated factors associated with rice disease susceptibility, representing a flourishing source toward a more resolute rice-blast resistance. Proteome profiles were remarkably different during early infection (12 h post-inoculation), revealing several proteins with increased abundance in the compatible interaction. Potential players of rice susceptibility were selected and gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. Gene Ontology analysis disclosed susceptibility gene-encoded proteins claimed to be involved in fungus sustenance and suppression of plant immunity, such as sucrose synthase 4-like, serpin-ZXA-like, nudix hydrolase15, and DjA2 chaperone protein. Two other candidate genes, picked from a previous transcriptome study, were added into our downstream analysis including pyrabactin resistant-like 5 (OsPYL5), and rice ethylene-responsive factor 104 (OsERF104). Further, we validated their role in susceptibility by Transient-Induced Gene Silencing (TIGS) using short antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides that resulted in a remarkable reduction of foliar disease symptoms in the compatible interaction. Therefore, we successfully employed shotgun proteomics and antisense-based gene silencing to prospect and functionally validate rice potential susceptibility factors, which could be further explored to build rice-blast resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: R gene-mediated disease resistance is race-specific and often not durable in the field. More recently, advancements in new breeding techniques (NBTs) have made plant disease susceptibility genes (S-genes) a new target to build a broad spectrum and more durable resistance, hence an alternative source to R-genes in breeding programs. We successfully coupled shotgun proteomics and gene silencing tools to prospect and validate new rice-bast susceptibility genes that can be further exploited toward a more resolute blast disease resistance.",comparative proteomic analysis two nearisogenic rice line displaying resistant susceptible phenotype upon infection magnaporthe oryzae performed identified validated factor associated rice disease susceptibility representing flourishing source toward resolute riceblast resistance proteome profile remarkably different early infection h postinoculation revealing several protein increased abundance compatible interaction potential player rice susceptibility selected gene expression evaluated rtqpcr gene ontology analysis disclosed susceptibility geneencoded protein claimed involved fungus sustenance suppression plant immunity sucrose synthase like serpinzxalike nudix hydrolase dja chaperone protein two candidate gene picked previous transcriptome study added downstream analysis including pyrabactin resistantlike ospyl rice ethyleneresponsive factor oserf validated role susceptibility transientinduced gene silencing tigs using short antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides resulted remarkable reduction foliar disease symptom compatible interaction therefore successfully employed shotgun proteomics antisensebased gene silencing prospect functionally validate rice potential susceptibility factor could explored build riceblast resistance significance r genemediated disease resistance racespecific often durable field recently advancement new breeding technique nbts made plant disease susceptibility gene sgenes new target build broad spectrum durable resistance hence alternative source rgenes breeding program successfully coupled shotgun proteomics gene silencing tool prospect validate new ricebast susceptibility gene exploited toward resolute blast disease resistance,4,"{'Disease': ['validated factor associated rice disease susceptibility', 'involved fungus sustenance suppression plant immunity', 'resulted remarkable reduction foliar disease symptom compatible interaction', 'plant disease susceptibility gene sgenes new target', 'resolute blast disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['resulted remarkable reduction foliar disease symptom compatible interaction']}",2
25014590,"OsNAC111, a blast disease-responsive transcription factor in rice, positively regulates the expression of defense-related genes.","Plants respond to pathogen attack by transcriptionally regulating defense-related genes via various types of transcription factors. We identified a transcription factor in rice, OsNAC111, belonging to the TERN subgroup of the NAC family that was transcriptionally upregulated after rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) inoculation. OsNAC111 was localized in the nucleus of rice cells and had transcriptional activation activity in yeast and rice cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC111 showed increased resistance to the rice blast fungus. In OsNAC111-overexpressing plants, the expression of several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, was constitutively high compared with the control. These genes all showed blast disease-responsive expression in leaves. Among them, two chitinase genes and one β-1,3-glucanase gene showed reduced expression in transgenic rice plants in which OsNAC111 function was suppressed by a chimeric repressor (OsNAC111-SRDX). OsNAC111 activated transcription from the promoters of the chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase genes in rice cells. In addition, brown pigmentation at the infection sites, a defense response of rice cells to the blast fungus, was lowered in OsNAC111-SRDX plants at the early infection stage.

It is essential to improve disease resistance through environment-friendly methods, while maintaining yield and quality parameters. In this study, jasmonic acid (JA), a plant hormone with anti-fungal activity, was obtained, at both low (100 μmol/L) and high (400 μmol/L) concentrations in rice leaves, before, during, and after infection, respectively. JA could inhibit germination and appressorium formation of rice blast spores in a dose-dependent manner. A total of 400-μmol/L JA treatment significantly enhanced cell viability and endogenous JA level in rice leaves. Furthermore, rice leaves inoculated with Magnaporthe oryzae and sprayed with JA 72 h post-inoculation showed the maximum symptom relief and the highest endogenous JA production among all treatment approaches. The expressions of defense-related genes, OsPR10a and OsAOS2, were highly up-regulated in response to JA, whereas OsEDS1 was down-regulated.

25586962,Gene pyramiding enhances durable blast disease resistance in rice.,"Effective control of blast, a devastating fungal disease of rice, would increase and stabilize worldwide food production. Resistance mediated by quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which usually have smaller individual effects than R-genes but confer broad-spectrum or non-race-specific resistance, is a promising alternative to less durable race-specific resistance for crop improvement, yet evidence that validates the impact of QTL combinations (pyramids) on the durability of plant disease resistance has been lacking. Here, we developed near-isogenic experimental lines representing all possible combinations of four QTL alleles from a durably resistant cultivar. These lines enabled us to evaluate the QTLs singly and in combination in a homogeneous genetic background. We present evidence that pyramiding QTL alleles, each controlling a different response to M. oryzae, confers strong, non-race-specific, environmentally stable resistance to blast disease. Our results suggest that this robust defence system provides durable resistance, thus avoiding an evolutionary ""arms race"" between a crop and its pathogen.",effective control blast devastating fungal disease rice would increase stabilize worldwide food production resistance mediated quantitative trait locus qtls usually smaller individual effect rgenes confer broadspectrum nonracespecific resistance promising alternative less durable racespecific resistance crop improvement yet evidence validates impact qtl combination pyramid durability plant disease resistance lacking developed nearisogenic experimental line representing possible combination four qtl allele durably resistant cultivar line enabled u evaluate qtls singly combination homogeneous genetic background present evidence pyramiding qtl allele controlling different response oryzae confers strong nonracespecific environmentally stable resistance blast disease result suggest robust defence system provides durable resistance thus avoiding evolutionary arm race crop pathogen,3,"{'Disease': ['effective control blast devastating fungal disease rice', 'combination pyramid durability plant disease resistance', 'strong nonracespecific environmentally stable resistance blast disease result'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective control blast devastating fungal disease rice', 'usually smaller individual effect', 'impact']}",4
35705042,A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is essential for plants to manage responses under environmental stress. Plant immune activation requires the ER, but how ER homeostasis is associated with plant immune activation is largely unexplored. Here we find that transcription of an HVA22 family gene, OsHLP1 (HVA22-like protein 1), is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsHLP1 significantly enhances blast disease resistance but impairs ER morphology in rice (Oryza sativa), resulting in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress. OsHLP1 interacts with the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor OsNTL6 at the ER. OsNTL6 localizes to the ER and is relocated to the nucleus after cleavage of the transmembrane domain. OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants. These findings unravel a mechanism whereby OsHLP1 promotes disease resistance by compromising ER homeostasis when plants are infected by pathogens.",endoplasmic reticulum er homeostasis essential plant manage response environmental stress plant immune activation requires er er homeostasis associated plant immune activation largely unexplored find transcription hva family gene oshlp hvalike protein induced magnaporthe oryzae infection overexpression oshlp significantly enhances blast disease resistance impairs er morphology rice oryza sativa resulting enhanced sensitivity er stress oshlp interacts nac nam ataf cuc transcription factor osntl er osntl localizes er relocated nucleus cleavage transmembrane domain oshlp suppresses osntl protein accumulation whereas osntl counteracts oshlp alleviating sensitivity er stress decreasing disease resistance oshlp overexpression plant finding unravel mechanism whereby oshlp promotes disease resistance compromising er homeostasis plant infected pathogen,1,"{'Disease': ['sensitivity er stress decreasing disease resistance', 'disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
39180632,Deciphering early responsive signature genes in rice blast disease: an integrated temporal transcriptomic study.,"Rice blast disease, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, reigns as the top-most cereal killer, jeopardizing global food security. This necessitates the timely scouting of pathogen stress-responsive genes during the early infection stages. Thus, we integrated time-series microarray (GSE95394) and RNA-Seq (GSE131641) datasets to decipher rice transcriptome responses at 12- and 24-h post-infection (Hpi). Our analysis revealed 1580 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) overlapped between datasets. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for these DEGs and identified significant subnetworks using the MCODE plugin. Further analysis with CytoHubba highlighted eight plausible hub genes for pathogenesis: RPL8 (upregulated) and RPL27, OsPRPL3, RPL21, RPL9, RPS5, OsRPS9, and RPL17 (downregulated). We validated the expression levels of these hub genes in response to infection, finding that RPL8 exhibited significantly higher expression compared with other downregulated genes. Remarkably, RPL8 formed a distinct cluster in the co-expression network, whereas other hub genes were interconnected, with RPL9 playing a central role, indicating its pivotal role in coordinating gene expression during infection. Gene Ontology highlighted the enrichment of hub genes in the ribosome and protein translation processes. Prior studies suggested that plant immune defence activation diminishes the energy pool by suppressing ribosomes. Intriguingly, our study aligns with this phenomenon, as the identified ribosomal proteins (RPs) were suppressed, while RPL8 expression was activated. We anticipate that these RPs could be targeted to develop new stress-resistant rice varieties, beyond their housekeeping role. Overall, integrating transcriptomic data revealed more common DEGs, enhancing the reliability of our analysis and providing deeper insights into rice blast disease mechanisms.",rice blast disease caused magnaporthe oryzae reign topmost cereal killer jeopardizing global food security necessitates timely scouting pathogen stressresponsive gene early infection stage thus integrated timeseries microarray gse rnaseq gse datasets decipher rice transcriptome response h postinfection hpi analysis revealed differentially expressed gene degs overlapped datasets constructed proteinprotein interaction ppi network degs identified significant subnetworks using mcode plugin analysis cytohubba highlighted eight plausible hub gene pathogenesis rpl upregulated rpl osprpl rpl rpl rps osrps rpl downregulated validated expression level hub gene response infection finding rpl exhibited significantly higher expression compared downregulated gene remarkably rpl formed distinct cluster coexpression network whereas hub gene interconnected rpl playing central role indicating pivotal role coordinating gene expression infection gene ontology highlighted enrichment hub gene ribosome protein translation process prior study suggested plant immune defence activation diminishes energy pool suppressing ribosome intriguingly study aligns phenomenon identified ribosomal protein rps suppressed rpl expression activated anticipate rps could targeted develop new stressresistant rice variety beyond housekeeping role overall integrating transcriptomic data revealed common degs enhancing reliability analysis providing deeper insight rice blast disease mechanism,1,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'deeper insight rice blast disease mechanism'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
34912119,NLRs guard metabolism to coordinate pattern- and effector-triggered immunity.,"Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants enable them to respond to pathogens by activating the production of defence metabolites that orchestrate immune responses<sup>1-4</sup>. How the production of defence metabolites is promoted by immune receptors and coordinated with broad-spectrum resistance remains elusive. Here we identify the deubiquitinase PICI1 as an immunity hub for PTI and ETI in rice (Oryza sativa). PICI1 deubiquitinates and stabilizes methionine synthetases to activate methionine-mediated immunity principally through biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene. PICI1 is targeted for degradation by blast fungal effectors, including AvrPi9, to dampen PTI. Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptors (NLRs) in the plant immune system, such as PigmR, protect PICI1 from effector-mediated degradation to reboot the methionine-ethylene cascade. Natural variation in the PICI1 gene contributes to divergence in basal blast resistance between the rice subspecies indica and japonica.

All of the tested varieties were highly susceptible to neck blast disease under natural conditions, though no leaf blast symptoms appear on leaves. Neck blast disease increased grain sterility percentages, reduced grain size, yield and quality traits of seeds.

35581907,Surveillance of Rice Blast Resistance Effectiveness and Emerging Virulent Isolates in Taiwan.,"Rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a dangerous threat to rice production and food security worldwide. Breeding and proper deployment of resistant varieties are effective and environmentally friendly strategies to manage this notorious disease. However, a highly dynamic and quickly evolved rice blast pathogen population in the field has made disease control with resistance germplasms more challenging. Therefore, continued monitoring of pathogen dynamics and application of effective resistance varieties are critical tasks to prolong or sustain field resistance. Here, we report a team project that involved evaluation of rice blast resistance genes and surveillance of <i>M. oryzae</i> field populations in Taiwan. A set of International Rice Research Institute-bred blast-resistant lines (IRBLs) carrying single blast resistance genes was utilized to monitor the field effectiveness of rice blast resistance. Resistance genes such as <i>Ptr</i> (formerly <i>Pita2</i>) and <i>Pi9</i> exhibited the best and most durable resistance against the rice blast fungus population in Taiwan. Interestingly, line IRBLb-B harboring the <i>Pib</i> gene with good field protection has recently shown susceptible lesions in some locations.

34739330,Mapping Blast Resistance Genes in Rice Varieties 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202'.,"Rice blast caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (syn. <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i>) is one of the most lethal diseases for sustainable rice production worldwide. Blast resistance mediated by major resistance genes is often broken down after a short period of deployment, while minor blast resistance genes, each providing a small effect on disease reactions, are more durable. In the present study, we first evaluated disease reactions of two rice breeding parents 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202' with 11 blast races, IA45, IB1, IB45, IB49, IB54, IC1, IC17, ID1, IE1, IG1, and IH1, commonly present in the United States, under greenhouse conditions using a category disease rating resembling infection types under field conditions. 'Minghui 63' exhibited differential resistance responses in comparison with those of 'M-202' to the tested blast races. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 275 lines from a cross between 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202' was also evaluated with the above-mentioned blast races. The population was genotyped with 156 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and insertion and deletion (Indel) markers. A linkage map with a genetic distance of 1,022.84 cM was constructed using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) software. A total of 10 resistance QTLs, eight from 'Minghui 63' and two from 'M-202', were identified. One major QTL, <i>qBLAST2</i> on chromosome 2, was identified by seven races/isolates. The remaining nine minor resistance QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

38311793,Effects of Protection Time on Infection of Rice Panicle Blast.,"Panicle blast, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is a destructive disease of rice worldwide. Clarifying the susceptibility of rice panicles at different stages is of great significance for effective disease management. Field experiments were conducted in two paddy fields at Wuyuan County in 2016 and 2017 to determine the effects of head covering and its timing on the infection of rice panicle blast. Results revealed that panicle blast was reduced significantly by covering rice heads with sulfuric acid paper bags, regardless of the covering time, ranging from initial heading to 15 days afterward, suggesting that rice panicles could be infected by blast pathogen even 15 days after initial heading. Panicle blast incidence was also found to be significantly influenced by plant dates, with higher panicle blast incidence observed in plots planted on early dates, suggesting adjusting plant dates could help rice panicles escape the infection by blast pathogen. The results from this study also highlighted the importance of cultivars and environmental conditions to panicle blast. In conclusion, besides planting blast-resistant cultivars, it is important to protect rice heads from the initial heading to the early dough stages, and fungicides should be applied according to infection warnings based on host, inoculum, and weather conditions.",panicle blast caused imagnaporthe oryzaei destructive disease rice worldwide clarifying susceptibility rice panicle different stage great significance effective disease management field experiment conducted two paddy field wuyuan county determine effect head covering timing infection rice panicle blast result revealed panicle blast reduced significantly covering rice head sulfuric acid paper bag regardless covering time ranging initial heading day afterward suggesting rice panicle could infected blast pathogen even day initial heading panicle blast incidence also found significantly influenced plant date higher panicle blast incidence observed plot planted early date suggesting adjusting plant date could help rice panicle escape infection blast pathogen result study also highlighted importance cultivar environmental condition panicle blast conclusion besides planting blastresistant cultivar important protect rice head initial heading early dough stage fungicide applied according infection warning based host inoculum weather condition,1,"{'Disease': ['imagnaporthe oryzaei destructive disease rice', 'susceptibility rice panicle different stage great significance effective disease management field experiment'], 'Treatment': ['susceptibility rice panicle different stage great significance effective disease management field experiment'], 'Symptom': ['susceptibility rice panicle different stage great significance effective disease management field experiment', 'effect head']}",0

To complement conventional breeding method, molecular and transgenic method represents an increasingly important approach for genetic improvement of disease resistance and reduction of pesticide usage. During the past two decades, a wide variety of genes and mechanisms involved in rice defense response have been identified and elucidated. These include components of pathogen recognition, signal transduction, downstream defense-related proteins, and crosstalk among different signaling pathways. In addition, various molecular strategies including use of specialized promoters, modification of target protein structures have been studied and proposed to improve the effectiveness of transgenes.

30632163,Osa-miR398b boosts H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production and rice blast disease-resistance via multiple superoxide dismutases.,"miRNAs contribute to plant resistance against pathogens. Previously, we found that the function of miR398b in immunity in rice differs from that in Arabidopsis. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we characterized the mutants of miR398b target genes and demonstrated that multiple superoxide dismutase genes contribute to miR398b-regulated rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Out of the four target genes of miR398b, mutations in Cu/Zn-Superoxidase Dismutase1 (CSD1), CSD2 and Os11g09780 (Superoxide DismutaseX, SODX) led to enhanced resistance to M. oryzae and increased hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) accumulation. By contrast, mutations in Copper Chaperone for Superoxide Dismutase (CCSD) resulted in enhanced susceptibility. Biochemical studies revealed that csd1, csd2 and sodx displayed altered expression of CSDs and other superoxide dismutase (SOD) family members, leading to increased total SOD enzyme activity that positively contributed to higher H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production. By contrast, the ccsd mutant showed CSD protein deletion, resulting in decreased CSD and total SOD enzyme activity. Our results demonstrate the roles of different SODs in miR398b-regulated resistance to rice blast disease, and uncover an integrative regulatory network in which miR398b boosts total SOD activity to upregulate H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> concentration and thereby improve disease resistance.",mirnas contribute plant resistance pathogen previously found function mirb immunity rice differs arabidopsis however underlying mechanism unclear study characterized mutant mirb target gene demonstrated multiple superoxide dismutase gene contribute mirbregulated rice immunity blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae four target gene mirb mutation cuznsuperoxidase dismutase csd csd osg superoxide dismutasex sodx led enhanced resistance oryzae increased hydrogen peroxide hsubsub osubsub accumulation contrast mutation copper chaperone superoxide dismutase ccsd resulted enhanced susceptibility biochemical study revealed csd csd sodx displayed altered expression csds superoxide dismutase sod family member leading increased total sod enzyme activity positively contributed higher hsubsub osubsub production contrast ccsd mutant showed csd protein deletion resulting decreased csd total sod enzyme activity result demonstrate role different sod mirbregulated resistance rice blast disease uncover integrative regulatory network mirb boost total sod activity upregulate hsubsub osubsub concentration thereby improve disease resistance,3,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
38770581,OsMPK12 positively regulates rice blast resistance via OsEDC4-mediated transcriptional regulation of immune-related genes.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades are functionally important signalling modules in eukaryotes. Transcriptome reprogramming of immune-related genes is a key process in plant immunity. Emerging evidence shows that plant MAPK cascade is associated with processing (P)-body components and contributes to transcriptome reprogramming of immune-related genes. However, it remains largely unknown how this process is regulated. Here, we show that OsMPK12, which is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection, positively regulates rice blast resistance. Further analysis revealed that OsMPK12 directly interacts with enhancer of mRNA decapping protein 4 (OsEDC4), a P-body-located protein, and recruits OsEDC4 to where OsMPK12 is enriched. Importantly, OsEDC4 directly interacts with two decapping complex members OsDCP1 and OsDCP2, indicating that OsEDC4 is a subunit of the mRNA decapping complex. Additionally, we found that OsEDC4 positively regulates rice blast resistance by regulating expression of immune-related genes and maintaining proper mRNA levels of some negatively-regulated genes. And OsMPK12 and OsEDC4 are also involved in rice growth and development regulation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that OsMPK12 positively regulates rice blast resistance via OsEDC4-mediated mRNA decay of immune-related genes, providing new insight into not only the new role of the MAPK signalling cascade, but also posttranscriptional regulation of immune-related genes.",mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk signalling cascade functionally important signalling module eukaryote transcriptome reprogramming immunerelated gene key process plant immunity emerging evidence show plant mapk cascade associated processing pbody component contributes transcriptome reprogramming immunerelated gene however remains largely unknown process regulated show osmpk induced magnaporthe oryzae infection positively regulates rice blast resistance analysis revealed osmpk directly interacts enhancer mrna decapping protein osedc pbodylocated protein recruit osedc osmpk enriched importantly osedc directly interacts two decapping complex member osdcp osdcp indicating osedc subunit mrna decapping complex additionally found osedc positively regulates rice blast resistance regulating expression immunerelated gene maintaining proper mrna level negativelyregulated gene osmpk osedc also involved rice growth development regulation taken together data demonstrate osmpk positively regulates rice blast resistance via osedcmediated mrna decay immunerelated gene providing new insight new role mapk signalling cascade also posttranscriptional regulation immunerelated gene,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
30919975,Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.,"Plants depend on Resistance (R) genes, most of which encode nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, for pathogen race-specific disease resistance. However, only a few immediate downstream targets of R proteins have been characterized, and the signalling pathways for R-protein-induced immunity are largely unknown. In rice (Oryza sativa), NLR proteins serve as important immune receptors in the response to rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We used site-directed mutagenesis to create an autoactive form of the NLR protein PID3 that confers blast resistance and used transgenic rice to test the resulting immunity and gene expression changes. We identified OsRac1, a known GTPase, as a signalling molecule in PID3-mediated blast resistance, implicating OsRac1 as a possible common factor downstream of rice NLR proteins. We also identified RAI1, a transcriptional activator, as a PID3 interactor required for PID3-mediated blast resistance and showed that RAI1 expression is induced by PID3 via a process mediated by OsRac1. This study describes a new signalling pathway for NLR protein-mediated blast resistance and shows that OsRac1 and RAI1 act together to play a critical role in this process.",plant depend resistance r gene encode nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat nlr protein pathogen racespecific disease resistance however immediate downstream target r protein characterized signalling pathway rproteininduced immunity largely unknown rice oryza sativa nlr protein serve important immune receptor response rice blast disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae used sitedirected mutagenesis create autoactive form nlr protein pid confers blast resistance used transgenic rice test resulting immunity gene expression change identified osrac known gtpase signalling molecule pidmediated blast resistance implicating osrac possible common factor downstream rice nlr protein also identified rai transcriptional activator pid interactor required pidmediated blast resistance showed rai expression induced pid via process mediated osrac study describes new signalling pathway nlr proteinmediated blast resistance show osrac rai act together play critical role process,4,"{'Disease': ['nlr protein pathogen racespecific disease resistance', 'important immune receptor response rice blast disease', 'fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2

28472292,Calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK10 mediates both drought tolerance and blast disease resistance in rice plants.,"Plant growth and productivity is negatively affected by different stresses. Most stresses trigger calcium signals that initiate acclimation responses in plants. The multigene family of plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) functions in multiple stress responses by transducing calcium signals into phosphorylation events. This work reports that the OsCPK10 isoform positively mediates tolerance to different stresses in rice plants by enhancing their antioxidant capacity and protecting them from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, with the uncontrolled generation of ROS being a common feature of these stresses. Here, we show that the constitutive accumulation of an HA-tagged OsCPK10 full-length protein enhances the hydrogen peroxide detoxifying capacity of rice plants during desiccation. This is achived by modulating the accumulation of catalase proteins, which reduces the extent of lipid peroxidation and protects the integrity of cell membranes, resulting in drought tolerance. OsCPK10HA accumulation also confers blast disease resistance by interfering with fungal necrotrophic growth via a reduction in the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, we show by bimolecular complementation assays that OsCPK10 is a plasma membrane protein that physically interacts in vivo with catalase A. OsCPK10 therefore appears to be a good molecular target to improve tolerance to abiotic stresses as well as to blast disease, which limit rice crop productivity.",plant growth productivity negatively affected different stress stress trigger calcium signal initiate acclimation response plant multigene family plant calciumdependent protein kinase cpks function multiple stress response transducing calcium signal phosphorylation event work report oscpk isoform positively mediates tolerance different stress rice plant enhancing antioxidant capacity protecting reactive oxygen specie ro damage uncontrolled generation ro common feature stress show constitutive accumulation hatagged oscpk fulllength protein enhances hydrogen peroxide detoxifying capacity rice plant desiccation achived modulating accumulation catalase protein reduces extent lipid peroxidation protects integrity cell membrane resulting drought tolerance oscpkha accumulation also confers blast disease resistance interfering fungal necrotrophic growth via reduction accumulation hydrogen peroxide furthermore show bimolecular complementation assay oscpk plasma membrane protein physically interacts vivo catalase oscpk therefore appears good molecular target improve tolerance abiotic stress well blast disease limit rice crop productivity,1,"{'Disease': ['blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

In the early stage of this study, a strain of Bacillus velezensis with strong inhibition of M. oryzae was isolated and named ZW10. In vitro assays indicated prolonged germination time of conidia of M. oryzae treated with the antifungal substances of ZW10, 78% of the conidia could not form appressorium, and the conidial tubes expanded to form vacuolar structure and then shrank. The results of FDA-PI composite dyes showed that the antifungal substances of ZW10 inhibited the normal activity of M. oryzae hyphae that were rarely able to infect the epidermal cells of rice leaf sheath in vivo tests. In addition, rice treated with the antifungal substances of ZW10 showed a variety of defense responses, including activation of defense-related enzymes, increased expression of the salicylic acid pathway genes, and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which might function directly or indirectly in resistance to pathogen attack. The field experiment with rice blast infection in different periods showed that the antifungal substances of ZW10 had the same control effect as carbendazim.

39146939,Extensive immune receptor repertoire diversity in disease-resistant rice landraces.,"Plants have powerful defense mechanisms and extensive immune receptor repertoires, yet crop monocultures are prone to epidemic diseases. Rice (Oryza sativa) is susceptible to many diseases, such as rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Varietal resistance of rice to blast relies on intracellular nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that recognize specific pathogen molecules and trigger immune responses. In the Yuanyang terraces in southwest China, rice landraces rarely show severe losses to disease whereas commercial inbred lines show pronounced field susceptibility. Here, we investigate within-landrace NLR sequence diversity of nine rice landraces and eleven modern varieties using complexity reduction techniques. We find that NLRs display high sequence diversity in landraces, consistent with balancing selection, and that balancing selection at NLRs is more pervasive in landraces than modern varieties. Notably, modern varieties lack many ancient NLR haplotypes that are retained in some landraces. Our study emphasizes the value of standing genetic variation that is maintained in farmer landraces as a resource to make modern crops and agroecosystems less prone to disease.

35627276,The <i>Pid</i> Family Has Been Diverged into <i>Xian</i> and <i>Geng</i> Type Resistance Genes against Rice Blast Disease.,"Rice blast (the causative agent the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) represents a major constraint on the productivity of one of the world's most important staple food crops. Genes encoding resistance have been identified in both the <i>Xian</i> and <i>Geng</i> subspecies genepools, and combining these within new cultivars represents a rational means of combating the pathogen. In this research, deeper allele mining was carried out on <i>Pid2</i>, <i>Pid3</i>, and <i>Pid4</i> via each comprehensive FNP marker set in three panels consisting of 70 <i>Xian</i> and 58 <i>Geng</i> cultivars. Within <i>Pid2</i>, three functional and one non-functional alleles were identified; the former were only identified in <i>Xian</i> type entries. At <i>Pid3</i>, four functional and one non-functional alleles were identified; once again, all of the former were present in <i>Xian</i> type entries. However, the pattern of variation at <i>Pid4</i> was rather different: here, the five functional alleles uncovered were dispersed across the <i>Geng</i> type germplasm. Among all the twelve candidate functional alleles, both <i>Pid2</i>-ZS and <i>Pid3</i>-ZS were predominant. Furthermore, the resistance functions of both <i>Pid2</i>-ZS and <i>Pid3</i>-ZS were assured by transformation test. Profiting from the merits of three comprehensive FNP marker sets, the study has validated all three members of the <i>Pid</i> family as having been strictly diverged into <i>Xian</i> and <i>Geng</i> subspecies: <i>Pid2</i> and <i>Pid3</i> were defined as <i>Xian</i> type resistance genes, and <i>Pid4</i> as <i>Geng</i> type.

22267486,Effector-mediated suppression of chitin-triggered immunity by magnaporthe oryzae is necessary for rice blast disease.,"Plants use pattern recognition receptors to defend themselves from microbial pathogens. These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate signaling pathways that lead to immunity. In rice (Oryza sativa), the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) recognizes chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell walls of fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae overcomes this first line of plant defense by secreting an effector protein, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), during invasion of new rice cells. We demonstrate that Slp1 accumulates at the interface between the fungal cell wall and the rice plasma membrane, can bind to chitin, and is able to suppress chitin-induced plant immune responses, including generation of reactive oxygen species and plant defense gene expression. Furthermore, we show that Slp1 competes with CEBiP for binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Slp1 is required by M. oryzae for full virulence and exerts a significant effect on tissue invasion and disease lesion expansion. By contrast, gene silencing of CEBiP in rice allows M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease in the absence of Slp1. We propose that Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to prevent PAMP-triggered immunity in rice, thereby facilitating rapid spread of the fungus within host tissue.",plant use pattern recognition receptor defend microbial pathogen receptor recognize pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamps activate signaling pathway lead immunity rice oryza sativa chitin elicitor binding protein cebip recognizes chitin oligosaccharide released cell wall fungal pathogen show rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae overcomes first line plant defense secreting effector protein secreted lysm protein slp invasion new rice cell demonstrate slp accumulates interface fungal cell wall rice plasma membrane bind chitin able suppress chitininduced plant immune response including generation reactive oxygen specie plant defense gene expression furthermore show slp competes cebip binding chitin oligosaccharide slp required oryzae full virulence exerts significant effect tissue invasion disease lesion expansion contrast gene silencing cebip rice allows oryzae cause rice blast disease absence slp propose slp sequesters chitin oligosaccharide prevent pamptriggered immunity rice thereby facilitating rapid spread fungus within host tissue,1,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'oryzae full virulence exerts significant effect tissue invasion disease lesion expansion contrast gene', 'rice blast disease absence slp', 'rapid spread fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['first line plant defense secreting effector protein', 'oryzae full virulence exerts significant effect tissue invasion disease lesion expansion contrast gene']}",1
26158382,Identification of rice blast resistance genes in the elite hybrid rice restorer line Yahui2115.,"Rice blast, caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most serious rice diseases worldwide. We previously developed an elite hybrid rice restorer line with high resistance to rice blast, Yahui2115 (YH2115). To identify the blast resistance genes in YH2115, we first performed expression profiling on previously reported blast resistance genes and disease assay on monogenic lines, and we found that Pi2, Pi9, and Pikm were the most likely resistance candidates in YH2115. Furthermore, RNA interference and linkage analysis demonstrated that silencing of Pi2 reduced the blast resistance of YH2115 and a Pi2 linkage marker was closely associated with blast resistance in an F2 population generated from YH2115. These data suggest that the broad-spectrum blast resistance gene Pi2 contributes greatly to the blast resistance of YH2115. Thus, YH2115 could be used as a new germplasm to facilitate rice blast resistance breeding in hybrid rice breeding programs.",rice blast caused ascomycete fungus magnaporthe oryzae one serious rice disease worldwide previously developed elite hybrid rice restorer line high resistance rice blast yahui yh identify blast resistance gene yh first performed expression profiling previously reported blast resistance gene disease assay monogenic line found pi pi pikm likely resistance candidate yh furthermore rna interference linkage analysis demonstrated silencing pi reduced blast resistance yh pi linkage marker closely associated blast resistance f population generated yh data suggest broadspectrum blast resistance gene pi contributes greatly blast resistance yh thus yh could used new germplasm facilitate rice blast resistance breeding hybrid rice breeding program,1,"{'Disease': ['ascomycete fungus magnaporthe', 'one serious rice disease', 'previously reported blast resistance gene disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
38732268,OsCAMTA3 Negatively Regulates Disease Resistance to <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> by Associating with OsCAMTAPL in Rice.,"Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is one of the most important staple foods worldwide. However, rice blast disease, caused by the ascomycete fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, seriously affects the yield and quality of rice. Calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators (CAMTAs) play vital roles in the response to biotic stresses. In this study, we showed that OsCAMTA3 and CAMTA PROTEIN LIKE (OsCAMTAPL), an OsCAMTA3 homolog that lacks the DNA-binding domain, functioned together in negatively regulating disease resistance in rice. OsCAMTA3 associated with OsCAMTAPL. The <i>oscamta3</i> and <i>oscamtapl</i> mutants showed enhanced resistance compared to wild-type plants, and <i>oscamta3/pl</i> double mutants showed more robust resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i> than <i>oscamta3</i> or <i>oscamtapl</i>. An RNA-Seq analysis revealed that 59 and 73 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed in wild-type plants and <i>oscamta3</i> before and after inoculation with <i>M. oryzae</i>, including <i>OsALDH2B1</i>, an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase that negatively regulates plant immunity. OsCAMTA3 could directly bind to the promoter of <i>OsALDH2B1</i>, and <i>OsALDH2B1</i> expression was decreased in <i>oscamta3</i>, <i>oscamtapl</i>, and <i>oscamta3/pl</i> mutants. In conclusion, OsCAMTA3 associates with OsCAMTAPL to regulate disease resistance by binding and activating the expression of <i>OsALDH2B1</i> in rice, which reveals a strategy by which rice controls rice blast disease and provides important genes for resistance breeding holding a certain positive impact on ensuring food security.",rice ioryza sativai one important staple food worldwide however rice blast disease caused ascomycete fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei seriously affect yield quality rice calmodulinbinding transcriptional activator camtas play vital role response biotic stress study showed oscamta camta protein like oscamtapl oscamta homolog lack dnabinding domain functioned together negatively regulating disease resistance rice oscamta associated oscamtapl ioscamtai ioscamtapli mutant showed enhanced resistance compared wildtype plant ioscamtapli double mutant showed robust resistance im oryzaei ioscamtai ioscamtapli rnaseq analysis revealed gene respectively differentially expressed wildtype plant ioscamtai inoculation im oryzaei including iosaldhbi acetaldehyde dehydrogenase negatively regulates plant immunity oscamta could directly bind promoter iosaldhbi iosaldhbi expression decreased ioscamtai ioscamtapli ioscamtapli mutant conclusion oscamta associate oscamtapl regulate disease resistance binding activating expression iosaldhbi rice reveals strategy rice control rice blast disease provides important gene resistance breeding holding certain positive impact ensuring food security,1,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'ascomycete fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei', 'disease resistance rice', 'disease resistance binding activating expression', 'strategy rice control rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['certain positive impact']}",2
33993496,Transcriptome analysis of rice response to blast fungus identified core genes involved in immunity.,"Rice blast disease caused by the filamentous Ascomycetous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a major threat to rice production worldwide. The mechanisms underlying rice resistance to M. oryzae, such as transcriptional reprogramming and signalling networks, remain elusive. In this study, we carried out an in-depth comparative transcriptome study on the susceptible and resistant rice cultivars in response to M. oryzae. Our analysis highlighted that rapid, high-amplitude transcriptional reprogramming was important for rice defence against blast fungus. Ribosome- and protein translation-related genes were significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 12 hpi in both cultivars, indicating that the protein translation machinery is regulated in the activation of immunity in rice. Furthermore, we identified a core set of genes that are involved in the rice response to both biotic and abiotic stress. More importantly, among the core genes, we demonstrated that the metallothionein OsMT1a and OsMT1b genes positively regulated rice resistance while a peroxidase gene Perox4 negatively regulated rice resistance to M. oryzae.

36050368,Analysis of a rice blast resistance gene Pita-Fuhui2663 and development of selection marker.,"Rice blast is a detrimental rice disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we identified a resistance gene from the rice cultivar Fuhui 2663 which is resistant to the rice blast isolate KJ201. Through isolated population analyses and sequencing approaches, the candidate gene was traced to chromosome 12. With the use of a map-based cloning strategy, the resistance gene was ultimately mapped to an 80-kb resistance locus region containing the Pita gene. Candidate gene prediction and cDNA sequencing indicated that the target resistance gene in Fuhui 2663 was allelic to Pita, thus being referred to as Pita-Fuhui2663 hereafter. Further analysis showed that the Fuhui 2663 protein had one amino acid change: Ala (A) residue 918 in Pita-Fuhui2663 was replaced by Ser (S) in Pita-S, leading to a significant change in the 3D structure of the Pita-S protein. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments confirmed that Pita-Fuhui2663 is responsible for the resistance phenotype of Fuhui 2663. Importantly, Pita-Fuhui2663 did not affect the main agronomic traits of the variety compared to the Pita gene as verified by knockout experiments, indicative of potential applications of Pita-Fuhui2663 in broader breeding programs.

38498220,CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Bsr-d1 enhances the blast resistance of rice in Northeast China.,"The blast resistance allele of OsBsr-d1 does not exist in most japonica rice varieties of Jilin Province in China. The development of Bsr-d1 knockout mutants via CRISPR/Cas9 enhances broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast in Northeast China. Rice blast is a global disease that has a significant negative impact on rice yield and quality. Due to the complexity and variability of the physiological races of rice blast, controlling rice blast is challenging in agricultural production. Bsr-d1, a negative transcription factor that confers broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, was identified in the indica rice cultivar Digu; however, its biological function in japonica rice varieties is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the blast resistance allele of Bsr-d1 in a total of 256 japonica rice varieties from Jilin Province in Northeast China and found that this allele was not present in these varieties. Therefore, we generated Bsr-d1 knockout mutants via the CRISPR/Cas9 system using the japonica rice variety Jigeng88 (JG88) as a recipient variety. Compared with those of the wild-type JG88, the homozygous Bsr-d1 mutant lines KO#1 and KO#2 showed enhanced leaf blast resistance at the seedling stage to several Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) races collected from Jilin Province in Northeast China. Physiological and biochemical indices revealed that the homozygous mutant lines produced more hydrogen peroxide than did JG88 plants when infected with M. oryzae. Comparative RNA-seq revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in the synthesis of amide compounds, zinc finger proteins, transmembrane transporters, etc. In summary, our results indicate that the development of Bsr-d1 knockout mutants through CRISPR/Cas9 can enhance the broad-spectrum resistance of rice in Northeast China to rice blast. This study not only provides a theoretical basis for disease resistance breeding involving the Bsr-d1 gene in Northeast China, but also provides new germplasm resources for disease-resistance rice breeding.",blast resistance allele osbsrd exist japonica rice variety jilin province china development bsrd knockout mutant via crisprcas enhances broadspectrum resistance rice blast northeast china rice blast global disease significant negative impact rice yield quality due complexity variability physiological race rice blast controlling rice blast challenging agricultural production bsrd negative transcription factor confers broadspectrum resistance rice blast identified indica rice cultivar digu however biological function japonica rice variety still unclear study analyzed blast resistance allele bsrd total japonica rice variety jilin province northeast china found allele present variety therefore generated bsrd knockout mutant via crisprcas system using japonica rice variety jigeng jg recipient variety compared wildtype jg homozygous bsrd mutant line ko ko showed enhanced leaf blast resistance seedling stage several magnaporthe oryzae oryzae race collected jilin province northeast china physiological biochemical index revealed homozygous mutant line produced hydrogen peroxide jg plant infected oryzae comparative rnaseq revealed degs mainly involved synthesis amide compound zinc finger protein transmembrane transporter etc summary result indicate development bsrd knockout mutant crisprcas enhance broadspectrum resistance rice northeast china rice blast study provides theoretical basis disease resistance breeding involving bsrd gene northeast china also provides new germplasm resource diseaseresistance rice breeding,1,"{'Disease': ['theoretical basis disease resistance breeding', 'new germplasm resource diseaseresistance rice breeding'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

As a main component of the fungal cell wall, glucan plays an important role in the growth and development of fungi. Glucanase can inhibit the growth of fungi by breaking glycosidic bonds, and may be a promising target for developing rice varieties with broad-spectrum disease resistance. We transferred a codon-optimized β-1,6-glucanase gene (GluM) from myxobacteria into the japonica rice variety Zhonghua11 (ZH11), and obtained a large number of individual transgenic plants with GluM overexpression. Based on molecular analysis, three single-copy homozygous lines with GluM overexpression were selected for assessment of fungal disease resistance at the T<sub>3</sub> generation. Compared with that of the recipient cultivar ZH11, the area of rice blast lesion in transgenic rice was reduced by 82.71%; that of sheath blight lesion was decreased by 35.76%-43.67%; the sheath blight resistance in the field was enhanced by an average of 0.75 grade over 3 years; and the incidence of diseased panicles due to rice false smut was decreased by 65.79%. More importantly, there was no obvious loss of yield (without a significant effect on agronomic traits).

17905473,"Susceptibility of rice to the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea.","The interaction between rice and the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea is the focus of extensive studies on rice disease resistance and fungal infection mechanisms. Here, we review the characteristics of susceptible rice blast infections in terms of physiology, cytology and both host and pathogen transcriptional responses. The success of the infection and the type of disease symptoms strongly depend on environmental and developmental cues. After its penetration into a host cell, the fungus differentiates invasive hyphae that fill up the plant cell lumen and are in direct contact with the membrane of the infected cell. The infected plant cell is alive, displaying considerable vesicle accumulation near the fungus, which is consistent with the establishment of a biotrophic phase at this stage of the infection. Colonization of host tissues by the fungus occurs through the perforation of cell walls from adjacent cells, likely using plasmodesmata as breaking points, or through hyphal growth in the apoplasm. After a few days of biotrophic growth within rice tissues, the fungus switches to a necrotrophic-like phase associated with the onset of sporulation, leading to visible lesions. Genome-wide transcriptomic studies have shown that classical plant defence responses are triggered during a susceptible infection, although the kinetics and amplitude of these responses are slower and lower than in resistant interactions. Infected rice cells are submitted to an intense transcriptional reprogramming, where responses to hormones such as auxins, abscissic acid and jasmonates are likely involved. Consistent with the extensive plant-fungal exchanges during the biotrophic phase, many rice genes expressed during infection encode plasma membrane proteins. At the onset of lesion formation (5 days after the start of infection), M. grisea is actively reprogramming its transcription towards active DNA, RNA and protein syntheses to sustain its rapid growth in infected tissues. A striking characteristic of M. grisea genes expressed at this stage of the infection is the over-representation of genes encoding secreted proteins, mainly of unknown function. However, some of these secreted proteins are enzymes involved in cell wall, protein and lipid degradation, suggesting that the fungus is starting to degrade host polymers and cell walls or is remodelling its own cell wall. The next challenge will be to decipher the role of these induced plant and fungal genes in the susceptible interaction.",interaction rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea focus extensive study rice disease resistance fungal infection mechanism review characteristic susceptible rice blast infection term physiology cytology host pathogen transcriptional response success infection type disease symptom strongly depend environmental developmental cue penetration host cell fungus differentiates invasive hypha fill plant cell lumen direct contact membrane infected cell infected plant cell alive displaying considerable vesicle accumulation near fungus consistent establishment biotrophic phase stage infection colonization host tissue fungus occurs perforation cell wall adjacent cell likely using plasmodesmata breaking point hyphal growth apoplasm day biotrophic growth within rice tissue fungus switch necrotrophiclike phase associated onset sporulation leading visible lesion genomewide transcriptomic study shown classical plant defence response triggered susceptible infection although kinetics amplitude response slower lower resistant interaction infected rice cell submitted intense transcriptional reprogramming response hormone auxin abscissic acid jasmonates likely involved consistent extensive plantfungal exchange biotrophic phase many rice gene expressed infection encode plasma membrane protein onset lesion formation day start infection grisea actively reprogramming transcription towards active dna rna protein synthesis sustain rapid growth infected tissue striking characteristic grisea gene expressed stage infection overrepresentation gene encoding secreted protein mainly unknown function however secreted protein enzyme involved cell wall protein lipid degradation suggesting fungus starting degrade host polymer cell wall remodelling cell wall next challenge decipher role induced plant fungal gene susceptible interaction,1,"{'Disease': ['interaction rice blast fungus magnaporthe', 'grisea focus extensive study rice disease resistance fungal infection mechanism', 'characteristic susceptible rice blast infection term physiology cytology host pathogen transcriptional response success infection type disease symptom', 'environmental developmental cue penetration host cell fungus differentiates invasive hypha fill plant cell lumen direct contact membrane infected cell infected plant cell', 'fungus', 'rice tissue fungus switch necrotrophiclike phase associated onset sporulation', 'fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['characteristic susceptible rice blast infection term physiology cytology host pathogen transcriptional response success infection type disease symptom']}",1

34102436,Role of silicon in elevating resistance against sheath blight and blast diseases in rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani, are the two major diseases of rice that cause enormous losses in rice production worldwide. Identification and utilization of broad-spectrum resistance resources have been considered sustainable and effective strategies. However, the majority of the resistance genes and QTLs identified have often been found to be race-specific, and their resistance is frequently broken down due to continuous exposure to the pathogen. Therefore, integrated approaches to improve plant resistance against such devastating pathogen have great importance. Silicon (Si), a beneficial element for plant growth, has shown to provide a prophylactic effect against many pathogens. The application of Si helps the plants to combat the disease-causing pathogens, either through its deposition in different parts of the plant or through modulation/induction of specific defense genes by yet an unknown mechanism. Some reports have shown that Si imparts resistance to rice blast and sheath blight. The present review summarizes the mechanism of Si transport and deposition and its effect on rice growth and development.

24043853,WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance.,"OsWRKY76 encodes a group IIa WRKY transcription factor of rice. The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid. Green fluorescent protein-fused OsWRKY76 localized to the nuclei in rice epidermal cells. OsWRKY76 showed sequence-specific DNA binding to the W-box element in vitro and exhibited W-box-mediated transcriptional repressor activity in cultured rice cells. Overexpression of OsWRKY76 in rice plants resulted in drastically increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, but improved tolerance to cold stress. Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non-transformed control plants. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress-associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance.",oswrky encodes group iia wrky transcription factor rice expression oswrky induced within h inoculation rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae wounding low temperature benzothiadiazole abscisic acid green fluorescent proteinfused oswrky localized nucleus rice epidermal cell oswrky showed sequencespecific dna binding wbox element vitro exhibited wboxmediated transcriptional repressor activity cultured rice cell overexpression oswrky rice plant resulted drastically increased susceptibility oryzae improved tolerance cold stress microarray analysis revealed overexpression oswrky suppresses induction specific set pr gene gene involved phytoalexin synthesis inoculation blast fungus consistent observation level phytoalexins transgenic rice plant remained significantly lower nontransformed control plant furthermore overexpression oswrky led increased expression abiotic stressassociated gene peroxidase lipid metabolism gene result strongly suggest oswrky play dual opposing role blast disease resistance cold tolerance,1,"{'Disease': ['h inoculation rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'phytoalexin synthesis inoculation blast fungus consistent observation level', 'dual opposing role blast disease resistance cold tolerance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
38704696,De-nitrosylation Coordinates Appressorium Function for Infection of the Rice Blast Fungus.,"As a signaling molecule, nitric oxide (NO) regulates the development and stress response in different organisms. The major biological activity of NO is protein S-nitrosylation, whose function in fungi remains largely unclear. Here, it is found in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, de-nitrosylation process is essential for functional appressorium formation during infection. Nitrosative stress caused by excessive accumulation of NO is harmful for fungal infection. While the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase GSNOR-mediated de-nitrosylation removes excess NO toxicity during appressorium formation to promote infection. Through an indoTMT switch labeling proteomics technique, 741 S-nitrosylation sites in 483 proteins are identified. Key appressorial proteins, such as Mgb1, MagB, Sps1, Cdc42, and septins, are activated by GSNOR through de-nitrosylation. Removing S-nitrosylation sites of above proteins is essential for proper protein structure and appressorial function. Therefore, GSNOR-mediated de-nitrosylation is an essential regulator for appressorium formation. It is also shown that breaking NO homeostasis by NO donors, NO scavengers, as well as chemical inhibitor of GSNOR, shall be effective methods for fungal disease control.",signaling molecule nitric oxide regulates development stress response different organism major biological activity protein snitrosylation whose function fungi remains largely unclear found rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae denitrosylation process essential functional appressorium formation infection nitrosative stress caused excessive accumulation harmful fungal infection snitrosoglutathione reductase gsnormediated denitrosylation remove excess toxicity appressorium formation promote infection indotmt switch labeling proteomics technique snitrosylation site protein identified key appressorial protein mgb magb sps cdc septins activated gsnor denitrosylation removing snitrosylation site protein essential proper protein structure appressorial function therefore gsnormediated denitrosylation essential regulator appressorium formation also shown breaking homeostasis donor scavenger well chemical inhibitor gsnor shall effective method fungal disease control,4,"{'Disease': ['found rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae denitrosylation process essential functional appressorium formation infection nitrosative stress', 'effective method fungal disease control'], 'Treatment': ['effective method fungal disease control'], 'Symptom': ['effective method fungal disease control']}",3

Due to the complicated procedure of panicle blast identification and instability of panicle blast infection influenced by the environment, most cloned rice resistance genes are associated with leaf blast. In this study, a rice panicle blast resistance gene, <i>Pb2</i>, was identified by genome-wide association mapping based on the panicle blast resistance phenotypes of 230 Rice Diversity Panel 1 (RDP1) accessions with 700,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A genome-wide association study identified 18 panicle blast resistance loci (PBRL) within two years, including 9 reported loci and 2 repeated loci (PBRL2 and PBRL13, PBRL10 and PBRL18). Among them, the repeated locus (PBRL10 and PBRL18) was located in chromosome 11. By haplotype and expression analysis, one of the Nucleotide-binding domain and Leucine-rich Repeat (NLR) <i>Pb2</i> genes was highly conserved in multiple resistant rice cultivars, and its expression was significantly upregulated after rice blast infection. <i>Pb2</i> encodes a typical NBS-LRR protein with NB-ARC domain and LRR domain. Compared with wild type plants, the transgenic rice of <i>Pb2</i> showed enhanced resistance to panicle and leaf blast with reduced lesion number. Subcellular localization of Pb2 showed that it is located on plasma membrane, and GUS tissue-staining observation found that <i>Pb2</i> is highly expressed in grains, leaf tips and stem nodes.

18513376,Physiological and cytological mechanisms of silicon-induced resistance in rice against blast disease.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the most destructive diseases in the rice-growing areas of the world. Silicon is an important nutritional element especially for rice. Two near-isogenic lines of rice with different resistance to blast disease, i.e. CO39 (susceptible) and C101LAC (Pi-1) (resistant), were selected to determine the effects of Si amendment on the severity and incidence of rice blast disease. The physiological and cytological mechanisms involved in the induced disease resistance by silicon were investigated. Exogenous Si application at a concentration of 2 mM reduced the disease index by 45% for CO39 and 56% for C101LAC (Pi-1). Si application alone did not change lignin content and the activities of defense-related enzymes including peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in rice leaves of both isogenic lines. However, after inoculation with M. grisea, Si-treated rice plants significantly increased the activities of POD, PPO and PAL in leaves of both isogenic lines. Si and lignin content were also significantly increased in Si-treated inoculated seedlings. Environmental scanning electron microscope observations revealed that Si amendment resulted in higher Si deposit on dumbbell bodies in the rice leaves and silicon papilla accumulation on the guard cell of stoma. These results suggest that silicon-induced defense response and cell silicification of rice leaves altogether contribute to the silicon-induced rice resistance to blast disease.",rice oryza sativa l blast disease caused magnaporthe grisea one destructive disease ricegrowing area world silicon important nutritional element especially rice two nearisogenic line rice different resistance blast disease ie co susceptible clac pi resistant selected determine effect si amendment severity incidence rice blast disease physiological cytological mechanism involved induced disease resistance silicon investigated exogenous si application concentration mm reduced disease index co clac pi si application alone change lignin content activity defenserelated enzyme including peroxidase pod polyphenol oxidase ppo phenylalanine ammonialyase pal rice leaf isogenic line however inoculation grisea sitreated rice plant significantly increased activity pod ppo pal leaf isogenic line si lignin content also significantly increased sitreated inoculated seedling environmental scanning electron microscope observation revealed si amendment resulted higher si deposit dumbbell body rice leaf silicon papilla accumulation guard cell stoma result suggest siliconinduced defense response cell silicification rice leaf altogether contribute siliconinduced rice resistance blast disease,3,"{'Disease': ['rice oryza sativa l blast disease', 'magnaporthe grisea one destructive disease ricegrowing area world silicon important nutritional element', 'induced disease resistance silicon', 'mm reduced disease index co clac pi si application', 'siliconinduced rice resistance blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['ie co susceptible clac pi resistant selected determine effect']}",3
38808386,The F-box protein OsFBX156 positively regulates rice defence against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by mediating ubiquitination-dependent degradation of OsHSP71.1.,"F-box protein is a subunit of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a critical role in regulating different pathways in plant immunity. In this study, we identified the rice (Oryza sativa) F-box protein OsFBX156, which targets the heat shock protein 70 (OsHSP71.1) to regulate resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of OsFBX156 or knockout of OsHSP71.1 in rice resulted in the elevation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and an induction burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after flg22 and chitin treatments, thereby enhancing resistance to M. oryzae. Furthermore, OsFBX156 can promote the degradation of OsHSP71.1 through the 26S proteasome pathway.

28128411,Genetic analysis and identification of SSR markers associated with rice blast disease in a BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> backcross population.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast disease is one of the most destructive rice diseases in the world. The fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae, is the causal agent of rice blast disease. Development of resistant cultivars is the most preferred method to achieve sustainable rice production. However, the effectiveness of resistant cultivars is hindered by the genetic plasticity of the pathogen genome. Therefore, information on genetic resistance and virulence stability are vital to increase our understanding of the molecular basis of blast disease resistance. The present study set out to elucidate the resistance pattern and identify potential simple sequence repeat markers linked with rice blast disease. A backcross population (BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub>), derived from crossing MR264 and Pongsu Seribu 2 (PS2), was developed using marker-assisted backcross breeding. Twelve microsatellite markers carrying the blast resistance gene clearly demonstrated a polymorphic pattern between both parental lines. Among these, two markers, RM206 and RM5961, located on chromosome 11 exhibited the expected 1:1 testcross ratio in the BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> population. The 195 BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> plants inoculated against M. oryzae pathotype P7.2 showed a significantly different distribution in the backcrossed generation and followed Mendelian segregation based on a single-gene model. This indicates that blast resistance in PS2 is governed by a single dominant gene, which is linked to RM206 and RM5961 on chromosome 11.

37833893,Improvement of Rice Blast Resistance in TGMS Line HD9802S through Optimized Anther Culture and Molecular Marker-Assisted Selection.,"Rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is one of the most serious rice diseases worldwide. The early <i>indica</i> rice thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line HD9802S has the characteristics of stable fertility, reproducibility, a high outcrossing rate, excellent rice quality, and strong combining ability. However, this line exhibits poor blast resistance and is highly susceptible to leaf and neck blasts. In this study, backcross introduction, molecular marker-assisted selection, gene chipping, anther culture, and resistance identification in the field were used to introduce the broad-spectrum blast-resistance gene <i>R6</i> into HD9802S to improve its rice blast resistance. Six induction media were prepared by varying the content of each component in the culture medium.

34608507,Cloning and functional analysis of the novel rice blast resistance gene Pi65 in japonica rice.,"Pi65, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) domain cloned from Oryza sativa japonica, is a novel rice blast disease resistance gene. Rice blast seriously threatens rice production worldwide. Utilizing the rice blast resistance gene to breed rice blast-resistant varieties is one of the best ways to control rice blast disease. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we cloned a novel rice blast resistance gene, Pi65, from the resistant variety GangYu129 (abbreviated GY129, Oryza sativa japonica). Overexpression of Pi65 in the susceptible variety LiaoXing1 (abbreviated LX1, Oryza sativa japonica) enhanced rice blast resistance, while knockout of Pi65 in GY129 resulted in susceptibility to rice blast disease. Pi65 encodes two transmembrane domains, with 15 LRR domains and one serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain, conferring resistance to isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae (abbreviated M. oryzae) collected from Northeast China. There were sixteen amino acid differences between the Pi65 resistance and susceptible alleles. Compared with the Pi65-resistant allele, the susceptible allele exhibited one LRR domain deletion. Pi65 was constitutively expressed in whole plants, and it could be induced in the early stage of M. oryzae infection. Transcriptome analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with disease resistance were specifically upregulated in GY129 24 h post inoculation (HPI); in contrast, photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were particularly downregulated at 24 HPI, demonstrating that disease resistance-associated genes were activated in GY129 (carrying Pi65) after rice blast fungal infection and that cellular basal metabolism and energy metabolism were inhibited simultaneously.

39087779,A novel Pik allele confers extended resistance to rice blast.,"In the ongoing arms race between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae, the pathogen employs effectors to evade the immune response, while the host develops resistance genes to recognise these effectors and confer resistance. In this study, we identified a novel Pik allele, Pik-W25, from wild rice WR25 through bulked-segregant analysis, creating the Pik-W25 NIL (Near-isogenic Lines) named G9. Pik-W25 conferred resistance to isolates expressing AvrPik-C/D/E alleles. CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to generate transgenic lines with a loss of function in Pik-W25-1 and Pik-W25-2, resulting in loss of resistance in G9 to isolates expressing the three alleles, confirming that Pik-W25-induced immunity required both Pik-W25-1 and Pik-W25-2. Yeast two-hybrid (Y<sub>2</sub>H) and split luciferase complementation assays showed interactions between Pik-W25-1 and the three alleles, while Pik-W25-2 could not interact with AvrPik-C, -D, and -E alleles with Y<sub>2</sub>H assay, indicating Pik-W25-1 acts as an adaptor and Pik-W25-2 transduces the signal to trigger resistance. The Pik-W25 NIL exhibited enhanced field resistance to leaf and panicle blast without significant changes in morphology or development compared to the parent variety CO39, suggesting its potential for resistance breeding.

The number of cloned M. oryzae avirulence effector genes has recently doubled, largely based on resequencing with a Japanese field isolate and association of avirulence activity with presence/absence polymorphisms in novel genes for secreted proteins. Effectors secreted by hyphae in rice cells accumulate in biotrophic interfacial complexes, and this property correlates with their translocation across plasma membrane into the rice cytoplasm.

Naturally occurring root-associated rhizospheric bacteria were isolated from California field grown rice plants (M-104), eleven of which were taxonomically identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Bacterial isolates were tested for biocontrol activity against the devastating foliar rice fungal pathogen, M. oryzae pathovar 70-15. In vitro, a Pseudomonas isolate, EA105, displayed antibiosis through reducing appressoria formation by nearly 90% as well as directly inhibiting fungal growth by 76%. Although hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a volatile commonly produced by biocontrol pseudomonads, the activity of EA105 seems to be independent of its HCN production. During in planta experiments, EA105 reduced the number of blast lesions formed by 33% and Pantoea agglomerans isolate, EA106 by 46%. Our data also show both EA105 and EA106 trigger jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) response in rice. Out of 11 bacteria isolated from rice soil, pseudomonad EA105 most effectively inhibited the growth and appressoria formation of M. oryzae through a mechanism that is independent of cyanide production. In addition to direct antagonism, EA105 also appears to trigger ISR in rice plants through a mechanism that is dependent on JA and ET signaling, ultimately resulting in fewer blast lesions. The application of native bacteria as biocontrol agents in combination with current disease protection strategies could aid in global food security.",natural interaction plant root rhizospheric microbiome vital plant fitness modulating growth promotion disease suppression rice oryza sativa globally important food crop much yield lost due blast disease caused fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae capitalizing ability naturally occurring rice soil bacteria reduce oryzae infection could provide sustainable solution reduce amount crop lost blast disease naturally occurring rootassociated rhizospheric bacteria isolated california field grown rice plant eleven taxonomically identified rrna gene sequencing fatty acid methyl ester fame analysis bacterial isolates tested biocontrol activity devastating foliar rice fungal pathogen oryzae pathovar vitro pseudomonas isolate ea displayed antibiosis reducing appressoria formation nearly well directly inhibiting fungal growth although hydrogen cyanide hcn volatile commonly produced biocontrol pseudomonad activity ea seems independent hcn production planta experiment ea reduced number blast lesion formed pantoea agglomerans isolate ea data also show ea ea trigger jasmonic acid ja ethylene et dependent induced systemic resistance isr response rice bacteria isolated rice soil pseudomonad ea effectively inhibited growth appressoria formation oryzae mechanism independent cyanide production addition direct antagonism ea also appears trigger isr rice plant mechanism dependent ja et signaling ultimately resulting fewer blast lesion application native bacteria biocontrol agent combination current disease protection strategy could aid global food security,2,"{'Disease': ['natural interaction plant root rhizospheric microbiome vital plant fitness modulating growth promotion disease suppression rice oryza sativa globally important food crop much yield', 'due blast disease', 'amount crop lost blast disease', 'fewer blast lesion application native bacteria biocontrol agent combination current disease protection strategy'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
28418377,The Magnaporthe oryzae nitrooxidative stress response suppresses rice innate immunity during blast disease.,"Understanding how microorganisms manipulate plant innate immunity and colonize host cells is a major goal of plant pathology. Here, we report that the fungal nitrooxidative stress response suppresses host defences to facilitate the growth and development of the important rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in leaf cells. Nitronate monooxygenases encoded by NMO genes catalyse the oxidative denitrification of nitroalkanes. We show that the M. oryzae NMO2 gene is required for mitigating damaging lipid nitration under nitrooxidative stress conditions and, consequently, for using nitrate and nitrite as nitrogen sources. On plants, the Δnmo2 mutant strain penetrated host cuticles like wild type, but invasive hyphal growth in rice cells was restricted and elicited plant immune responses that included the formation of cellular deposits and a host reactive oxygen species burst. Development of the M. oryzae effector-secreting biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) was misregulated in the Δnmo2 mutant. Inhibiting or quenching host reactive oxygen species suppressed rice innate immune responses and allowed the Δnmo2 mutant to grow and develop normally in infected cells. NMO2 is thus essential for mitigating nitrooxidative cellular damage and, in rice cells, maintaining redox balance to avoid triggering plant defences that impact M. oryzae growth and BIC development.",understanding microorganism manipulate plant innate immunity colonize host cell major goal plant pathology report fungal nitrooxidative stress response suppresses host defence facilitate growth development important rice pathogen magnaporthe oryzae leaf cell nitronate monooxygenases encoded nmo gene catalyse oxidative denitrification nitroalkanes show oryzae nmo gene required mitigating damaging lipid nitration nitrooxidative stress condition consequently using nitrate nitrite nitrogen source plant δnmo mutant strain penetrated host cuticle like wild type invasive hyphal growth rice cell restricted elicited plant immune response included formation cellular deposit host reactive oxygen specie burst development oryzae effectorsecreting biotrophic interfacial complex bic misregulated δnmo mutant inhibiting quenching host reactive oxygen specie suppressed rice innate immune response allowed δnmo mutant grow develop normally infected cell nmo thus essential mitigating nitrooxidative cellular damage rice cell maintaining redox balance avoid triggering plant defence impact oryzae growth bic development,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['plant defence impact']}",1
38825969,Proteomic signatures uncover phenotypic plasticity of susceptible and resistant genotypes by wall remodelers in rice blast.,"Molecular communication between macromolecules dictates extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics during pathogen recognition and disease development. Extensive research has shed light on how plant immune components are activated, regulated and function in response to pathogen attack. However, two key questions remain largely unresolved: (i) how does ECM dynamics govern susceptibility and disease resistance, (ii) what are the components that underpin these phenomena? Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae adversely affects rice productivity. To understand ECM regulated genotype-phenotype plasticity in blast disease, we temporally profiled two contrasting rice genotypes in disease and immune state. Morpho-histological, biochemical and electron microscopy analyses revealed that increased necrotic lesions accompanied by electrolyte leakage governs disease state. Wall carbohydrate quantification showed changes in pectin level was more significant in blast susceptible compared to blast resistant cultivar. Temporally resolved quantitative disease- and immune-responsive ECM proteomes identified 308 and 334 proteins, respectively involved in wall remodelling and integrity, signalling and disease/immune response. Pairwise comparisons between time and treatment, messenger ribonucleic acid expression, diseasome and immunome networks revealed novel blast-related functional modules.

38294722,Unveiling the mechanism of broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice: The collaborative role of transcription factor OsGRAS30 and histone deacetylase OsHDAC1.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, significantly impacts grain yield, necessitating the identification of broad-spectrum resistance genes and their functional mechanisms for disease-resistant crop breeding. Here, we report that rice with knockdown OsHDAC1 gene expression displays enhanced broad-spectrum blast resistance without effects on plant height and tiller numbers compared to wild-type rice, while rice overexpressing OsHDAC1 is more susceptible to M. oryzae. We identify a novel blast resistance transcription factor, OsGRAS30, which genetically acts upstream of OsHDAC1 and interacts with OsHDAC1 to suppress its enzymatic activity. This inhibition increases the histone H3K27ac level, thereby boosting broad-spectrum blast resistance. Integrating genome-wide mapping of OsHDAC1 and H3K27ac targets with RNA sequencing analysis unveils how OsHDAC1 mediates the expression of OsSSI2, OsF3H, OsRLR1 and OsRGA5 to regulate blast resistance. Our findings reveal that the OsGRAS30-OsHDAC1 module is critical to rice blast control.

31296569,Cross-reactivity of a rice NLR immune receptor to distinct effectors from the rice blast pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> provides partial disease resistance.,"Unconventional integrated domains in plant intracellular immune receptors of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLRs) type can directly bind translocated effector proteins from pathogens and thereby initiate an immune response. The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) immune receptor pairs Pik-1/Pik-2 and RGA5/RGA4 both use integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domains to bind the effectors AVR-Pik and AVR-Pia, respectively, from the rice blast fungal pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> These effectors both belong to the MAX effector family and share a core structural fold, despite being divergent in sequence. How integrated domains in NLRs maintain specificity of effector recognition, even of structurally similar effectors, has implications for understanding plant immune receptor evolution and function. Here, using plant cell death and pathogenicity assays and protein-protein interaction analyses, we show that the rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 triggers an immune response leading to partial disease resistance toward the ""mis-matched"" effector AVR-Pia <i>in planta</i> and that the Pikp-HMA domain binds AVR-Pia <i>in vitro</i> We observed that the HMA domain from another Pik-1 allele, Pikm, cannot bind AVR-Pia, and it does not trigger a plant response. The crystal structure of Pikp-HMA bound to AVR-Pia at 1.9 Å resolution revealed a binding interface different from those formed with AVR-Pik effectors, suggesting plasticity in integrated domain-effector interactions.

In the present study, we identified that GF14e was highly expressed in panicles and was induced in panicles infected by blast pathogen. Overexpression of GF14e enhances resistance to panicle blast whereas silencing GF14e results in increased susceptibility to panicle blast, suggesting that GF14e plays a positive role in quantitative panicle blast resistance in rice. Our results also demonstrate that GF14e is regulated by WRKY71 and GF14e-mediated panicle blast resistance is related to activation of SA-dependent pathway and suppression of JA-dependent pathway.

BV6, that is isolated from rice roots and its biocontrol potential against rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. We evaluated the ability to isolate BV6 in the biological control of rice blast disease and investigated its antifungal mechanisms. BV6 strongly inhibited the hyphal growth of M. oryzae Guy11 and other plant pathogenic fungi, and pot experiments showed that BV6 significantly decreases the disease index of rice blast from 47.5 to 24.6. The secreted small-molecule secondary metabolites were regarded as weapons during the antifungal process by inhibiting the germination of M. oryzae conidia and mycelial growth, and thereby prevent the following infection. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the metabolites from the supernatant of isolate BV6 showed that the antifungal weapons of isolate BV6 are novel, small, molecular hydrophilic compounds that are different from reported antifungal compounds. The isolate BV6 inhibits the M. oryzae infection by the production of small-molecule antifungal compounds. The current study discovers the role of the Burkholderia sp.

34728643,Accumulating candidate genes for broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast in a drought-tolerant rice cultivar.,"Biotic stresses, including diseases, severely affect rice production, compromising producers' ability to meet increasing global consumption. Understanding quantitative responses for resistance to diverse pathogens can guide development of reliable molecular markers, which, combined with advanced backcross populations, can accelerate the production of more resistant varieties. A candidate gene (CG) approach was used to accumulate different disease QTL from Moroberekan, a blast-resistant rice variety, into Vandana, a drought-tolerant variety. The advanced backcross progeny were evaluated for resistance to blast and tolerance to drought at five sites in India and the Philippines. Gene-based markers were designed to determine introgression of Moroberekan alleles for 11 CGs into the progeny. Six CGs, coding for chitinase, HSP90, oxalate oxidase, germin-like proteins, peroxidase and thaumatin-like protein, and 21 SSR markers were significantly associated with resistance to blast across screening sites. Multiple lines with different combinations, classes and numbers of CGs were associated with significant levels of race non-specific resistance to rice blast and sheath blight. Overall, the level of resistance effective in multiple locations was proportional to the number of CG alleles accumulated in advanced breeding lines.

33672641,Understanding Rice-<i>Magnaporthe Oryzae</i> Interaction in Resistant and Susceptible Cultivars of Rice under Panicle Blast Infection Using a Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis.,"Rice blast is a global threat to food security with up to 50% yield losses. Panicle blast is a more severe form of rice blast and the response of rice plant to leaf and panicle blast is distinct in different genotypes. To understand the specific response of rice in panicle blast, transcriptome analysis of blast resistant cultivar Tetep, and susceptible cultivar HP2216 was carried out using RNA-Seq approach after 48, 72 and 96 h of infection with <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> along with mock inoculation. Transcriptome data analysis of infected panicle tissues revealed that 3553 genes differentially expressed in HP2216 and 2491 genes in Tetep, which must be the responsible factor behind the differential disease response. The defense responsive genes are involved mainly in defense pathways namely, hormonal regulation, synthesis of reactive oxygen species, secondary metabolites and cell wall modification. The common differentially expressed genes in both the cultivars were defense responsive transcription factors, NBS-LRR genes, kinases, pathogenesis related genes and peroxidases. In Tetep, cell wall strengthening pathway represented by PMR5, dirigent, tubulin, cell wall proteins, chitinases, and proteases was found to be specifically enriched. Additionally, many novel genes having DOMON, VWF, and PCaP1 domains which are specific to cell membrane were highly expressed only in Tetep post infection, suggesting their role in panicle blast resistance. Thus, our study shows that panicle blast resistance is a complex phenomenon contributed by early defense response through ROS production and detoxification, MAPK and LRR signaling, accumulation of antimicrobial compounds and secondary metabolites, and cell wall strengthening to prevent the entry and spread of the fungi.

38834685,The unconventional resistance protein PTR recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pita in an allele-specific manner.,"Blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating rice diseases. Disease resistance genes such as Pi-ta or Pi-ta2 are critical in protecting rice production from blast. Published work reports that Pi-ta codes for a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain protein (NLR) that recognizes the fungal protease-like effector AVR-Pita by direct binding. However, this model was challenged by the recent discovery that Pi-ta2 resistance, which also relies on AVR-Pita detection, is conferred by the unconventional resistance gene Ptr, which codes for a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic armadillo repeat domain. Here, using NLR Pi-ta and Ptr RNAi knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutant rice lines, we found that AVR-Pita recognition relies solely on Ptr and that the NLR Pi-ta has no role in it, indicating that it is not the Pi-ta resistance gene. Different alleles of Ptr confer different recognition specificities. The A allele of Ptr (PtrA) detects all natural sequence variants of the effector and confers Pi-ta2 resistance, while the B allele of Ptr (PtrB) recognizes a restricted set of AVR-Pita alleles and, thereby, confers Pi-ta resistance. Analysis of the natural diversity in AVR-Pita and of mutant and transgenic strains identified one specific polymorphism in the effector sequence that controls escape from PtrB-mediated resistance. Taken together, our work establishes that the M. oryzae effector AVR-Pita is detected in an allele-specific manner by the unconventional rice resistance protein Ptr and that the NLR Pi-ta has no function in Pi-ta resistance and the recognition of AVR-Pita.",blast disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating rice disease disease resistance gene pita pita critical protecting rice production blast published work report pita code nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat domain protein nlr recognizes fungal proteaselike effector avrpita direct binding however model challenged recent discovery pita resistance also relies avrpita detection conferred unconventional resistance gene ptr code membrane protein cytoplasmic armadillo repeat domain using nlr pita ptr rnai knockdown crisprcas knockout mutant rice line found avrpita recognition relies solely ptr nlr pita role indicating pita resistance gene different allele ptr confer different recognition specificity allele ptr ptra detects natural sequence variant effector confers pita resistance b allele ptr ptrb recognizes restricted set avrpita allele thereby confers pita resistance analysis natural diversity avrpita mutant transgenic strain identified one specific polymorphism effector sequence control escape ptrbmediated resistance taken together work establishes oryzae effector avrpita detected allelespecific manner unconventional rice resistance protein ptr nlr pita function pita resistance recognition avrpita,4,"{'Disease': ['blast disease', 'fungus magnaporthe', 'one devastating rice disease disease resistance gene pita pita critical protecting rice production blast'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['fungal proteaselike effector avrpita direct binding however model', 'different recognition specificity allele ptr ptra detects natural sequence variant effector confers pita resistance b allele ptr ptrb', 'one specific polymorphism effector sequence control escape ptrbmediated resistance', 'oryzae effector avrpita']}",1
22607456,Identification of positive and negative regulators of disease resistance to rice blast fungus using constitutive gene expression patterns.,"Elevated constitutive expression of components of the defence arsenal is associated with quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, a phenomenon called preformed defence. While the role of many disease regulators in inducible defence systems has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid so far to genes that regulate preformed defence. In this study, we show by microarray analysis across rice diversity that the preformed defence phenomenon impacts on a large number of defence-related genes without apparently affecting other biological processes. Using a guilt-by-association strategy, we identified two positive regulators that promote constitutive expression of known defence markers and partial resistance to rice blast. The HSF23 gene encodes for a putative member of the heat shock transcription factor family, while CaMBP encodes for a putative Calmodulin-binding protein. Both HSF23 and CaMBP strongly affect preformed defence and also plant growth. Additionally, we identified the OB-fold gene as a negative regulator of blast resistance, which could be involved in RNA stabilization. The OB-fold mutants do not suffer from obvious developmental defects.
