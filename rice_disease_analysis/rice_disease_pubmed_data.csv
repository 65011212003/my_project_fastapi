34769087,Recent Progress in Rice Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance.,"Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. However, stable rice production is constrained by various diseases, in particular rice blast, sheath blight, bacterial blight, and virus diseases. Breeding and cultivation of resistant rice varieties is the most effective method to control the infection of pathogens. Exploitation and utilization of the genetic determinants of broad-spectrum resistance represent a desired way to improve the resistance of susceptible rice varieties. Recently, researchers have focused on the identification of rice broad-spectrum disease resistance genes, which include <i>R</i> genes, defense-regulator genes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) against two or more pathogen species or many isolates of the same pathogen species. The cloning of broad-spectrum disease resistance genes and understanding their underlying mechanisms not only provide new genetic resources for breeding broad-spectrum rice varieties, but also promote the development of new disease resistance breeding strategies, such as editing susceptibility and executor <i>R</i> genes. In this review, the most recent advances in the identification of broad-spectrum disease resistance genes in rice and their application in crop improvement through biotechnology approaches during the past 10 years are summarized.",rice one important food crop world however stable rice production constrained various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance represent desired way improve resistance susceptible rice variety recently researcher focused identification rice broadspectrum disease resistance gene include iri gene defenseregulator gene quantitative trait locus qtl two pathogen specie many isolates pathogen specie cloning broadspectrum disease resistance gene understanding underlying mechanism provide new genetic resource breeding broadspectrum rice variety also promote development new disease resistance breeding strategy editing susceptibility executor iri gene review recent advance identification broadspectrum disease resistance gene rice application crop improvement biotechnology approach past year summarized,1,"{'Disease': ['resistance susceptible rice variety recently researcher focused identification rice broadspectrum disease resistance gene', 'many isolates pathogen specie cloning broadspectrum disease resistance gene', 'recent advance identification broadspectrum disease resistance gene rice application crop improvement biotechnology approach'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
23184051,Blast resistance in rice: a review of conventional breeding to molecular approaches.,"Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is the most severe diseases of rice. Using classical plant breeding techniques, breeders have developed a number of blast resistant cultivars adapted to different rice growing regions worldwide. However, the rice industry remains threatened by blast disease due to the instability of blast fungus. Recent advances in rice genomics provide additional tools for plant breeders to improve rice production systems that would be environmentally friendly. This article outlines the application of conventional breeding, tissue culture and DNA-based markers that are used for accelerating the development of blast resistant rice cultivars. The best way for controlling the disease is to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative genes in resistant variety. Through conventional and molecular breeding many blast-resistant varieties have been developed. Conventional breeding for disease resistance is tedious, time consuming and mostly dependent on environment as compare to molecular breeding particularly marker assisted selection, which is easier, highly efficient and precise. For effective management of blast disease, breeding work should be focused on utilizing the broad spectrum of resistance genes and pyramiding genes and quantitative trait loci. Marker assisted selection provides potential solution to some of the problems that conventional breeding cannot resolve. In recent years, blast resistant genes have introgressed into Luhui 17, G46B, Zhenshan 97B, Jin 23B, CO39, IR50, Pusa1602 and Pusa1603 lines through marker assisted selection. Introduction of exotic genes for resistance induced the occurrence of new races of blast fungus, therefore breeding work should be concentrated in local resistance genes. This review focuses on the conventional breeding to the latest molecular progress in blast disease resistance in rice.

38437153,Optimizing nutrient transporters to enhance disease resistance in rice.,"Fertilizers and plant diseases contribute positively and negatively to crop production, respectively. Macro- and micronutrients provided by the soil and fertilizers are transported by various plant nutrient transporters from the soil to the roots and shoots, facilitating growth and development. However, the homeostasis of different nutrients has different effects on plant disease. This review is aimed at providing insights into the interconnected regulation between nutrient homeostasis and immune responses, and it highlights strategies to enhance disease resistance by optimal manipulation of nutrient transporters in rice. First, we highlight the essential roles of six macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, calcium, magnesium) and eight micronutrients (iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, molybdenum, silicon, nickel), and summarize the diverse effects of each on rice diseases. We then systematically review the molecular mechanisms of immune responses modulated by nutrient transporters and the genetic regulatory pathways that control the specific nutrient-mediated immune signaling that is regulated by the pathogens and the host plant. Finally, we discuss putative strategies for breeding disease-resistant rice by genetic engineering of nutrient transporters.",fertilizer plant disease contribute positively negatively crop production respectively macro micronutrient provided soil fertilizer transported various plant nutrient transporter soil root shoot facilitating growth development however homeostasis different nutrient different effect plant disease review aimed providing insight interconnected regulation nutrient homeostasis immune response highlight strategy enhance disease resistance optimal manipulation nutrient transporter rice first highlight essential role six macronutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur calcium magnesium eight micronutrient iron manganese zinc copper boron molybdenum silicon nickel summarize diverse effect rice disease systematically review molecular mechanism immune response modulated nutrient transporter genetic regulatory pathway control specific nutrientmediated immune signaling regulated pathogen host plant finally discus putative strategy breeding diseaseresistant rice genetic engineering nutrient transporter,3,"{'Disease': ['fertilizer plant disease', 'different nutrient different effect plant disease review', 'nutrient homeostasis immune response highlight strategy enhance disease resistance optimal manipulation', 'diverse effect rice disease', 'diseaseresistant rice genetic engineering'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['different nutrient different effect plant disease review', 'diverse effect rice disease']}",3
29642631,Prospects of Understanding the Molecular Biology of Disease Resistance in Rice.,"Rice is one of the important crops grown worldwide and is considered as an important crop for global food security. Rice is being affected by various fungal, bacterial and viral diseases resulting in huge yield losses every year. Deployment of resistance genes in various crops is one of the important methods of disease management. However, identification, cloning and characterization of disease resistance genes is a very tedious effort. To increase the life span of resistant cultivars, it is important to understand the molecular basis of plant host-pathogen interaction. With the advancement in rice genetics and genomics, several rice varieties resistant to fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens have been developed. However, resistance response of these varieties break down very frequently because of the emergence of more virulent races of the pathogen in nature. To increase the durability of resistance genes under field conditions, understanding the mechanismof resistance response and its molecular basis should be well understood. Some emerging concepts like interspecies transfer of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and transgenerational plant immunitycan be employed to develop sustainable broad spectrum resistant varieties of rice.",rice one important crop grown worldwide considered important crop global food security rice affected various fungal bacterial viral disease resulting huge yield loss every year deployment resistance gene various crop one important method disease management however identification cloning characterization disease resistance gene tedious effort increase life span resistant cultivar important understand molecular basis plant hostpathogen interaction advancement rice genetics genomics several rice variety resistant fungal bacterial viral pathogen developed however resistance response variety break frequently emergence virulent race pathogen nature increase durability resistance gene field condition understanding mechanismof resistance response molecular basis well understood emerging concept like interspecies transfer pattern recognition receptor prrs transgenerational plant immunitycan employed develop sustainable broad spectrum resistant variety rice,1,"{'Disease': ['various fungal bacterial viral disease', 'one important method disease management', 'characterization disease resistance gene'], 'Treatment': ['one important method disease management'], 'Symptom': []}",1
37715970,Ustilaginoidea virens-secreted effector Uv1809 suppresses rice immunity by enhancing OsSRT2-mediated histone deacetylation.,"Rice false smut caused by Ustilaginoidea virens is a devastating rice (Oryza sativa) disease worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying U. virens-rice interactions are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a secreted protein, Uv1809, as a key virulence factor. Heterologous expression of Uv1809 in rice enhanced susceptibility to rice false smut and bacterial blight. Host-induced gene silencing of Uv1809 in rice enhanced resistance to U. virens, suggesting that Uv1809 inhibits rice immunity and promotes infection by U. virens. Uv1809 suppresses rice immunity by targeting and enhancing rice histone deacetylase OsSRT2-mediated histone deacetylation, thereby reducing H4K5ac and H4K8ac levels and interfering with the transcriptional activation of defence genes. CRISPR-Cas9 edited ossrt2 mutants showed no adverse effects in terms of growth and yield but displayed broad-spectrum resistance to rice pathogens, revealing a potentially valuable genetic resource for breeding disease resistance.

28410155,The puzzle of bakanae disease through interactions between Fusarium fujikuroi and rice.,"Bakanae disease, one of the most noteworthy seedborne rice diseases, is caused by Fusarium fujikuroi, a member of the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex. The decreasing availability of chemical seed-dressing products over the last few years has raised the concerns of rice seed companies regarding bakanae disease. Therefore, new research trends require a deeper investigation into the main aspects of bakanae disease through interactions between rice and F. fujikuroi, in order to find new resistant or tolerant cultivars and alternative bakanae disease control strategies, as well as to develop more sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques. Here, some new aspects of F. fujikuroi epidemiology and pathogenicity, as well as its interactions with rice, are reported, and recent approaches applied to control bakanae disease are summarized.",bakanae disease one noteworthy seedborne rice disease caused fusarium fujikuroi member gibberella fujikuroi specie complex decreasing availability chemical seeddressing product last year raised concern rice seed company regarding bakanae disease therefore new research trend require deeper investigation main aspect bakanae disease interaction rice f fujikuroi order find new resistant tolerant cultivar alternative bakanae disease control strategy well develop sensitive molecular diagnostic technique new aspect f fujikuroi epidemiology pathogenicity well interaction rice reported recent approach applied control bakanae disease summarized,2,"{'Disease': ['bakanae disease one noteworthy seedborne rice disease', 'bakanae disease', 'main aspect bakanae disease interaction rice f fujikuroi order', 'new resistant tolerant cultivar alternative bakanae disease control strategy', 'recent approach applied control bakanae disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
24658743,Disease resistance in rice and the role of molecular breeding in protecting rice crops against diseases.,"Rice diseases (bacterial, fungal, or viral) threaten food productivity. Host resistance is the most efficient, environmentally friendly method to cope with such diverse pathogens. Quantitative resistance conferred by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is a valuable resource for rice disease resistance improvement. Although QTLs confer partial but durable resistance to many pathogen species in different crop plants, the molecular mechanisms of quantitative disease resistance remain mostly unknown. Quantitative resistance and non-host resistance are types of broad-spectrum resistance, which are mediated by resistance (R) genes. Because R genes activate different resistance pathways, investigating the genetic spectrum of resistance may lead to minimal losses from harmful diseases. Genome studies can reveal interactions between different genes and their pathways and provide insight into gene functions. Protein–protein interaction (proteomics) studies using molecular and bioinformatics tools may further enlighten our understanding of resistance phenomena.",rice disease bacterial fungal viral threaten food productivity host resistance efficient environmentally friendly method cope diverse pathogen quantitative resistance conferred quantitative trait locus qtls valuable resource rice disease resistance improvement although qtls confer partial durable resistance many pathogen specie different crop plant molecular mechanism quantitative disease resistance remain mostly unknown quantitative resistance nonhost resistance type broadspectrum resistance mediated resistance r gene r gene activate different resistance pathway investigating genetic spectrum resistance may lead minimal loss harmful disease genome study reveal interaction different gene pathway provide insight gene function protein–protein interaction proteomics study using molecular bioinformatics tool may enlighten understanding resistance phenomenon,0,"{'Disease': ['rice disease bacterial fungal viral threaten food productivity host resistance', 'diverse pathogen quantitative resistance conferred quantitative trait locus qtls valuable resource rice disease resistance improvement', 'different crop plant molecular mechanism quantitative disease resistance', 'minimal loss harmful disease genome study'], 'Treatment': ['environmentally friendly method'], 'Symptom': []}",1
34890109,Engineering of rice varieties with enhanced resistances to both blast and bacterial blight diseases via CRISPR/Cas9.,"Rice blast and bacterial blight represent two of major diseases having devastating impact on the yield of rice in most rice-growing countries. Developments of resistant cultivars are the most economic and effective strategy to control these diseases. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to rapidly install mutations in three known broad-spectrum blast-resistant genes, Bsr-d1, Pi21 and ERF922, in an indica thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) rice line Longke638S (LK638S). We obtained transgene-free homozygous single or triple mutants in T<sub>1</sub> generations. While all single and triple mutants showed increased resistance to rice blast compared with wild type, the erf922 mutants displayed the strongest blast resistance similar with triple mutants. Surprisingly, we found that Pi21 or ERF922 single mutants conferred enhanced resistance to most of tested bacterial blight. Both resistances in mutants were attribute to the up-regulation of SA- and JA-pathway associated genes. Moreover, phenotypic analysis of these single mutants in paddy fields revealed that there were no trade-offs between resistances and main agricultural traits. Together, our study provides a rapid and effective way to generate rice varieties with resistance to both rice blast and bacterial blight.",rice blast bacterial blight represent two major disease devastating impact yield rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease used crisprcasmediated gene editing rapidly install mutation three known broadspectrum blastresistant gene bsrd pi erf indica thermosensitive genic male sterile tgms rice line longkes lks obtained transgenefree homozygous single triple mutant tsubsub generation single triple mutant showed increased resistance rice blast compared wild type erf mutant displayed strongest blast resistance similar triple mutant surprisingly found pi erf single mutant conferred enhanced resistance tested bacterial blight resistance mutant attribute upregulation sa japathway associated gene moreover phenotypic analysis single mutant paddy field revealed tradeoff resistance main agricultural trait together study provides rapid effective way generate rice variety resistance rice blast bacterial blight,1,"{'Disease': ['two major disease', 'rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['devastating impact', 'rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease', 'rapid effective way']}",1
39460780,Exploring the molecular mechanisms of rice blast resistance and advances in breeding for disease tolerance.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae), is a major problem in rice cultivation and ranks among the most severe fungal diseases. Cloning and identifying resistance genes in rice, coupled with a comprehensive examination of the interaction between M. oryzae and rice, may provide insights into the mechanisms of rice disease resistance and facilitate the creation of new rice varieties with improved germplasm. These efforts are essential for protecting food security. This review examines the discovery of genes that confer resistance or susceptiblity to M. oryzae in rice over the last decade. It also discusses how knowledge of molecular mechanisms has been used in rice breeding and outlines key strategies for creating rice varieties resistant to this disease. The strategies discussed include gene pyramiding, molecular design breeding, editing susceptibility genes, and increasing expression of resistance genes through pathogen challenge. We address the prospects and challenges in breeding for rice blast resistance, emphasizing the need to fully exploit germplasm resources, employ cutting-edge methods to identify new resistance genes, and develop innovative breeding cultivars. Additionally, we underscore the importance of understanding the molecular basis of rice blast resistance and developing novel cultivars with broad-spectrum disease resistance.",rice blast caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae syn pyricularia oryzae major problem rice cultivation rank among severe fungal disease cloning identifying resistance gene rice coupled comprehensive examination interaction oryzae rice may provide insight mechanism rice disease resistance facilitate creation new rice variety improved germplasm effort essential protecting food security review examines discovery gene confer resistance susceptiblity oryzae rice last decade also discusses knowledge molecular mechanism used rice breeding outline key strategy creating rice variety resistant disease strategy discussed include gene pyramiding molecular design breeding editing susceptibility gene increasing expression resistance gene pathogen challenge address prospect challenge breeding rice blast resistance emphasizing need fully exploit germplasm resource employ cuttingedge method identify new resistance gene develop innovative breeding cultivar additionally underscore importance understanding molecular basis rice blast resistance developing novel cultivar broadspectrum disease resistance,1,"{'Disease': ['fungus magnaporthe', 'severe fungal disease', 'insight mechanism rice disease resistance facilitate creation new rice variety', 'rice variety resistant disease strategy', 'molecular basis rice blast resistance developing novel cultivar broadspectrum disease resistance'], 'Treatment': ['fully exploit germplasm resource employ cuttingedge method'], 'Symptom': []}",1
39180629,Allelic variation in rice blast resistance: a pathway to sustainable disease management.,"Rice blast is a major problem in agriculture, affecting rice production and threatening food security worldwide. This disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, has led to a lot of research since the discovery of the first resistance gene, pib, in 1999. Researchers have now identified more than 50 resistance genes on eight of the twelve chromosomes in rice, each targeting different strains of the pathogen.These genes are spread out across seventeen different loci. These genes, which primarily code for nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins, play an important part in the defense of rice against the pathogen, either alone or in combination with other genes. An important characteristic of these genes is the allelic or paralogous interactions that exist within these loci. These relationships contribute to the gene's increased capacity for evolutionary adaptation. The ability of resistance proteins to recognize and react to novel effectors is improved by the frequent occurrence of variations within the domains that are responsible for recognizing pathogen effectors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the progress that has been made in identifying these essential genes and to investigate the possibility of utilizing the allelic variants obtained from these genes in future rice breeding efforts to increase resistance to rice blast.",rice blast major problem agriculture affecting rice production threatening food security worldwide disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae led lot research since discovery first resistance gene pib researcher identified resistance gene eight twelve chromosome rice targeting different strain pathogenthese gene spread across seventeen different locus gene primarily code nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat protein play important part defense rice pathogen either alone combination gene important characteristic gene allelic paralogous interaction exist within locus relationship contribute gene increased capacity evolutionary adaptation ability resistance protein recognize react novel effector improved frequent occurrence variation within domain responsible recognizing pathogen effector purpose review summarize progress made identifying essential gene investigate possibility utilizing allelic variant obtained gene future rice breeding effort increase resistance rice blast,4,"{'Disease': ['food security worldwide disease', 'fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['react novel effector', 'responsible recognizing pathogen effector purpose review']}",1

25394538,Molecular progress on the mapping and cloning of functional genes for blast disease in rice (Oryza sativa L.): current status and future considerations.,"Rice blast disease, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is a recurring problem in all rice-growing regions of the world. The use of resistance (R) genes in rice improvement breeding programmes has been considered to be one of the best options for crop protection and blast management. Alternatively, quantitative resistance conferred by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is also a valuable resource for the improvement of rice disease resistance. In the past, intensive efforts have been made to identify major R-genes as well as QTLs for blast disease using molecular techniques. A review of bibliographic references shows over 100 blast resistance genes and a larger number of QTLs (∼500) that were mapped to the rice genome. Of the blast resistance genes, identified in different genotypes of rice, ∼22 have been cloned and characterized at the molecular level. In this review, we have summarized the reported rice blast resistance genes and QTLs for utilization in future molecular breeding programmes to introgress high-degree resistance or to pyramid R-genes in commercial cultivars that are susceptible to M. oryzae.

30590260,The rice ethylene response factor OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel ethylene response factor (ERF) gene, OsERF83, which was expressed in rice leaves in response to rice blast fungus infection. OsERF83 expression was also induced by treatments with methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and salicylic acid, indicating that multiple phytohormones could be involved in the regulation of OsERF83 expression under biotic stress. Subcellular localization and transactivation analyses demonstrated that OsERF83 is a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator. A gel-shift assay using recombinant OsERF83 protein indicated that, like other ERFs, it binds to the GCC box. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsERF83 exhibited significantly suppressed lesion formation after rice blast infection, indicating that OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance in rice. Genes encoding several classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, including PR1, PR2, PR3, PR5, and PR10, were upregulated in the OsERF83ox plants.

38664971,"Recognition of the inducible, secretory small protein OsSSP1 by the membrane receptor OsSSR1 and the co-receptor OsBAK1 confers rice resistance to the blast fungus.","The plant apoplast, which serves as the frontline battleground for long-term host-pathogen interactions, harbors a wealth of disease resistance resources. However, the identification of the disease resistance proteins in the apoplast is relatively lacking. In this study, we identified and characterized the rice secretory protein OsSSP1 (Oryza sativa secretory small protein 1). OsSSP1 can be secreted into the plant apoplast, and either in vitro treatment of recombinant OsSSP1 or overexpression of OsSSP1 in rice could trigger plant immune response. The expression of OsSSP1 is suppressed significantly during Magnaporthe oryzae infection in the susceptible rice variety Taibei 309, and OsSSP1-overexpressing lines all show strong resistance to M. oryzae. Combining the knockout and overexpression results, we found that OsSSP1 positively regulates plant immunity in response to fungal infection. Moreover, the recognition and immune response triggered by OsSSP1 depend on an uncharacterized transmembrane OsSSR1 (secretory small protein receptor 1) and the key co-receptor OsBAK1, since most of the induced immune response and resistance are lost in the absence of OsSSR1 or OsBAK1. Intriguingly, the OsSSP1 protein is relatively stable and can still induce plant resistance after 1 week of storage in the open environment, and exogenous OsSSP1 treatment for a 2-week period did not affect rice yield. Collectively, our study reveals that OsSSP1 can be secreted into the apoplast and percepted by OsSSR1 and OsBAK1 during fungal infection, thereby triggering the immune response to enhance plant resistance to M. oryzae. These findings provide novel resources and potential strategies for crop breeding and disease control.",plant apoplast serf frontline battleground longterm hostpathogen interaction harbor wealth disease resistance resource however identification disease resistance protein apoplast relatively lacking study identified characterized rice secretory protein osssp oryza sativa secretory small protein osssp secreted plant apoplast either vitro treatment recombinant osssp overexpression osssp rice could trigger plant immune response expression osssp suppressed significantly magnaporthe oryzae infection susceptible rice variety taibei ossspoverexpressing line show strong resistance oryzae combining knockout overexpression result found osssp positively regulates plant immunity response fungal infection moreover recognition immune response triggered osssp depend uncharacterized transmembrane osssr secretory small protein receptor key coreceptor osbak since induced immune response resistance lost absence osssr osbak intriguingly osssp protein relatively stable still induce plant resistance week storage open environment exogenous osssp treatment week period affect rice yield collectively study reveals osssp secreted apoplast percepted osssr osbak fungal infection thereby triggering immune response enhance plant resistance oryzae finding provide novel resource potential strategy crop breeding disease control,2,"{'Disease': ['novel resource potential strategy crop breeding disease control'], 'Treatment': ['either vitro treatment recombinant osssp overexpression osssp rice'], 'Symptom': []}",2

In the present study, fenugreek seed extracts radiated with different doses of gamma rays viz. 5Gy, 10Gy, 15Gy, 20Gy and 25Gy were examined for their presence of biocompounds as well as for its ability to induce plant growth promotion and resistance against rice blast disease. The results of GC-MS analysis detected antimicrobial properties in methanolic extract. Enhanced germination (97%) and vigor (2718) was noticed in seeds pretreated with 20 Gy of gamma radiation in comparison with non-irradiated controls. Under greenhouse conditions, a significant disease protection of 56.7% on 3rd and 4th day after inoculation against rice blast was observed in 15Gy-irradiated rice plants challenge-inoculated with M. oryzae. Further, a significant increase in the hydrogen peroxide, phenol and lignin deposition was noticed in 20Gy-irradiated rice plants. Additionally, rice plants pretreated with 15Gy induced maximum activities of peroxidase (POX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) compared to untreated control plants.

37343319,bZIP23 interacts with NAC028 to modulate rice resistance to sheath blight disease.,"Rice sheath blight disease (ShB) is a serious threat to rice production, and breeding ShB-resistance varieties is the most effective strategy for ShB control. However, the molecular mechanisms of rice resistance to ShB are largely unknown. In this study, the NAC transcription factor NAC028 was shown to be sensitive to ShB infection. ShB inoculation assays revealed that NAC028 is a positive regulator of ShB resistance. To elucidate the molecular basis of NAC028-mediated ShB resistance, another transcription factor (bZIP23) was identified as a NAC028-interacting protein. Results of the transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that CAD8B, a key enzyme for lignin biosynthesis and ShB resistance, is regulated by both bZIP23 and NAC028.

34058471,CBL-interacting protein kinase 31 regulates rice resistance to blast disease by modulating cellular potassium levels.,"Rice blast disease caused by infection with Magnaporthe oryzae, a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen, significantly reduces the yield production. However, the rice defense mechanism against blast disease remains elusive. To identify the genes involved in the regulation of rice defense to blast disease, dissociation (Ds) transposon tagging mutant lines were analyzed in terms of their response to M. oryzae isolate Guy11. Among them, CBL-interactingprotein kinase31 (CIPK31) mutants were more susceptible than wild-type plants to blast. The CIPK31 transcript was found to be insensitive to Guy11 infection, and the CIPK31-GFP was localized to the cytosol and nucleus. Overexpression of CIPK31 promoted rice defense to blast. Further analysis indicated that CIPK31 interacts with Calcineurin B-like 2 (CBL2) and CBL6 at the plasma membrane, and cbl2 mutants are more susceptible to blast compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that calcium signaling might partially through the CBL2-CIPK31 signaling regulate rice defense. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that AKT1-like (AKT1L), a potential potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel protein, interacted with CIPK31, and the K<sup>+</sup> level was significantly lower in the cipk31 mutants than in the wild-type control. In addition, exogenous potassium application increased rice resistance to blast, suggesting that CIPK31 might interact with AKT1L to increase K<sup>+</sup> uptake, thereby promoting resistance to blast. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that CBL2-CIPK31-AKT1L is a new signaling pathway that regulates rice defense to blast disease.",rice blast disease caused infection magnaporthe oryzae hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen significantly reduces yield production however rice defense mechanism blast disease remains elusive identify gene involved regulation rice defense blast disease dissociation d transposon tagging mutant line analyzed term response oryzae isolate guy among cblinteractingprotein kinase cipk mutant susceptible wildtype plant blast cipk transcript found insensitive guy infection cipkgfp localized cytosol nucleus overexpression cipk promoted rice defense blast analysis indicated cipk interacts calcineurin blike cbl cbl plasma membrane cbl mutant susceptible blast compared wildtype plant suggesting calcium signaling might partially cblcipk signaling regulate rice defense yeast twohybrid result showed aktlike aktl potential potassium ksupsup channel protein interacted cipk ksupsup level significantly lower cipk mutant wildtype control addition exogenous potassium application increased rice resistance blast suggesting cipk might interact aktl increase ksupsup uptake thereby promoting resistance blast taken together result presented demonstrate cblcipkaktl new signaling pathway regulates rice defense blast disease,2,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'rice defense mechanism blast disease', 'regulation rice defense blast disease dissociation', 'rice defense blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3

In the present study transcriptomic analysis was conducted between two contrasting resistant (C101A51) and susceptible (Rasi) genotypes of rice with the combinations of C101A51 control (CC) vs. C101A51 inoculated (CI); Rasi control (RC) vs. Rasi inoculated (RI) and C101A51 inoculated (CI) vs. Rasi inoculated (RI). In CC vs. CI commonly expressed genes were 12,764. Out of them 567 (4%) were significantly upregulated and 1399 (9%) genes were downregulated. For the RC vs. RI 14, 333 (79%) genes were commonly expressed. For CI vs. RI 13,662 (72%) genes were commonly expressed.

To dissect the molecular events responsible for RTD-induced stunting, the expression patterns of 23 cell-wall-related genes were examined in different rice lines with the same titers of RTSV but different titers of RTBV and in lines where only RTBV was present. Genes encoding cellulose synthases, expansins, glycosyl hydrolases, exostosins, and xyloglucan galactosyl transferase showed downregulation, whereas those encoding defensin or defensin-like proteins showed upregulation with increasing titers of RTBV. RTSV titers did not affect the expression levels of these genes. A similar relationship was seen for the reduction in the cellulose and pectin content and the accumulation of lignin. In silico analysis of promoters of the genes indicated a possible link to transcription factors reported earlier to respond to viral titers in rice.

Here, we extensively review approximately 70 publications and gather together information on more than 2,500 genes of the rice defense arsenal. This information was integrated into the OryGenesDB database. Several genes (e.g., metallothioneins and PBZ1) appear to be hallmarks of rice-pathogen interactions. Cross-referencing this information with the rice kinome highlighted some defense genes and kinases as possible central nodes of regulation. Cross referencing defense gene expression and quantitative trait loci (QTL) information identified some candidate genes for QTL. Overall, pathogenesis-related genes and disease regulators were found to be statistically associated with disease QTL. At the genomic level, we observed that some regions are richer than others and that some chromosomes (e.g., 11 and 12), which contain a lot of resistance gene analogs, have a low content of defense genes. Finally, we show that classical defense genes and defense-related genes such as resistance genes are preferentially organized in clusters. These clusters are not always coregulated and individual paralogs can show specific expression patterns. Thus, the rice defense arsenal has an ARCHIPELAGO-like genome structure at the macro and micro level.

34038435,Understanding the complexity of disease-climate interactions for rice bacterial panicle blight under tropical conditions.,"Bacterial panicle blight (BPB) caused by Burkholderia glumae is one of the main concerns for rice production in the Americas since bacterial infection can interfere with the grain-filling process and under severe conditions can result in high sterility. B. glumae has been detected in several rice-growing areas of Colombia and other countries of Central and Andean regions in Latin America, although evidence of its involvement in decreasing yield under these conditions is lacking. Analysis of different parameters in trials established in three rice-growing areas showed that, despite BPB presence, severity did not explain the sterility observed in fields. PCR tests for B. glumae confirmed low infection in all sites and genotypes, only 21.4% of the analyzed samples were positive for B. glumae. Climate parameters showed that Montería and Saldaña registered maximum temperature above 34°C, minimum temperature above 23°C, and Relative Humidity above 80%, conditions that favor the invasion model described for this pathogen in Asia. Our study found that in Colombia, minimum temperature above 23°C during 10 days after flowering is the condition that correlates with disease incidence. Therefore, this correlation, and the fact that Montería and Saldaña had a higher level of infected samples according to PCR tests, high minimum temperature, but not maximum temperature, seems to be determinant for B. glumae colonization under studied field conditions. This knowledge is a solid base line to design strategies for disease control, and is also a key element for breeders to develop strategies aimed to decrease the effect of B. glumae and high night-temperature on rice yield under tropical conditions.",bacterial panicle blight bpb caused burkholderia glumae one main concern rice production america since bacterial infection interfere grainfilling process severe condition result high sterility b glumae detected several ricegrowing area colombia country central andean region latin america although evidence involvement decreasing yield condition lacking analysis different parameter trial established three ricegrowing area showed despite bpb presence severity explain sterility observed field pcr test b glumae confirmed low infection site genotype analyzed sample positive b glumae climate parameter showed montería saldaña registered maximum temperature °c minimum temperature °c relative humidity condition favor invasion model described pathogen asia study found colombia minimum temperature °c day flowering condition correlate disease incidence therefore correlation fact montería saldaña higher level infected sample according pcr test high minimum temperature maximum temperature seems determinant b glumae colonization studied field condition knowledge solid base line design strategy disease control also key element breeder develop strategy aimed decrease effect b glumae high nighttemperature rice yield tropical condition,2,"{'Disease': ['disease incidence'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
39146939,Extensive immune receptor repertoire diversity in disease-resistant rice landraces.,"Plants have powerful defense mechanisms and extensive immune receptor repertoires, yet crop monocultures are prone to epidemic diseases. Rice (Oryza sativa) is susceptible to many diseases, such as rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Varietal resistance of rice to blast relies on intracellular nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that recognize specific pathogen molecules and trigger immune responses. In the Yuanyang terraces in southwest China, rice landraces rarely show severe losses to disease whereas commercial inbred lines show pronounced field susceptibility. Here, we investigate within-landrace NLR sequence diversity of nine rice landraces and eleven modern varieties using complexity reduction techniques. We find that NLRs display high sequence diversity in landraces, consistent with balancing selection, and that balancing selection at NLRs is more pervasive in landraces than modern varieties. Notably, modern varieties lack many ancient NLR haplotypes that are retained in some landraces. Our study emphasizes the value of standing genetic variation that is maintained in farmer landraces as a resource to make modern crops and agroecosystems less prone to disease. The conservation of landraces is, therefore, crucial for ensuring food security in the face of dynamic biotic and abiotic threats.",plant powerful defense mechanism extensive immune receptor repertoire yet crop monoculture prone epidemic disease rice oryza sativa susceptible many disease rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae varietal resistance rice blast relies intracellular nucleotide binding leucinerich repeat nlr receptor recognize specific pathogen molecule trigger immune response yuanyang terrace southwest china rice landraces rarely show severe loss disease whereas commercial inbred line show pronounced field susceptibility investigate withinlandrace nlr sequence diversity nine rice landraces eleven modern variety using complexity reduction technique find nlrs display high sequence diversity landraces consistent balancing selection balancing selection nlrs pervasive landraces modern variety notably modern variety lack many ancient nlr haplotype retained landraces study emphasizes value standing genetic variation maintained farmer landraces resource make modern crop agroecosystems less prone disease conservation landraces therefore crucial ensuring food security face dynamic biotic abiotic threat,4,"{'Disease': ['crop monoculture prone epidemic disease rice oryza sativa', 'severe loss disease', 'less prone disease conservation landraces'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

Unhealthy rice seeds with DPD are potent reservoirs of pathogens and unable to be used as seed stock as they can spread the disease in the paddy fields leading to the severe loss of rice yield and quality. In this study, we aim to search for beneficial endophytes of commercially cultivated rice plants and utilize them as biostimulants in seed biopriming for fertility recovery and disease suppression of unhealthy rice seeds. Forty-three bacterial endophytes were isolated from rice plants grown in the herbicide-treated paddy fields. Five isolates of these endophytes belonging to the genus Bacillus show excellent antifungal activity against fungal pathogens of DPD. Based on germination tests, biopriming unhealthy rice seeds by soaking in bacterial suspensions for 9 or 12 h was optimal as evidenced by the lowest disease incidence and longer shoot and root lengths of seedlings germinated, compared with controls made of non-treated or hydroprimed healthy and unhealthy seeds. Pot experiments were carried out to evaluate the impact of seed biopriming, in which the percentage of healthy rice yield produced by rice plants emerging from bioprimed seeds was not significantly different, compared to the controls originating respectively from non-treated healthy seeds and chemical fungicide-treated unhealthy seeds. Biopriming of unhealthy rice seeds with herbicide-tolerant endophytic bacteria could recover seed fertility and protect the full life cycle of emerging rice plants from fungal pests. With our findings, seed biopriming is a straightforward approach that farmers can apply to recover unhealthy rice seed stock, which enables them to reduce the cost and use of agrochemicals in the commercial production of rice and to promote green technology in sustainable agriculture.",dirty panicle disease dpd caused several fungal phytopathogens result damage depreciation rice seed unhealthy rice seed dpd potent reservoir pathogen unable used seed stock spread disease paddy field leading severe loss rice yield quality study aim search beneficial endophytes commercially cultivated rice plant utilize biostimulants seed biopriming fertility recovery disease suppression unhealthy rice seed fortythree bacterial endophytes isolated rice plant grown herbicidetreated paddy field five isolates endophytes belonging genus bacillus show excellent antifungal activity fungal pathogen dpd based germination test biopriming unhealthy rice seed soaking bacterial suspension h optimal evidenced lowest disease incidence longer shoot root length seedling germinated compared control made nontreated hydroprimed healthy unhealthy seed pot experiment carried evaluate impact seed biopriming percentage healthy rice yield produced rice plant emerging bioprimed seed significantly different compared control originating respectively nontreated healthy seed chemical fungicidetreated unhealthy seed biopriming unhealthy rice seed herbicidetolerant endophytic bacteria could recover seed fertility protect full life cycle emerging rice plant fungal pest finding seed biopriming straightforward approach farmer apply recover unhealthy rice seed stock enables reduce cost use agrochemicals commercial production rice promote green technology sustainable agriculture,2,"{'Disease': ['dirty panicle disease dpd', 'fertility recovery disease suppression', 'lowest disease incidence'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['impact seed']}",2

Breeders have played a major role in developing resistant rice varieties against the BLB infection which has been adjudged to be a major disease causing significant yield reduction in rice. It would be difficult to select rice crops with multiple genes of resistance using the conventional approach alone. This is due to masking effect of genes including epistasis. In addition, conventional breeding takes a lot of time before a gene of interest can be introgressed. Linkage drag is also a major challenge in conventional approach. Molecular breeding involving markers has facilitated the characterization and introgression of BLB disease resistance genes.

Considering the strong antifungal activity of biosynthesized AgNPs (as reported in our previous study), our main aim is to elucidate their antibacterial activity against bacterial plant pathogens to authenticate their wide range of agricultural applications. The present manuscript highlights the potential role of biosynthesized AgNPs against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) causing disastrous sheath blight disease of rice worldwide. We observed strong antibacterial activity of biosynthesized AgNPs (size ~ 12 nm) against Xoo at 20, 30 and 50 µg/mL concentrations. The significant inhibitory impact of AgNPs on biofilm formation by Xoo was noted even at the lower dose of 5 µg/mL (p = 0.001). Maximum biofilm inhibition (p = 0.000) was caused at 50 µg/mL concentration of AgNPs in comparison to control. Furthermore, disease suppression by biosynthesized AgNPs was authenticated under greenhouse conditions. Foliar spray of AgNPs significantly reduced the blight symptoms in rice sheaths as shown by 9.25% DLA (% Diseased leaf area) as compared to 33.91% DLA in Xoo inoculated rice plants. Altogether, our data suggest that biosynthesized AgNPs based nanoformulation can be applied for successful management of blight disease of rice.

Several defense response genes have been successfully used as good predictors and contributors to QTL-based resistance against several devastating rice diseases. In this study, we identified and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant line containing a 750 bp deletion in the second exon of OsPAL4, a member of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene family. OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2. Self-pollination of heterozygous ospal4 mutant lines produced no homozygous progeny, suggesting that homozygosity for the mutation is lethal. The heterozygous ospal4 mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility to three distinct rice diseases, bacterial blight, sheath blight, and rice blast. Mutation of OsPAL4 increased expression of the OsPAL2 gene and decreased the expression of the unlinked OsPAL6 gene. OsPAL2 function is not redundant because the changes in expression did not compensate for loss of disease resistance. OsPAL6 co-localizes with a QTL for rice blast resistance, and is down-regulated in the ospal4 mutant line; this may explain enhanced susceptibility to Magnoporthe oryzae. Overall, these results suggest that OsPAL4 and possibly OsPAL6 are key contributors to resistance governed by QTL and are potential breeding targets for improved broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.",agronomically important trait including resistance pathogen governed quantitative trait locus qtl qtlmediated resistance show promise effective longlasting diverse pathogen identification gene controlling qtlbased disease resistance contributes breeding cultivar exhibit high stable resistance several defense response gene successfully used good predictor contributor qtlbased resistance several devastating rice disease study identified characterized rice oryza sativa mutant line containing bp deletion second exon ospal member phenylalanine ammonialyase gene family ospal cluster three additional ospal gene colocalize qtl bacterial blight sheath blight disease resistance rice chromosome selfpollination heterozygous ospal mutant line produced homozygous progeny suggesting homozygosity mutation lethal heterozygous ospal mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility three distinct rice disease bacterial blight sheath blight rice blast mutation ospal increased expression ospal gene decreased expression unlinked ospal gene ospal function redundant change expression compensate loss disease resistance ospal colocalizes qtl rice blast resistance downregulated ospal mutant line may explain enhanced susceptibility magnoporthe oryzae overall result suggest ospal possibly ospal key contributor resistance governed qtl potential breeding target improved broadspectrum disease resistance rice,0,"{'Disease': ['qtlbased disease resistance', 'several devastating rice disease study', 'increased susceptibility three distinct rice disease bacterial blight sheath blight rice blast mutation ospal increased expression ospal gene', 'loss disease resistance ospal'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective longlasting diverse pathogen identification gene']}",4
36245122,"Overproduction of OsRACK1A, an effector-targeted scaffold protein promoting OsRBOHB-mediated ROS production, confers rice floral resistance to false smut disease without yield penalty.","Grain formation is fundamental for crop yield but is vulnerable to abiotic and biotic stresses. Rice grain production is threatened by the false smut fungus Ustilaginoidea virens, which specifically infects rice floral organs, disrupting fertilization and seed formation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the U. virens-rice interaction and the genetic basis of floral resistance. Here, we report that U. virens secretes a cytoplasmic effector, UvCBP1, to facilitate infection of rice flowers. Mechanistically, UvCBP1 interacts with the rice scaffold protein OsRACK1A and competes its interaction with the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase OsRBOHB, leading to inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Although the analysis of natural variation revealed no OsRACK1A variants that could avoid being targeted by UvCBP1, expression levels of OsRACK1A are correlated with field resistance against U. virens in rice germplasm. Overproduction of OsRACK1A restores the OsRACK1A-OsRBOHB association and promotes OsRBOHB phosphorylation to enhance ROS production, conferring rice floral resistance to U. virens without yield penalty. Taken together, our findings reveal a new pathogenic mechanism mediated by an essential effector from a flower-specific pathogen and provide a valuable genetic resource for balancing disease resistance and crop yield.",grain formation fundamental crop yield vulnerable abiotic biotic stress rice grain production threatened false smut fungus ustilaginoidea virens specifically infects rice floral organ disrupting fertilization seed formation however little known molecular mechanism u virensrice interaction genetic basis floral resistance report u virens secretes cytoplasmic effector uvcbp facilitate infection rice flower mechanistically uvcbp interacts rice scaffold protein osracka competes interaction reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase osrbohb leading inhibition reactive oxygen specie ro production although analysis natural variation revealed osracka variant could avoid targeted uvcbp expression level osracka correlated field resistance u virens rice germplasm overproduction osracka restores osrackaosrbohb association promotes osrbohb phosphorylation enhance ro production conferring rice floral resistance u virens without yield penalty taken together finding reveal new pathogenic mechanism mediated essential effector flowerspecific pathogen provide valuable genetic resource balancing disease resistance crop yield,2,"{'Disease': ['false smut fungus ustilaginoidea', 'valuable genetic resource balancing disease resistance crop yield'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['cytoplasmic effector uvcbp facilitate infection rice flower', 'reveal new pathogenic mechanism mediated essential effector flowerspecific pathogen']}",0
24214893,Interaction between Rice stripe virus disease-specific protein and host PsbP enhances virus symptoms.,"Rice stripe virus (RSV) causes severe diseases in Oryza sativa (rice) in many Eastern Asian countries. Disease-specific protein (SP) of RSV is a non-structural protein and its accumulation level in rice plant was shown to determine the severity of RSV symptoms. Here, we present evidence that expression of RSV SP alone in rice or Nicotiana benthamiana did not produce visible symptoms. Expression of SP in these two plants, however, enhanced RSV- or Potato virus X (PVX)-induced symptoms. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, GST pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we demonstrated that RSV SP interacted with PsbP, a 23-kDa oxygen-evolving complex protein, in both rice and N. benthamiana. Furthermore, our investigation showed that silencing of PsbP expression in both plants increased disease symptom severity and virus accumulation. Confocal microscopy using N. benthamiana protoplast showed that PsbP accumulated predominantly in chloroplast in wild-type N. benthamiana cells. In the presence of RSV SP, most PsbP was recruited into cytoplasm of the assayed cells. In addition, accumulation of SP during RSV infection resulted in alterations of chloroplast structure and function.

26363817,Rice Responses and Resistance to Planthopper-Borne Viruses at Transcriptomic and Proteomic Levels.,"Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important cereal crops in the world, especially in Asian areas. Rice virus diseases are considered as the most serious threat to rice yields. Most rice viruses are transmitted by hemipteran insects such as planthoppers and leafhoppers. In Asia five rice viruses are transmitted mainly by three planthopper species in a persistent manner: Rice stripe virus, Rice black-streaked dwarf virus, Rice ragged stunt virus, Rice grassy stunt virus, and Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus. In rice antivirus studies, several individual genes have been shown to function in rice resistance to viruses. Since plant responses to viral infection are complex, system-level omic studies are required to fully understand the responses. Recently more and more omic studies have appeared in the literatures on relationships between planthoppers and viruses, employing microarray, RNA-Seq, small RNA deep sequencing, degradome sequencing, and proteomic analysis. In this paper, we review the current knowledge and progress of omic studies in rice plant responses and resistance to four planthopper-borned viruses. We also discuss progress in the omic study of the interactions of planthoppers and rice viruses.

In the present study, a subset of a United States Department of Agriculture rice core collection consisting of 151 accessions was selected using a major blast resistance (R) gene, Pi-ta, marker and was genotyped with 156 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Disease reactions to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, were evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions, and heading date, plant height, paddy and brown seed weight in two field environments were analyzed, using an association mapping approach. A total of 21 SSR markers distributed among rice chromosomes 2 to 12 were associated with blast resistance, and 16 SSR markers were associated with seed weight, heading date, and plant height. Most noticeably, shorter plants were significantly correlated with resistance to blast, rice genomes with Pi-ta were associated with lighter seed weights, and the susceptible alleles of RM171 and RM6544 were associated with heavier seed weight.

38732268,OsCAMTA3 Negatively Regulates Disease Resistance to <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> by Associating with OsCAMTAPL in Rice.,"Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is one of the most important staple foods worldwide. However, rice blast disease, caused by the ascomycete fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, seriously affects the yield and quality of rice. Calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators (CAMTAs) play vital roles in the response to biotic stresses. In this study, we showed that OsCAMTA3 and CAMTA PROTEIN LIKE (OsCAMTAPL), an OsCAMTA3 homolog that lacks the DNA-binding domain, functioned together in negatively regulating disease resistance in rice. OsCAMTA3 associated with OsCAMTAPL. The <i>oscamta3</i> and <i>oscamtapl</i> mutants showed enhanced resistance compared to wild-type plants, and <i>oscamta3/pl</i> double mutants showed more robust resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i> than <i>oscamta3</i> or <i>oscamtapl</i>. An RNA-Seq analysis revealed that 59 and 73 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed in wild-type plants and <i>oscamta3</i> before and after inoculation with <i>M. oryzae</i>, including <i>OsALDH2B1</i>, an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase that negatively regulates plant immunity. OsCAMTA3 could directly bind to the promoter of <i>OsALDH2B1</i>, and <i>OsALDH2B1</i> expression was decreased in <i>oscamta3</i>, <i>oscamtapl</i>, and <i>oscamta3/pl</i> mutants. In conclusion, OsCAMTA3 associates with OsCAMTAPL to regulate disease resistance by binding and activating the expression of <i>OsALDH2B1</i> in rice, which reveals a strategy by which rice controls rice blast disease and provides important genes for resistance breeding holding a certain positive impact on ensuring food security.",rice ioryza sativai one important staple food worldwide however rice blast disease caused ascomycete fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei seriously affect yield quality rice calmodulinbinding transcriptional activator camtas play vital role response biotic stress study showed oscamta camta protein like oscamtapl oscamta homolog lack dnabinding domain functioned together negatively regulating disease resistance rice oscamta associated oscamtapl ioscamtai ioscamtapli mutant showed enhanced resistance compared wildtype plant ioscamtapli double mutant showed robust resistance im oryzaei ioscamtai ioscamtapli rnaseq analysis revealed gene respectively differentially expressed wildtype plant ioscamtai inoculation im oryzaei including iosaldhbi acetaldehyde dehydrogenase negatively regulates plant immunity oscamta could directly bind promoter iosaldhbi iosaldhbi expression decreased ioscamtai ioscamtapli ioscamtapli mutant conclusion oscamta associate oscamtapl regulate disease resistance binding activating expression iosaldhbi rice reveals strategy rice control rice blast disease provides important gene resistance breeding holding certain positive impact ensuring food security,2,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'ascomycete fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei', 'disease resistance rice', 'strategy rice control rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['certain positive impact']}",1

To elucidate the mechanism underlying this MoHrip2 elicitation in rice, we used differential-display 2-D gel electrophoresis and qRT-PCR to assess the differential expression among the total proteins extracted from rice leaves at 24 h after treatment with MoHrip2 and buffer as a control. Among ~1000 protein spots detected on each gel, 10 proteins were newly induced, 4 were up-regulated, and 3 were down-regulated in MoHrip2-treated samples compared with the buffer control. Seventeen differentially expressed proteins were detected using MS/MS analysis and categorized into six groups according to their putative function: defense-related transcriptional factors, signal transduction-related proteins, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, programmed cell death (PCD), defense-related proteins, and photosynthesis and energy-related proteins. The qPCR results (relative expression level of genes) further supported the differential expression of proteins in MoHrip2-treated rice leaves identified with 2D-gel, suggesting that MoHrip2 triggers an early defense response in rice leaves via stress-related pathways, and the results provide evidence for elicitor-induced resistance at the protein level.",mohrip magnaporthe oryzae hypersensitive protein elicitor protein rice blast fungus oryzae rice seedling treated mohrip shown induced resistance rice blast elucidate mechanism underlying mohrip elicitation rice used differentialdisplay gel electrophoresis qrtpcr assess differential expression among total protein extracted rice leaf h treatment mohrip buffer control among protein spot detected gel protein newly induced upregulated downregulated mohriptreated sample compared buffer control seventeen differentially expressed protein detected using msms analysis categorized six group according putative function defenserelated transcriptional factor signal transductionrelated protein reactive oxygen specie ro production programmed cell death pcd defenserelated protein photosynthesis energyrelated protein qpcr result relative expression level gene supported differential expression protein mohriptreated rice leaf identified dgel suggesting mohrip trigger early defense response rice leaf via stressrelated pathway result provide evidence elicitorinduced resistance protein level,2,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae hypersensitive protein elicitor protein rice blast fungus oryzae rice seedling treated mohrip'], 'Treatment': ['rice leaf h treatment mohrip buffer control'], 'Symptom': []}",4

The current blast management options such as blast-resistant varieties and spraying fungicides are neither durable nor commercially and environmentally compatible. In the present study, we investigated the antifungal and defense elicitor activity of potassium phosphite (Phi) against M. oryzae on elite rice cultivar BPT5204 (popularly known as Samba Mahsuri in India) and its transgenic rice variant (ptxD-OE) over-expressing a phosphite dehydrogenase enzyme. The Phi was evaluated both preventively and curatively on rice genotypes where the preventive spray of Phi outperformed the Phi curative application with significant reductions in both rice blast severity (35.67-60.49%) and incidence (22.27-53.25%). Moreover, the application of Phi increased the levels of photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll and Carotenoids) coupled with increased activity of defense enzymes (PAL, SOD, and APx). Besides, Phi application also induced the expression of defense-associated genes (OsCEBiP and OsPDF2.2) in the rice leaf. Furthermore, the Phi application reduced the reactive Malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation) to minimize the cellular damage incited by Magnaporthe in rice.

U.S. weedy rice is well adapted to the local conditions in U.S. rice fields. Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of cultivated rice worldwide. However, information about resistance to blast in weedy rice is limited. Here, we evaluated the disease reactions of 60 U.S. weedy rice accessions with 14 blast races, and investigated the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with blast resistance in two major ecotypes of U.S. weedy rice. Our results revealed that U.S. weedy rice exhibited a broad resistance spectrum. Using genotyping by sequencing, we identified 28 resistance QTL in two U.S. weedy rice ecotypes. The resistance QTL with relatively large and small effects suggest that U.S. weedy rice groups have adapted to blast disease using two methods, both major resistance (R) genes and QTL. Three genomic loci shared by some of the resistance QTL indicated that these loci may contribute to no-race-specific resistance in weedy rice. Comparing with known blast disease R genes, we found that the R genes at these resistance QTL are novel, suggesting that U.S. weedy rice is a potential source of novel blast R genes for resistant breeding.",understanding genetic architecture adaptation great importance evolutionary biology u weedy rice well adapted local condition u rice field rice blast disease one destructive disease cultivated rice worldwide however information resistance blast weedy rice limited evaluated disease reaction u weedy rice accession blast race investigated quantitative trait locus qtl associated blast resistance two major ecotypes u weedy rice result revealed u weedy rice exhibited broad resistance spectrum using genotyping sequencing identified resistance qtl two u weedy rice ecotypes resistance qtl relatively large small effect suggest u weedy rice group adapted blast disease using two method major resistance r gene qtl three genomic locus shared resistance qtl indicated locus may contribute noracespecific resistance weedy rice comparing known blast disease r gene found r gene resistance qtl novel suggesting u weedy rice potential source novel blast r gene resistant breeding,0,"{'Disease': ['local condition u rice field rice blast disease one destructive disease', 'information resistance blast weedy rice limited evaluated disease reaction u weedy rice accession blast race', 'blast disease', 'known blast disease r gene'], 'Treatment': ['two method major resistance r gene'], 'Symptom': ['relatively large small effect']}",2

Control plots of monocultured crops allowed us to calculate the effect of diversity on the severity of rice blast, the major disease of rice. Disease-susceptible rice varieties planted in mixtures with resistant varieties had 89% greater yield and blast was 94% less severe than when they were grown in monoculture. The experiment was so successful that fungicidal sprays were no longer applied by the end of the two-year programme.

31698708,Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance Conferred by the Overexpression of Rice RLCK BSR1 Results from an Enhanced Immune Response to Multiple MAMPs.,"Plants activate their immune system through intracellular signaling pathways after perceiving microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases mediate the intracellular signaling downstream of pattern-recognition receptors. BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1 (BSR1), a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily-VII protein, contributes to chitin-triggered immune responses. It is valuable for agriculture because its overexpression confers strong disease resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. However, it remains unclear how overexpressed BSR1 reinforces plant immunity. Here we analyzed immune responses using rice suspension-cultured cells and sliced leaf blades overexpressing BSR1. BSR1 overexpression enhances MAMP-triggered production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and transcriptional activation of the defense-related gene in cultured cells and leaf strips. Furthermore, the co-cultivation of leaves with conidia of the blast fungus revealed that BSR1 overexpression allowed host plants to produce detectable oxidative bursts against compatible pathogens. BSR1 was also involved in the immune responses triggered by peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide. Thus, we concluded that the hyperactivation of MAMP-triggered immune responses confers BSR1-mediated robust resistance to broad-spectrum pathogens.",plant activate immune system intracellular signaling pathway perceiving microbeassociated molecular pattern mamps receptorlike cytoplasmic kinase mediate intracellular signaling downstream patternrecognition receptor broadspectrum resistance bsr rice ioryza sativai receptorlike cytoplasmic kinase subfamilyvii protein contributes chitintriggered immune response valuable agriculture overexpression confers strong disease resistance fungal bacterial pathogen however remains unclear overexpressed bsr reinforces plant immunity analyzed immune response using rice suspensioncultured cell sliced leaf blade overexpressing bsr bsr overexpression enhances mamptriggered production hydrogen peroxide hsubsubosubsub transcriptional activation defenserelated gene cultured cell leaf strip furthermore cocultivation leaf conidium blast fungus revealed bsr overexpression allowed host plant produce detectable oxidative burst compatible pathogen bsr also involved immune response triggered peptidoglycan lipopolysaccharide thus concluded hyperactivation mamptriggered immune response confers bsrmediated robust resistance broadspectrum pathogen,4,"{'Disease': ['strong disease resistance fungal bacterial pathogen', 'furthermore cocultivation leaf conidium blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

Triggering a fast and strong immune response to pathogens, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) has intrigued scientists to intensively study and utilize the mechanisms for engineering highly resistant plants. The conservation of ETI components and mechanisms across species enables the use of ETI components to generate broad-spectrum resistance in plants. Numerous efforts have been made to introduce new resistance (R) genes, widen the effector recognition spectrum and generate on-demand R genes. Although engineering ETI across plant species is still associated with multiple challenges, previous attempts have provided an enhanced understanding of ETI mechanisms. Here, we provide a survey of recent reports in the engineering of rice R genes.

Rice As speciation is dominated by iAs and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Here we review the global pattern in rice As speciation and the factors causing the variation. Rice produced in Asia shows a strong linear relationship between iAs and total As concentration with a slope of 0.78. Rice produced in Europe and the United States shows a more variable, but generally hyperbolic relationship with DMA being predominant in U.S. rice. Although there is significant genotypic variation in grain As speciation, the regional variations are primarily attributed to environmental factors. Emerging evidence also indicates that methylated As species in rice are derived from the soil, while rice plants lack the As methylation ability. Soil flooding and additions of organic matter increase microbial methylation of As, although the microbial community responsible for methylation is poorly understood. Compared with iAs, methylated As species are taken up by rice roots less efficiently but are transported to the grain much more efficiently, which may be an important factor responsible for the spikelet sterility disorder (straight-head disease) in rice. DMA is a weak carcinogen, but the level of ingestion from rice consumption is much lower than that of concern.

Several technologies and approaches have been opted to reduce the damage; however, these have had limited success. Recently, scientists have been focusing their efforts on developing efficient and environmentally friendly nanobactericides for controlling bacterial diseases in rice fields. In the present study, a scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) were utilized to investigate the mode of actions of ginger EOs on the cell structure of <i>Xoo</i>. The ginger EOs caused the cells to grow abnormally, resulting in an irregular form with hollow layers, whereas the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment showed a typical rod shape for the <i>Xoo</i> cell. Ginger EOs restricted the growth and production of biofilms by reducing the number of biofilms generated as indicated by CLSM. Due to the instability, poor solubility, and durability of ginger EOs, a nanoemulsions approach was used, and a glasshouse trial was performed to assess their efficacy on BLB disease control. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the developed nanobactericides was promising at different concentration (50-125 µL/mL) tested. The efficacy was concentration-dependent. There was significant antibacterial activity recorded at higher concentrations. A glasshouse trial revealed that developed nanobactericides managed to suppress BLB disease severity effectively. Treatment at a concentration of 125 μL/mL was the best based on the suppression of disease severity index, AUDPC value, disease reduction (DR), and protection index (PI). Furthermore, findings on plant growth, physiological features, and yield parameters were significantly enhanced compared to the positive control treatment. In conclusion, the results indicated that ginger essential oils loaded-nanoemulsions are a promising alternative to synthetic antibiotics in suppressing <i>Xoo</i> growth, regulating the BLB disease, and enhancing rice yield under a glasshouse trial.",bacterial leaf blight blb caused ixanthomonas oryzaei pv ioryzaei ixooi one serious rice disease causing huge yield loss worldwide several technology approach opted reduce damage however limited success recently scientist focusing effort developing efficient environmentally friendly nanobactericides controlling bacterial disease rice field present study scanning electron microscope sem transmission electron microscope tem confocal laser scanning microscope clsm utilized investigate mode action ginger eos cell structure ixooi ginger eos caused cell grow abnormally resulting irregular form hollow layer whereas dimethylsulfoxide dmso treatment showed typical rod shape ixooi cell ginger eos restricted growth production biofilms reducing number biofilms generated indicated clsm due instability poor solubility durability ginger eos nanoemulsions approach used glasshouse trial performed assess efficacy blb disease control vitro antibacterial activity developed nanobactericides promising different concentration µlml tested efficacy concentrationdependent significant antibacterial activity recorded higher concentration glasshouse trial revealed developed nanobactericides managed suppress blb disease severity effectively treatment concentration μlml best based suppression disease severity index audpc value disease reduction dr protection index pi furthermore finding plant growth physiological feature yield parameter significantly enhanced compared positive control treatment conclusion result indicated ginger essential oil loadednanoemulsions promising alternative synthetic antibiotic suppressing ixooi growth regulating blb disease enhancing rice yield glasshouse trial,2,"{'Disease': ['one serious rice disease', 'blb disease severity', 'best based suppression disease severity index audpc value disease reduction dr protection index pi', 'blb disease'], 'Treatment': ['dimethylsulfoxide dmso treatment', 'positive control treatment conclusion result'], 'Symptom': []}",2
31655345,Adaptation of the metabolomics profile of rice after Pyricularia oryzae infection.,"Pyricularia oryzae (P. oryzae), one of the most devastating fungal pathogens, is the cause of blast disease in rice. Infection with a blast fungus induces biological responses in the host plant that lead to its survival through the termination or suppression of pathogen growth, and metabolite compounds play vital roles in plant interactions with a wide variety of other organisms. Numerous studies have indicated that rice has a multi-layered plant immune system that includes pre-developed (e.g., cell wall and phytoanticipins), constitutive and inducible (phytoalexins) defence barriers against stresses. Significant progress towards understanding the basis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the defence responses of rice to P. oryzae has been achieved. Nonetheless, even though the important metabolites in the responses of rice to pathogens have been identified, their exact mechanisms and their contributions to plant immunity against blast fungi have not been elucidated. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss recent advances towards the understanding of the integrated metabolite variations in rice after P. oryzae invasion.",pyricularia oryzae p oryzae one devastating fungal pathogen cause blast disease rice infection blast fungus induces biological response host plant lead survival termination suppression pathogen growth metabolite compound play vital role plant interaction wide variety organism numerous study indicated rice multilayered plant immune system includes predeveloped eg cell wall phytoanticipins constitutive inducible phytoalexins defence barrier stress significant progress towards understanding basis molecular mechanism underlying defence response rice p oryzae achieved nonetheless even though important metabolite response rice pathogen identified exact mechanism contribution plant immunity blast fungi elucidated purpose review summarize discus recent advance towards understanding integrated metabolite variation rice p oryzae invasion,2,"{'Disease': ['p oryzae one devastating fungal pathogen cause blast disease rice infection blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

To analyze the roles of brassinosteroid (BR) and ethylene signaling on rice defense to R. solani, wild-type (WT) rice and several mutants and overexpressing (OX) lines were inoculated with R. solani. Mutants d61-1 and d2 were less susceptible to sheath blight disease, bri1-D was more susceptible, and ravl1 and d61-1/EIL1 Ri5 were similarly susceptible compared with WT. The double mutant ravl1/d61-1 was phenotypically similar to the ravl1 mutant. Transcriptome analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and transient assays indicted that RAVL1 might directly activate Ethylene insensitive 3-like 1 (EIL1), a master regulator of ethylene signaling. Mutants ers1 and d61-1/RAVL1 OX were resistant to sheath blight disease, whereas EIL1 RNAi mutants and RAVL1 OX were more susceptible than WT. BRI1 and D2 expression in EIL1 Ri5/RAVL1 OX and EIL1 expression in d61-1/RAVL1 OX indicated that RAVL1 activates BRI1/D2 and EIL1, respectively, independent of BR and ethylene signaling.

The mechanisms underlying rice resistance to M. oryzae, such as transcriptional reprogramming and signalling networks, remain elusive. In this study, we carried out an in-depth comparative transcriptome study on the susceptible and resistant rice cultivars in response to M. oryzae. Our analysis highlighted that rapid, high-amplitude transcriptional reprogramming was important for rice defence against blast fungus. Ribosome- and protein translation-related genes were significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 12 hpi in both cultivars, indicating that the protein translation machinery is regulated in the activation of immunity in rice. Furthermore, we identified a core set of genes that are involved in the rice response to both biotic and abiotic stress. More importantly, among the core genes, we demonstrated that the metallothionein OsMT1a and OsMT1b genes positively regulated rice resistance while a peroxidase gene Perox4 negatively regulated rice resistance to M. oryzae.

31811745,Understanding sheath blight resistance in rice: the road behind and the road ahead.,"Rice sheath blight disease, caused by the basidiomycetous necrotroph Rhizoctonia solani, became one of the major threats to the rice cultivation worldwide, especially after the adoption of high-yielding varieties. The pathogen is challenging to manage because of its extensively broad host range and high genetic variability and also due to the inability to find any satisfactory level of natural resistance from the available rice germplasm. It is high time to find remedies to combat the pathogen for reducing rice yield losses and subsequently to minimize the threat to global food security. The development of genetic resistance is one of the alternative means to avoid the use of hazardous chemical fungicides. This review mainly focuses on the effort of better understanding the host-pathogen relationship, finding the gene loci/markers imparting resistance response and modifying the host genome through transgenic development.

38653755,Phytoalexin sakuranetin attenuates endocytosis and enhances resistance to rice blast.,"Phytoalexin sakuranetin functions in resistance against rice blast. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of sakuranetin remains elusive. Here, we report that rice lines expressing resistance (R) genes were found to contain high levels of sakuranetin, which correlates with attenuated endocytic trafficking of plasma membrane (PM) proteins. Exogenous and endogenous sakuranetin attenuates the endocytosis of various PM proteins and the fungal effector PWL2. Moreover, accumulation of the avirulence protein AvrCO39, resulting from uptake into rice cells by Magnaporthe oryzae, was reduced following treatment with sakuranetin. Pharmacological manipulation of clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) suggests that this pathway is targeted by sakuranetin. Indeed, attenuation of CME by sakuranetin is sufficient to convey resistance against rice blast. Our data reveals a mechanism of rice against M. oryzae by increasing sakuranetin levels and repressing the CME of pathogen effectors, which is distinct from the action of many R genes that mainly function by modulating transcription.",phytoalexin sakuranetin function resistance rice blast however mechanism underlying effect sakuranetin remains elusive report rice line expressing resistance r gene found contain high level sakuranetin correlate attenuated endocytic trafficking plasma membrane pm protein exogenous endogenous sakuranetin attenuates endocytosis various pm protein fungal effector pwl moreover accumulation avirulence protein avrco resulting uptake rice cell magnaporthe oryzae reduced following treatment sakuranetin pharmacological manipulation clathrinmediated endocytic cme suggests pathway targeted sakuranetin indeed attenuation cme sakuranetin sufficient convey resistance rice blast data reveals mechanism rice oryzae increasing sakuranetin level repressing cme pathogen effector distinct action many r gene mainly function modulating transcription,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['treatment sakuranetin pharmacological manipulation'], 'Symptom': ['underlying effect sakuranetin', 'fungal effector', 'effector distinct action']}",1
32777117,Identification and application of the Pigm-1 gene in rice disease resistance breeding.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. The identification and utilization of resistance genes are crucial and significant for breeding resistant rice cultivars. We identified a resistance gene from Shuangkang77009, which is highly resistant to the rice blast isolate Guy11 using map-based cloning. We performed bulked segregant analysis combined with specific length amplified fragment sequencing. We also performed association analysis, candidate gene prediction and cDNA sequencing to identify the candidate gene. The resistance gene is located on chromosome 6, and we ultimately mapped the resistance locus to a 92-kb region. The resistance gene in Shuangkang77009 was allelic to PigmR, hereafter referred to as Pigm-1. The Pigm-1 protein had one amino acid change: serine (Ser) residue 860 was replaced by tyrosine (Tyr) in Pigm-1 compared with the previously identified Pigm protein, which significantly changed the structure of the Pigm-1 protein based on 3-D structure simulation. In addition, using the developed molecular marker linked to the Pigm-1 gene and molecular marker-assisted selection technology, we introduced the Pigm-1 gene into Minghui86, a widely used and excellent restorer. We generated 11 stable homozygous rice lines with desirable agronomic traits and strong resistance to rice blast. In conclusion, Pigm-1, a natural allelic variant of PigmR, was responsible for blast resistance in Shuangkang77009 rice.

To gain molecular insights into the global gene expression changes in rice during tungro, a comparative whole genome transcriptome study was performed on healthy and tungroaffected rice plants using Illumina Hiseq 2500. About 10 GB of sequenced data comprising about 50 million paired end reads per sample were then aligned on to the rice genome. Gene expression analysis revealed around 959 transcripts, related to various cellular pathways concerning stress response and hormonal homeostasis to be differentially expressed. The data was validated through qRT-PCR. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed enrichment of transcripts and processes similar to the differentially expressed genes categories.

21726399,Rice WRKY45 plays important roles in fungal and bacterial disease resistance.,"Plant 'activators', such as benzothiadiazole (BTH), protect plants from various diseases by priming the plant salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway. We have reported previously that a transcription factor identified in rice, WRKY45 (OsWRKY45), plays a pivotal role in BTH-induced disease resistance by mediating SA signalling. Here, we report further functional characterization of WRKY45. Different plant activators vary in their action points, either downstream (BTH and tiadinil) or upstream (probenazole) of SA. Rice resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, induced by both types of plant activator, was markedly reduced in WRKY45-knockdown (WRKY45-kd) rice, indicating a universal role for WRKY45 in chemical-induced resistance. Fungal invasion into rice cells was blocked at most attempted invasion sites (pre-invasive defence) in WRKY45-overexpressing (WRKY45-ox) rice. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated within the cell wall underneath invading fungus appressoria or between the cell wall and the cytoplasm, implying a possible role for H(2)O(2) in pre-invasive defence. Moreover, a hypersensitive reaction-like reaction was observed in rice cells, in which fungal growth was inhibited after invasion (post-invasive defence). The two levels of defence mechanism appear to correspond to Type I and II nonhost resistances. The leaf blast resistance of WRKY45-ox rice plants was much higher than that of other known blast-resistant varieties. WRKY45-ox plants also showed strong panicle blast resistance. BTH-induced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae was compromised in WRKY45-kd rice, whereas WRKY45-ox plants were highly resistant to this pathogen. However, WRKY45-ox plants were susceptible to Rhizoctonia solani. These results indicate the versatility and limitations of the application of this gene.",plant activator benzothiadiazole bth protect plant various disease priming plant salicylic acid sa signalling pathway reported previously transcription factor identified rice wrky oswrky play pivotal role bthinduced disease resistance mediating sa signalling report functional characterization wrky different plant activator vary action point either downstream bth tiadinil upstream probenazole sa rice resistance magnaporthe grisea induced type plant activator markedly reduced wrkyknockdown wrkykd rice indicating universal role wrky chemicalinduced resistance fungal invasion rice cell blocked attempted invasion site preinvasive defence wrkyoverexpressing wrkyox rice hydrogen peroxide accumulated within cell wall underneath invading fungus appressoria cell wall cytoplasm implying possible role ho preinvasive defence moreover hypersensitive reactionlike reaction observed rice cell fungal growth inhibited invasion postinvasive defence two level defence mechanism appear correspond type ii nonhost resistance leaf blast resistance wrkyox rice plant much higher known blastresistant variety wrkyox plant also showed strong panicle blast resistance bthinduced resistance xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae compromised wrkykd rice whereas wrkyox plant highly resistant pathogen however wrkyox plant susceptible rhizoctonia solani result indicate versatility limitation application gene,2,"{'Disease': ['pivotal role bthinduced disease resistance', 'fungus appressoria cell wall cytoplasm'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
30691406,Proteomic dissection of the rice-Fusarium fujikuroi interaction and the correlation between the proteome and transcriptome under disease stress.,"Bakanae disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium fujikuroi, occurs widely throughout Asia and Europe and sporadically in other rice production areas. Recent changes in climate and cropping patterns have aggravated this disease. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of rice bakanae disease resistance, we employed a 6-plex tandem mass tag approach for relative quantitative proteomic comparison of infected and uninfected rice seedlings 7 days post-inoculation with two genotypes: the resistant genotype 93-11 and the susceptible genotype Nipponbare. In total, 123 (77.2% up-regulated, 22.8% down-regulated) and 91 (94.5% up-regulated, 5.5% down-regulated) differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) accumulated in 93-11 and Nipponbare, respectively. Only 11 DEPs were both shared by the two genotypes. Clustering results showed that the protein regulation trends for the two genotypes were highly contrasting, which suggested obviously different interaction mechanisms of the host and the pathogen between 93 and 11 and Nipponbare. Further analysis showed that a noticeable aquaporin, PIP2-2, was sharply upregulated with a fold change (FC) of 109.2 in 93-11, which might be related to pathogen defense and the execution of bakanae disease resistance. Certain antifungal proteins were regulated in both 93-11 and Nipponbare with moderate FCs. These proteins might participate in protecting the cellular integrity required for basic growth of the susceptible genotype. Correlation analysis between the transcriptome and proteome revealed that Pearson correlation coefficients of R = 0.677 (P = 0.0005) and R = - 0.097 (P = 0.702) were obtained for 93-11 and Nipponbare, respectively. Our findings raised an intriguing result that a significant positive correlation only in the resistant genotype, while no correlation was found in the susceptible genotype. The differences in codon usage was hypothesized for the cause of the result. Quantitative proteomic analysis of the rice genotypes 93-11and Nipponbare after F. fujikuroi infection revealed that the aquaporin protein PIP2-2 might execute bakanae disease resistance. The difference in the correlation between the transcriptome and proteome might be due to the differences in codon usage between 93-11and Nipponbare. Overall, the protein regulation trends observed under bakanae disease stress are highly contrasting, and the molecular mechanisms of disease defense are obviously different between 93 and 11 and Nipponbare. In summary, these findings deepen our understanding of the functions of proteins induced by bakanae disease and the mechanisms of rice bakanae disease resistance.",bakanae disease caused fungus fusarium fujikuroi occurs widely throughout asia europe sporadically rice production area recent change climate cropping pattern aggravated disease gain better understanding molecular mechanism rice bakanae disease resistance employed plex tandem mass tag approach relative quantitative proteomic comparison infected uninfected rice seedling day postinoculation two genotype resistant genotype susceptible genotype nipponbare total upregulated downregulated upregulated downregulated differentially expressed protein deps accumulated nipponbare respectively deps shared two genotype clustering result showed protein regulation trend two genotype highly contrasting suggested obviously different interaction mechanism host pathogen nipponbare analysis showed noticeable aquaporin pip sharply upregulated fold change fc might related pathogen defense execution bakanae disease resistance certain antifungal protein regulated nipponbare moderate fcs protein might participate protecting cellular integrity required basic growth susceptible genotype correlation analysis transcriptome proteome revealed pearson correlation coefficient r p r p obtained nipponbare respectively finding raised intriguing result significant positive correlation resistant genotype correlation found susceptible genotype difference codon usage hypothesized cause result quantitative proteomic analysis rice genotype nipponbare f fujikuroi infection revealed aquaporin protein pip might execute bakanae disease resistance difference correlation transcriptome proteome might due difference codon usage nipponbare overall protein regulation trend observed bakanae disease stress highly contrasting molecular mechanism disease defense obviously different nipponbare summary finding deepen understanding function protein induced bakanae disease mechanism rice bakanae disease resistance,3,"{'Disease': ['bakanae disease', 'fungus fusarium fujikuroi', 'asia europe sporadically rice production area recent change climate cropping pattern aggravated disease', 'molecular mechanism rice bakanae disease resistance', 'pathogen defense execution bakanae disease resistance', 'bakanae disease resistance difference correlation transcriptome proteome', 'molecular mechanism disease defense', 'bakanae disease mechanism rice bakanae disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
35581907,Surveillance of Rice Blast Resistance Effectiveness and Emerging Virulent Isolates in Taiwan.,"Rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a dangerous threat to rice production and food security worldwide. Breeding and proper deployment of resistant varieties are effective and environmentally friendly strategies to manage this notorious disease. However, a highly dynamic and quickly evolved rice blast pathogen population in the field has made disease control with resistance germplasms more challenging. Therefore, continued monitoring of pathogen dynamics and application of effective resistance varieties are critical tasks to prolong or sustain field resistance. Here, we report a team project that involved evaluation of rice blast resistance genes and surveillance of <i>M. oryzae</i> field populations in Taiwan. A set of International Rice Research Institute-bred blast-resistant lines (IRBLs) carrying single blast resistance genes was utilized to monitor the field effectiveness of rice blast resistance. Resistance genes such as <i>Ptr</i> (formerly <i>Pita2</i>) and <i>Pi9</i> exhibited the best and most durable resistance against the rice blast fungus population in Taiwan. Interestingly, line IRBLb-B harboring the <i>Pib</i> gene with good field protection has recently shown susceptible lesions in some locations. To dissect the genotypic features of virulent isolates against the <i>Pib</i> resistance gene, <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates were collected and analyzed. Screening of the <i>AvrPib</i> locus revealed that the majority of field isolates still maintained the wild-type <i>AvrPib</i> status but eight virulent genotypes were found. Pot3 insertion appeared to be a major way to disrupt the <i>AvrPib</i> avirulence function. Interestingly, a novel <i>AvrPib</i> double-allele genotype among virulent isolates was first identified. Pot2 repetitive element-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) fingerprinting analysis indicated that mutation events may occur independently among different lineages in different geographic locations of Taiwan.

31346804,Sheath blight of rice: a review and identification of priorities for future research.,"Rice sheath blight research should prioritise optimising biological control approaches, identification of resistance gene mechanisms and application in genetic improvement and smart farming for early disease detection. Rice sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG1-1A, is one of the most devasting diseases of the crop. To move forward with effective crop protection against sheath blight, it is important to review the published information related to pathogenicity and disease management and to determine areas of research that require deeper study. While progress has been made in the identification of pathogenesis-related genes both in rice and in the pathogen, the mechanisms remain unclear. Research related to disease management practices has addressed the use of agronomic practices, chemical control, biological control and genetic improvement: Optimising nitrogen fertiliser use in conjunction with plant spacing can reduce spread of infection while smart agriculture technologies such as crop monitoring with Unmanned Aerial Systems assist in early detection and management of sheath blight disease. Replacing older fungicides with natural fungicides and use of biological agents can provide effective sheath blight control, also minimising environmental impact. Genetic approaches that show promise for the control of sheath blight include treatment with exogenous dsRNA to silence pathogen gene expression, genome editing to develop rice lines with lower susceptibility to sheath blight and development of transgenic rice lines overexpressing or silencing pathogenesis related genes.

26979747,Genetic and biochemical mechanisms of rice resistance to planthopper.,"This article presents a comprehensive review on the genetic and biochemical mechanisms governing rice-planthopper interactions, aiming to contribute substantial planthopper control and facilitate breeding for resistance to planthoppers in rice. The rice planthopper is the most destructive pest of rice and a substantial threat to rice production. The brown planthopper (BPH), white-backed planthopper (WBPH) and small brown planthopper (SBPH) are three species of delphacid planthoppers and important piercing-sucking pests of rice. Host-plant resistance has been recognized as the most practical, economical and environmentally friendly strategy to control planthoppers. Until now, at least 30, 14 and 34 major genes/quantitative trait loci for resistance to BPH, WBPH and SBPH have been identified, respectively. Recent inheritance and molecular mapping of gene analysis showed that some planthopper-resistance genes in rice derived from different donors aggregate in clusters, while resistance to these three species of planthoppers in a single donor is governed not by any one dominant gene but by multiple genes. Notably, Bph14, Bph26, Bph3 and Bph29 were successfully identified as BPH-resistance genes in rice. Biological and chemical studies on the feeding of planthoppers indicate that rice plants have acquired various forms of defence against planthoppers.

26703899,Investigating the biology of plant infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is responsible for the most serious disease of rice and is a continuing threat to ensuring global food security. The fungus has also, however, emerged as a model experimental organism for understanding plant infection processes by pathogenic fungi. This is largely due to its amenability to both classical and molecular genetics, coupled with the efforts of a very large international research community. This review, which is based on a plenary presentation at the 28th Fungal Genetics Conference in Asilomar, California in March 2015, describes recent progress in understanding how M. oryzae uses specialised cell called appressoria to bring about plant infection and the underlying biology of this developmental process. We also review how the fungus is then able to proliferate within rice tissue, deploying effector proteins to facilitate its spread by suppressing plant immunity and promoting growth and development of the fungus.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae responsible serious disease rice continuing threat ensuring global food security fungus also however emerged model experimental organism understanding plant infection process pathogenic fungi largely due amenability classical molecular genetics coupled effort large international research community review based plenary presentation th fungal genetics conference asilomar california march describes recent progress understanding oryzae us specialised cell called appressoria bring plant infection underlying biology developmental process also review fungus able proliferate within rice tissue deploying effector protein facilitate spread suppressing plant immunity promoting growth development fungus,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae responsible serious disease rice continuing threat', 'global food security fungus', 'fungus able proliferate', 'growth development fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector protein facilitate']}",3
36050368,Analysis of a rice blast resistance gene Pita-Fuhui2663 and development of selection marker.,"Rice blast is a detrimental rice disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we identified a resistance gene from the rice cultivar Fuhui 2663 which is resistant to the rice blast isolate KJ201. Through isolated population analyses and sequencing approaches, the candidate gene was traced to chromosome 12. With the use of a map-based cloning strategy, the resistance gene was ultimately mapped to an 80-kb resistance locus region containing the Pita gene. Candidate gene prediction and cDNA sequencing indicated that the target resistance gene in Fuhui 2663 was allelic to Pita, thus being referred to as Pita-Fuhui2663 hereafter. Further analysis showed that the Fuhui 2663 protein had one amino acid change: Ala (A) residue 918 in Pita-Fuhui2663 was replaced by Ser (S) in Pita-S, leading to a significant change in the 3D structure of the Pita-S protein. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments confirmed that Pita-Fuhui2663 is responsible for the resistance phenotype of Fuhui 2663. Importantly, Pita-Fuhui2663 did not affect the main agronomic traits of the variety compared to the Pita gene as verified by knockout experiments, indicative of potential applications of Pita-Fuhui2663 in broader breeding programs. Furthermore, a Pita-Fuhui2663-dCAPS molecular marker with good specificity and high efficiency was developed to facilitate rice breeding for resistance to this devastating disease.",rice blast detrimental rice disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae identified resistance gene rice cultivar fuhui resistant rice blast isolate kj isolated population analysis sequencing approach candidate gene traced chromosome use mapbased cloning strategy resistance gene ultimately mapped kb resistance locus region containing pita gene candidate gene prediction cdna sequencing indicated target resistance gene fuhui allelic pita thus referred pitafuhui hereafter analysis showed fuhui protein one amino acid change ala residue pitafuhui replaced ser pita leading significant change structure pita protein crisprcas knockout experiment confirmed pitafuhui responsible resistance phenotype fuhui importantly pitafuhui affect main agronomic trait variety compared pita gene verified knockout experiment indicative potential application pitafuhui broader breeding program furthermore pitafuhuidcaps molecular marker good specificity high efficiency developed facilitate rice breeding resistance devastating disease,1,"{'Disease': ['rice blast detrimental rice disease', 'fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'facilitate rice breeding resistance devastating disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
20627803,Recent advances in rice blast effector research.,"To cause rice blast disease, the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae produces biotrophic invasive hyphae that secrete effectors at the host-pathogen interface. Effectors facilitate disease development, but some (avirulence effectors) also trigger the host's resistance gene-mediated hypersensitive response and block disease. The number of cloned M. oryzae avirulence effector genes has recently doubled, largely based on resequencing with a Japanese field isolate and association of avirulence activity with presence/absence polymorphisms in novel genes for secreted proteins. Effectors secreted by hyphae in rice cells accumulate in biotrophic interfacial complexes, and this property correlates with their translocation across plasma membrane into the rice cytoplasm. Interestingly, the translocated effectors moved into surrounding uninvaded cells, suggesting that effectors prepare host cells before the fungus enters them.",cause rice blast disease fungus magnaporthe oryzae produce biotrophic invasive hypha secrete effector hostpathogen interface effector facilitate disease development avirulence effector also trigger host resistance genemediated hypersensitive response block disease number cloned oryzae avirulence effector gene recently doubled largely based resequencing japanese field isolate association avirulence activity presenceabsence polymorphism novel gene secreted protein effector secreted hypha rice cell accumulate biotrophic interfacial complex property correlate translocation across plasma membrane rice cytoplasm interestingly translocated effector moved surrounding uninvaded cell suggesting effector prepare host cell fungus enters,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'biotrophic invasive hypha secrete effector hostpathogen interface effector facilitate disease development avirulence effector', 'host resistance genemediated hypersensitive response block disease number', 'host cell fungus enters'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['biotrophic invasive hypha secrete effector hostpathogen interface effector facilitate disease development avirulence effector', 'oryzae avirulence effector gene', 'protein effector', 'interestingly translocated effector', 'effector']}",1

The effects of enhanced UV-B radiation (0 kJ m<sup>-2</sup>, 2.5 kJ m<sup>-2</sup>, 5.0 kJ m<sup>-2</sup> and 7.5 kJ m<sup>-2</sup>) on the rice-Magnaporthe oryzae system were studied with respect to the Magnaporthe oryzae infection, the disease-resistance physiology of the rice and the rice blast disease condition. The results showed that under enhanced UV-B radiation, the infectivity of Magnaporthe oryzae was decreased, which could significantly inhibit its growth and sporulation. The activities of rice leaf disease-resistance-related enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, lipoxygenase, chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase) were significantly increased under enhanced UV-B radiation. Following inoculation with Magnaporthe oryzae, levels of disease-resistance-related substances in the rice leaves were significantly increased. Among the results, it was found that leaves after UV-B radiation had a more significant resistance response. The level of UV-B irradiation showed a parabolic relationship with the rice blast index (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.85, P < 0.01; in the control group, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.88, P < 0.01). The disease index decreased with increase in irradiation. The DI was at a minimum with enhanced UV-B irradiance of 4 kJ m<sup>-2</sup>; thereafter, it increased with increasing irradiation.

39404763,Phytochrome B promotes blast disease resistance and enhances yield in rice.,"Phytochromes are red/far-red light receptors that regulate various aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. The precise mechanism by which phytochrome B (PhyB)-mediated light signaling influences plant defense and development remains unclear. In this study, we showed that PhyB enhances rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease resistance, tillering, and grain size compared to wild-type plants. Notably, PhyB interacted with and degraded grassy tiller 1 (GT1), a negative regulator of tiller development. Knockdown of GT1 in a phyB background partially rescued the diminished tillering of phyB. However, GT1 negatively regulates rice resistance to blast, suggesting that PhyB degradation of GT1 promotes tillering but not blast resistance. Previously, PhyB was found to interact with and degrade phytochrome-interacting factor 15 (PIL15), a key regulator of seed development that reduces rice resistance to blast and seed size. pil15 mutation in phyB mutants rescued phyB seed size and blast resistance, suggesting that PhyB might interact with and degrade PIL15 to negatively regulate blast resistance and seed size. PIL15 directly activated sugar will be eventually exported transporter 2a (SWEET2a). sweet2a mutants were less susceptible to blast disease compared to wild type. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PhyB promotes rice yield and blast resistance by inhibiting the transcription factors GT1 and PIL15 and downstream signaling.",phytochromes redfarred light receptor regulate various aspect plant growth development stress response precise mechanism phytochrome b phybmediated light signaling influence plant defense development remains unclear study showed phyb enhances rice oryza sativa blast disease resistance tillering grain size compared wildtype plant notably phyb interacted degraded grassy tiller gt negative regulator tiller development knockdown gt phyb background partially rescued diminished tillering phyb however gt negatively regulates rice resistance blast suggesting phyb degradation gt promotes tillering blast resistance previously phyb found interact degrade phytochromeinteracting factor pil key regulator seed development reduces rice resistance blast seed size pil mutation phyb mutant rescued phyb seed size blast resistance suggesting phyb might interact degrade pil negatively regulate blast resistance seed size pil directly activated sugar eventually exported transporter sweeta sweeta mutant less susceptible blast disease compared wild type collectively data demonstrate phyb promotes rice yield blast resistance inhibiting transcription factor gt pil downstream signaling,2,"{'Disease': ['rice oryza sativa blast disease resistance', 'less susceptible blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
9291958,Alien introgression in rice.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity is affected by several biotic and abiotic stresses. The genetic variability for some of these stresses is limited in the cultivated rice germplasm. Moreover, changes in insect biotypes and disease races are a continuing threat to increased rice production. There is thus an urgent need to broaden the rice gene pool by introgressing genes for such traits from diverse sources. The wild species of Oryza representing AA, BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG and HHJJ genomes are an important reservoir of useful genes. However, low crossability and limited recombination between chromosomes of cultivated and wild species limit the transfer of such genes. AT IRRI, a series of hybrids and monosomic alien addition lines have been produced through embryo rescue following hybridization between rice and several distantly related species. Cytoplasmic male sterility and genes for resistance to grassy stunt virus and bacterial blight have been transferred from A genome wild species into rice. Similarly, genes for resistance to brown planthopper, bacterial blight and blast have also been introgressed across crossability barriers from distanly related species into rice. Some of the introgressed genes have been mapped via linkage to molecular markers. One of the genes Xa-21 introgressed from O. longistaminata has been cloned and physically mapped on chromosome 11 of rice using BAC library and flourescence in-situ hybridization. RFLP analysis revealed introgression from 11 of the 12 chromosomes of C genome species into rice. Introgression has also been obtained from other distant genomes (EE, FF, GG) into rice and in majority of the cases one or two RFLP markers were introgressed. Reciprocal replacement of RFLP alleles of wild species with the alleles of O. sativa indicates alien gene transfer through crossing over. The rapid recovery of recurrent phenotypes in BC2 and BC3 generations from wide crosses is an indication of limited recombination. Further cytogenetic and molecular investigations are required to determine precisely the mechanism of introgression of small chromosome segments from distant genomes in the face of limited homoeologous chromosome pairing. Future research should focus on enhancing recombination between homoeologous chromosomes. Introgression of QTL from wild species should be attempted to increase the yield potential of rice.",rice oryza sativa l productivity affected several biotic abiotic stress genetic variability stress limited cultivated rice germplasm moreover change insect biotype disease race continuing threat increased rice production thus urgent need broaden rice gene pool introgressing gene trait diverse source wild specie oryza representing aa bb cc bbcc ccdd ee ff gg hhjj genome important reservoir useful gene however low crossability limited recombination chromosome cultivated wild specie limit transfer gene irri series hybrid monosomic alien addition line produced embryo rescue following hybridization rice several distantly related specie cytoplasmic male sterility gene resistance grassy stunt virus bacterial blight transferred genome wild specie rice similarly gene resistance brown planthopper bacterial blight blast also introgressed across crossability barrier distanly related specie rice introgressed gene mapped via linkage molecular marker one gene xa introgressed longistaminata cloned physically mapped chromosome rice using bac library flourescence insitu hybridization rflp analysis revealed introgression chromosome c genome specie rice introgression also obtained distant genome ee ff gg rice majority case one two rflp marker introgressed reciprocal replacement rflp allele wild specie allele sativa indicates alien gene transfer crossing rapid recovery recurrent phenotype bc bc generation wide cross indication limited recombination cytogenetic molecular investigation required determine precisely mechanism introgression small chromosome segment distant genome face limited homoeologous chromosome pairing future research focus enhancing recombination homoeologous chromosome introgression qtl wild specie attempted increase yield potential rice,0,"{'Disease': ['insect biotype disease race continuing threat', 'several distantly related specie cytoplasmic male sterility gene resistance grassy stunt virus bacterial blight transferred genome wild specie rice similarly gene resistance brown planthopper bacterial blight blast'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
28700950,Transcriptional changes of rice in response to rice black-streaked dwarf virus.,"Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a member of the genus Fijivirus in the family Reoviridae, causes significant economic losses in rice production in China and many other Asian countries. Although a great deal of effort has been made to elucidate the interactions among the virus, insect vectors, host and environmental conditions, few RBSDV proteins involved in pathogenesis have been identified, and the biological basis of disease development in rice remains largely unknown. Transcriptomic information associated with the disease development in rice would be helpful to unravel the biological mechanism. To determine how the rice transcriptome changes in response to RBSDV infection, we carried out RNA-Seq to perform a genome-wide gene expression analysis of a susceptible rice cultivar KTWYJ3. The transcriptomes of RBSDV-infected samples were compared to those of RBSDV-free (healthy) at two time points (time points are represented by group I and II). The results derived from the differential expression analysis in RBSDV-infected libraries vs. healthy ones in group I revealed that 102 out of a total of 281 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated and 179 DEGs were down-regulated. Of the 2592 identified DEGs in group II, 1588 DEGs were up-regulated and 1004 DEGs were down-regulated. A total of 66 DEGs were commonly identified in both groups. Of these 66 DEGs, expression patterns for 36 DEGs were similar in both groups. Our analysis demonstrated that some genes related to disease defense and stress resistance were up-regulated while genes associated with chloroplast were down-regulated in response to RBSDV infection. In addition, some genes associated with plant-height were differentially expressed. This result indicates those genes might be involved in dwarf symptoms caused by RBSDV. Taken together, our results provide a genome-wide transcriptome analysis for rice plants in response to RBSDV infection which may contribute to the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in rice-RBSDV interaction and the biological basis of rice black-streaked dwarf disease development in rice.",rice blackstreaked dwarf virus rbsdv member genus fijivirus family reoviridae cause significant economic loss rice production china many asian country although great deal effort made elucidate interaction among virus insect vector host environmental condition rbsdv protein involved pathogenesis identified biological basis disease development rice remains largely unknown transcriptomic information associated disease development rice would helpful unravel biological mechanism determine rice transcriptome change response rbsdv infection carried rnaseq perform genomewide gene expression analysis susceptible rice cultivar ktwyj transcriptomes rbsdvinfected sample compared rbsdvfree healthy two time point time point represented group ii result derived differential expression analysis rbsdvinfected library v healthy one group revealed total significant differentially expressed gene degs upregulated degs downregulated identified degs group ii degs upregulated degs downregulated total degs commonly identified group degs expression pattern degs similar group analysis demonstrated gene related disease defense stress resistance upregulated gene associated chloroplast downregulated response rbsdv infection addition gene associated plantheight differentially expressed result indicates gene might involved dwarf symptom caused rbsdv taken together result provide genomewide transcriptome analysis rice plant response rbsdv infection may contribute understanding regulatory mechanism involved ricerbsdv interaction biological basis rice blackstreaked dwarf disease development rice,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blackstreaked dwarf virus rbsdv member genus fijivirus family reoviridae', 'virus insect vector host environmental condition rbsdv protein', 'biological basis disease development rice', 'largely unknown transcriptomic information associated disease development rice', 'gene related disease defense stress resistance upregulated gene associated chloroplast downregulated response rbsdv infection addition gene associated plantheight', 'ricerbsdv interaction biological basis rice blackstreaked dwarf disease development rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['dwarf symptom']}",3
31001874,Osa-miR167d facilitates infection of Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in rice response to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. Studying the roles of rice miRNAs is of great significance for the disease control. Osa-miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses. Here, we show that Osa-miR167d plays a negative role in rice immunity against M. oryzae by suppressing its target gene. The expression of Osa-miR167d was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 h post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M. oryzae infection. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing Osa-miR167d were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains. By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block Osa-miR167d enhanced resistance to rice blast disease. In addition, knocking out the target gene ARF12 led to hyper-susceptibility to multiple blast fungal strains. Taken together, our results indicate that Osa-miR167d negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M. oryzae by downregulating ARF12.

38953747,A NAC transcription factor MNAC3-centered regulatory network negatively modulates rice immunity against blast disease.,"NAC transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal in plant immunity against diverse pathogens. Here, we report the functional and regulatory network of MNAC3, a novel NAC TF, in rice immunity. MNAC3, a transcriptional activator, negatively modulates rice immunity against blast and bacterial leaf blight diseases and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immune responses. MNAC3 binds to a CACG cis-element and activates the transcription of immune-negative target genes OsINO80, OsJAZ10, and OsJAZ11. The negative function of MNAC3 in rice immunity depends on its transcription of downstream genes such as OsINO80 and OsJAZ10. MNAC3 interacts with immunity-related OsPP2C41 (a protein phosphatase), ONAC066 (a NAC TF), and OsDjA6 (a DnaJ chaperone). ONAC066 and OsPP2C41 attenuate MNAC3 transcriptional activity, while OsDjA6 promotes it. Phosphorylation of MNAC3 at S163 is critical for its negative functions in rice immunity. OsPP2C41, which plays positive roles in rice blast resistance and chitin-triggered immune responses, dephosphorylates MNAC3, suppressing its transcriptional activity on the target genes OsINO80, OsJAZ10, and OsJAZ11 and promoting the translocation of MNAC3 from nucleus to cytoplasm. These results establish a MNAC3-centered regulatory network in which OsPP2C41 dephosphorylates MNAC3, attenuating its transcriptional activity on downstream immune-negative target genes in rice. Together, these findings deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms in rice immunity and offer a novel strategy for genetic improvement of rice disease resistance.",nac transcription factor tfs pivotal plant immunity diverse pathogen report functional regulatory network mnac novel nac tf rice immunity mnac transcriptional activator negatively modulates rice immunity blast bacterial leaf blight disease pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamptriggered immune response mnac bind cacg ciselement activates transcription immunenegative target gene osino osjaz osjaz negative function mnac rice immunity depends transcription downstream gene osino osjaz mnac interacts immunityrelated osppc protein phosphatase onac nac tf osdja dnaj chaperone onac osppc attenuate mnac transcriptional activity osdja promotes phosphorylation mnac critical negative function rice immunity osppc play positive role rice blast resistance chitintriggered immune response dephosphorylates mnac suppressing transcriptional activity target gene osino osjaz osjaz promoting translocation mnac nucleus cytoplasm result establish mnaccentered regulatory network osppc dephosphorylates mnac attenuating transcriptional activity downstream immunenegative target gene rice together finding deepen understanding molecular mechanism rice immunity offer novel strategy genetic improvement rice disease resistance,4,"{'Disease': ['rice immunity blast bacterial leaf blight disease', 'novel strategy genetic improvement rice disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
10487219,Chemical induction of disease resistance in rice is correlated with the expression of a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats.,"Probenazole (3-allyloxy-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide) is an agricultural chemical primarily used to prevent rice blast disease. Probenazole-treated rice acquires resistance to blast fungus irrespective of the rice variety. The chemical is applied prophylactically, and is thought to induce or bolster endogenous plant defenses. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been established. To understand the mode of the chemical's action, we screened for novel probenazole-responsive genes in rice by means of differential display and identified a candidate gene, RPR1. RPR1 contains a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats, thus sharing structural similarity with known disease resistance genes. The expression of RPR1 in rice can be up-regulated by treatment with chemical inducers of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and by inoculation with pathogens. RPR1-related sequences in rice varieties seem to be varied in sequence and/or expression, indicating that RPR1 itself is not a crucial factor for induced resistance in rice. However, Southern blot analysis revealed the existence of homologous sequences in all varieties examined. While the role of RPR1 has yet to be clarified, this is the first report of the identification of a member of this gene class and its induction during the systemic expression of induced disease resistance.",probenazole allyloxybenzisothiazoledioxide agricultural chemical primarily used prevent rice blast disease probenazoletreated rice acquires resistance blast fungus irrespective rice variety chemical applied prophylactically thought induce bolster endogenous plant defense however mechanism underlying effect established understand mode chemical action screened novel probenazoleresponsive gene rice mean differential display identified candidate gene rpr rpr contains nucleotide binding site leucinerich repeat thus sharing structural similarity known disease resistance gene expression rpr rice upregulated treatment chemical inducer systemic acquired resistance sar inoculation pathogen rprrelated sequence rice variety seem varied sequence andor expression indicating rpr crucial factor induced resistance rice however southern blot analysis revealed existence homologous sequence variety examined role rpr yet clarified first report identification member gene class induction systemic expression induced disease resistance,1,"{'Disease': ['prevent rice blast disease', 'resistance blast fungus irrespective rice variety chemical', 'structural similarity known disease resistance gene expression rpr rice upregulated treatment chemical inducer systemic acquired resistance sar inoculation pathogen rprrelated sequence rice variety', 'first report identification member gene class induction systemic expression induced disease resistance'], 'Treatment': ['structural similarity known disease resistance gene expression rpr rice upregulated treatment chemical inducer systemic acquired resistance sar inoculation pathogen rprrelated sequence rice variety'], 'Symptom': ['underlying effect']}",4
23396040,Towards understanding of molecular interactions between rice and the brown planthopper.,"The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most notorious pest of rice (Oryza sativa). Studies of rice-BPH interaction have contributed to development of new rice varieties, offering an effective means for long-lasting control of BPH. Here, we review the status of knowledge of the molecular basis of rice-BPH interaction, from the perspective of immunity. The BPH has complicated feeding behaviors on rice, which are mainly related to host resistance. Now, 24 resistance genes have been detected in rice, indicating gene-for-gene relationships with biotypes of the BPH. However, only one BPH resistance gene (Bph14) was identified and characterized using map-based cloning. Bph14 encodes an immune receptor of NB-LRR family, providing a means for studying the molecular mechanisms of rice resistance to BPH. Plant hormones (e.g. salicylic acid and jasmonate/ethylene), Ca(2+), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and OsRac1 play important roles in the immune response of rice to BPH. Signal transduction leads to modifying expression of defense-related genes and defense mechanisms against BPH, including sieve tube sealing, production of secondary metabolites, and induction of proteinase inhibitor.

The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) immune receptor pairs Pik-1/Pik-2 and RGA5/RGA4 both use integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domains to bind the effectors AVR-Pik and AVR-Pia, respectively, from the rice blast fungal pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> These effectors both belong to the MAX effector family and share a core structural fold, despite being divergent in sequence. How integrated domains in NLRs maintain specificity of effector recognition, even of structurally similar effectors, has implications for understanding plant immune receptor evolution and function. Here, using plant cell death and pathogenicity assays and protein-protein interaction analyses, we show that the rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 triggers an immune response leading to partial disease resistance toward the ""mis-matched"" effector AVR-Pia <i>in planta</i> and that the Pikp-HMA domain binds AVR-Pia <i>in vitro</i> We observed that the HMA domain from another Pik-1 allele, Pikm, cannot bind AVR-Pia, and it does not trigger a plant response. The crystal structure of Pikp-HMA bound to AVR-Pia at 1.9 Å resolution revealed a binding interface different from those formed with AVR-Pik effectors, suggesting plasticity in integrated domain-effector interactions. The results of our work indicate that a single NLR immune receptor can bait multiple pathogen effectors via an integrated domain, insights that may enable engineering plant immune receptors with extended disease resistance profiles.",unconventional integrated domain plant intracellular immune receptor nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat nlrs type directly bind translocated effector protein pathogen thereby initiate immune response rice ioryza sativai immune receptor pair pikpik rgarga use integrated heavy metalassociated hma domain bind effector avrpik avrpia respectively rice blast fungal pathogen imagnaporthe oryzaei effector belong max effector family share core structural fold despite divergent sequence integrated domain nlrs maintain specificity effector recognition even structurally similar effector implication understanding plant immune receptor evolution function using plant cell death pathogenicity assay proteinprotein interaction analysis show rice nlr pair pikppikp trigger immune response leading partial disease resistance toward mismatched effector avrpia iin plantai pikphma domain bind avrpia iin vitroi observed hma domain another pik allele pikm bind avrpia trigger plant response crystal structure pikphma bound avrpia å resolution revealed binding interface different formed avrpik effector suggesting plasticity integrated domaineffector interaction result work indicate single nlr immune receptor bait multiple pathogen effector via integrated domain insight may enable engineering plant immune receptor extended disease resistance profile,4,"{'Disease': ['leading partial disease resistance', 'engineering plant immune receptor extended disease resistance profile'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['rice blast fungal pathogen imagnaporthe oryzaei effector', 'max effector family', 'specificity effector recognition', 'similar effector implication', 'mismatched effector avrpia iin plantai pikphma domain bind avrpia iin vitroi observed hma domain', 'binding interface different formed avrpik effector', 'plasticity integrated domaineffector interaction result work', 'single nlr immune receptor bait multiple pathogen effector']}",1
22267486,Effector-mediated suppression of chitin-triggered immunity by magnaporthe oryzae is necessary for rice blast disease.,"Plants use pattern recognition receptors to defend themselves from microbial pathogens. These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate signaling pathways that lead to immunity. In rice (Oryza sativa), the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) recognizes chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell walls of fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae overcomes this first line of plant defense by secreting an effector protein, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), during invasion of new rice cells. We demonstrate that Slp1 accumulates at the interface between the fungal cell wall and the rice plasma membrane, can bind to chitin, and is able to suppress chitin-induced plant immune responses, including generation of reactive oxygen species and plant defense gene expression. Furthermore, we show that Slp1 competes with CEBiP for binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Slp1 is required by M. oryzae for full virulence and exerts a significant effect on tissue invasion and disease lesion expansion. By contrast, gene silencing of CEBiP in rice allows M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease in the absence of Slp1. We propose that Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to prevent PAMP-triggered immunity in rice, thereby facilitating rapid spread of the fungus within host tissue.",plant use pattern recognition receptor defend microbial pathogen receptor recognize pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamps activate signaling pathway lead immunity rice oryza sativa chitin elicitor binding protein cebip recognizes chitin oligosaccharide released cell wall fungal pathogen show rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae overcomes first line plant defense secreting effector protein secreted lysm protein slp invasion new rice cell demonstrate slp accumulates interface fungal cell wall rice plasma membrane bind chitin able suppress chitininduced plant immune response including generation reactive oxygen specie plant defense gene expression furthermore show slp competes cebip binding chitin oligosaccharide slp required oryzae full virulence exerts significant effect tissue invasion disease lesion expansion contrast gene silencing cebip rice allows oryzae cause rice blast disease absence slp propose slp sequesters chitin oligosaccharide prevent pamptriggered immunity rice thereby facilitating rapid spread fungus within host tissue,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'rice blast disease absence', 'rapid spread fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['overcomes first line plant defense secreting effector protein']}",4
23031077,Transgenic rice with inducible ethylene production exhibits broad-spectrum disease resistance to the fungal pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani.,"Rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) are the two most devastating diseases of rice (Oryza sativa), and have severe impacts on crop yield and grain quality. Recent evidence suggests that ethylene (ET) may play a more prominent role than salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in mediating rice disease resistance. In this study, we attempt to genetically manipulate endogenous ET levels in rice for enhancing resistance to rice blast and sheath blight diseases. Transgenic lines with inducible production of ET were generated by expressing the rice ACS2 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase, a key enzyme of ET biosynthesis) transgene under control of a strong pathogen-inducible promoter. In comparison with the wild-type plant, the OsACS2-overexpression lines showed significantly increased levels of the OsACS2 transcripts, endogenous ET and defence gene expression, especially in response to pathogen infection. More importantly, the transgenic lines exhibited increased resistance to a field isolate of R. solani, as well as different races of M. oryzae. Assessment of the growth rate, generational time and seed production revealed little or no differences between wild type and transgenic lines. These results suggest that pathogen-inducible production of ET in transgenic rice can enhance resistance to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens without negatively impacting crop productivity.",rice blast magnaporthe oryzae sheath blight rhizoctonia solani two devastating disease rice oryza sativa severe impact crop yield grain quality recent evidence suggests ethylene et may play prominent role salicylic acid jasmonic acid mediating rice disease resistance study attempt genetically manipulate endogenous et level rice enhancing resistance rice blast sheath blight disease transgenic line inducible production et generated expressing rice ac aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid synthase key enzyme et biosynthesis transgene control strong pathogeninducible promoter comparison wildtype plant osacsoverexpression line showed significantly increased level osacs transcript endogenous et defence gene expression especially response pathogen infection importantly transgenic line exhibited increased resistance field isolate r solani well different race oryzae assessment growth rate generational time seed production revealed little difference wild type transgenic line result suggest pathogeninducible production et transgenic rice enhance resistance necrotrophic hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen without negatively impacting crop productivity,2,"{'Disease': ['rice blast magnaporthe oryzae sheath blight rhizoctonia solani two devastating disease rice oryza sativa severe impact crop yield grain quality recent evidence', 'salicylic acid jasmonic acid mediating rice disease resistance study attempt', 'resistance rice blast sheath blight disease transgenic line inducible production et'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['rice blast magnaporthe oryzae sheath blight rhizoctonia solani two devastating disease rice oryza sativa severe impact crop yield grain quality recent evidence', 'negatively impacting crop productivity']}",0
18513376,Physiological and cytological mechanisms of silicon-induced resistance in rice against blast disease.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the most destructive diseases in the rice-growing areas of the world. Silicon is an important nutritional element especially for rice. Two near-isogenic lines of rice with different resistance to blast disease, i.e. CO39 (susceptible) and C101LAC (Pi-1) (resistant), were selected to determine the effects of Si amendment on the severity and incidence of rice blast disease. The physiological and cytological mechanisms involved in the induced disease resistance by silicon were investigated. Exogenous Si application at a concentration of 2 mM reduced the disease index by 45% for CO39 and 56% for C101LAC (Pi-1). Si application alone did not change lignin content and the activities of defense-related enzymes including peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in rice leaves of both isogenic lines. However, after inoculation with M. grisea, Si-treated rice plants significantly increased the activities of POD, PPO and PAL in leaves of both isogenic lines. Si and lignin content were also significantly increased in Si-treated inoculated seedlings. Environmental scanning electron microscope observations revealed that Si amendment resulted in higher Si deposit on dumbbell bodies in the rice leaves and silicon papilla accumulation on the guard cell of stoma. These results suggest that silicon-induced defense response and cell silicification of rice leaves altogether contribute to the silicon-induced rice resistance to blast disease.",rice oryza sativa l blast disease caused magnaporthe grisea one destructive disease ricegrowing area world silicon important nutritional element especially rice two nearisogenic line rice different resistance blast disease ie co susceptible clac pi resistant selected determine effect si amendment severity incidence rice blast disease physiological cytological mechanism involved induced disease resistance silicon investigated exogenous si application concentration mm reduced disease index co clac pi si application alone change lignin content activity defenserelated enzyme including peroxidase pod polyphenol oxidase ppo phenylalanine ammonialyase pal rice leaf isogenic line however inoculation grisea sitreated rice plant significantly increased activity pod ppo pal leaf isogenic line si lignin content also significantly increased sitreated inoculated seedling environmental scanning electron microscope observation revealed si amendment resulted higher si deposit dumbbell body rice leaf silicon papilla accumulation guard cell stoma result suggest siliconinduced defense response cell silicification rice leaf altogether contribute siliconinduced rice resistance blast disease,2,"{'Disease': ['rice oryza sativa l blast disease', 'magnaporthe grisea one destructive disease ricegrowing area world silicon important nutritional element', 'two nearisogenic line rice different resistance blast disease', 'co susceptible clac pi resistant selected determine effect si amendment severity incidence rice blast disease physiological cytological mechanism', 'induced disease resistance silicon', 'mm reduced disease index co clac pi si application', 'siliconinduced rice resistance blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['co susceptible clac pi resistant selected determine effect si amendment severity incidence rice blast disease physiological cytological mechanism']}",2
34608507,Cloning and functional analysis of the novel rice blast resistance gene Pi65 in japonica rice.,"Pi65, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) domain cloned from Oryza sativa japonica, is a novel rice blast disease resistance gene. Rice blast seriously threatens rice production worldwide. Utilizing the rice blast resistance gene to breed rice blast-resistant varieties is one of the best ways to control rice blast disease. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we cloned a novel rice blast resistance gene, Pi65, from the resistant variety GangYu129 (abbreviated GY129, Oryza sativa japonica). Overexpression of Pi65 in the susceptible variety LiaoXing1 (abbreviated LX1, Oryza sativa japonica) enhanced rice blast resistance, while knockout of Pi65 in GY129 resulted in susceptibility to rice blast disease. Pi65 encodes two transmembrane domains, with 15 LRR domains and one serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain, conferring resistance to isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae (abbreviated M. oryzae) collected from Northeast China. There were sixteen amino acid differences between the Pi65 resistance and susceptible alleles. Compared with the Pi65-resistant allele, the susceptible allele exhibited one LRR domain deletion. Pi65 was constitutively expressed in whole plants, and it could be induced in the early stage of M. oryzae infection. Transcriptome analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with disease resistance were specifically upregulated in GY129 24 h post inoculation (HPI); in contrast, photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were particularly downregulated at 24 HPI, demonstrating that disease resistance-associated genes were activated in GY129 (carrying Pi65) after rice blast fungal infection and that cellular basal metabolism and energy metabolism were inhibited simultaneously.

36010612,Improvement of Bacterial Blight Resistance in Two Conventionally Cultivated Rice Varieties by Editing the Noncoding Region.,"<i>xa13</i> is a recessive pleiotropic gene that positively regulates rice disease resistance and negatively regulates rice fertility; thus, seriously restricting its rice breeding application. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology was used to delete the <i>Xa13</i> gene promoter partial sequence, including the pathogenic bacteria-inducible expression element. Rice with the edited promoter region lost the ability for pathogen-induced gene expression without affecting background gene expression in leaves and anthers, resulting in disease resistance and normal yield. The study also screened a family of disease-resistant and normal fertile plants in which the target sequence was deleted and the exogenous transgene fragment isolated in the T<sub>1</sub> generation (transgene-free line). Important agronomic traits of the T<sub>2</sub> generation rice were examined. T<sub>2</sub> generation rice with/without exogenous DNA showed no statistical differences compared to the wild type in heading stage, plant height, panicles per plant, panicle length, or seed setting rate in the field.

33120987,A Comprehensive Analysis of MicroRNAs Expressed in Susceptible and Resistant Rice Cultivars during <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> AG1-IA Infection Causing Sheath Blight Disease.,"MicroRNAs regulate plant responses to fungal infections and immunity. In this study, miRNAs were identified in six rice cultivars during a <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> Kühn AG1-IA infection using a deep sequencing approach. Known and novel miRNAs were analyzed in these rice cultivars, and a set of fungal infection/immunity-associated miRNAs and target genes were quantified by reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR in six rice cultivars. Additionally, the relative expression of these miRNAs was analyzed in different time points of the infection, wild species of rice, and in response to different strains of <i>R. solani</i>. Osa-miR1320-5p showed preferential expression during the fungal infection in all the six rice genotypes, while Osa-miR156d, Osa-miR159b, Osa-miR820c, and Osa-miR1876 were differentially regulated in susceptible and resistant genotypes.

28922766,Altered accumulation of osa-miR171b contributes to rice stripe virus infection by regulating disease symptoms.,"Viral infection affects the pattern of plant miRNA expression. It has been presumed that reduction of miR171 and several other miRNAs influences viral symptoms in plants. We here experimentally demonstrate the association of osa-miR171b with rice stripe virus (RSV) symptoms in rice. Inhibition of osa-miR171b caused stunting with reduced chlorophyll content in leaves similar to viral symptoms. Overexpression of osa-miR171b by an artificial miRNA extended vegetative growth and enhanced chlorophyll accumulation in leaves. Tillers were thicker, and panicles were longer with more spikelets in plants overexpressing osa-miR171b than in controls, but there were no differences in tiller numbers. Targets of osa-miR171b, OsSCL6-IIa, OsSCL6-IIb, and OsSCL6-IIc, were respectively up- and down-regulated in plants where osa-miR171b was inhibited or overexpressed. In plants overexpressing osa-miR171b, five positive regulators for heading development, Ehd1, Ehd2, Ehd3, Ehd4, and Hd3a were up-regulated, while the negative regulator Ghd7 was down-regulated. Plants overexpressing osa-miR171b were less susceptible to RSV and virus symptoms were attenuated.

28857351,MAPK kinase 10.2 promotes disease resistance and drought tolerance by activating different MAPKs in rice.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, with each cascade consisting of a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and a MAPK, have important roles in different biological processes. However, the signal transduction in rice MAPK cascades remains to be elucidated. We show that the structural non-canonical MAPKK, MPKK10.2, enhances rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes bacterial streak disease, and increases rice tolerance to drought stress by phosphorylating and activating two MAPKs, MPK6 and MPK3, respectively. MPKK10.2-overexpressing (oe) plants showed enhanced resistance to both Xoc and drought, whereas MPKK10.2-RNA interference (RNAi) plants had increased sensitivity to both Xoc and drought. MPKK10.2 physically interacted with MPK6 and MPK3, and phosphorylated the two MAPKs in vivo. Transcriptionally modulating MPKK10.2 influenced MPK6 phosphorylation during rice-Xoc interaction, and MPKK10.2-oe/MPK6-RNAi double mutants showed increased sensitivity to Xoc. MPKK10.2-oe/MPK3-RNAi double mutants showed survival rates similar to those of control plants, although the survival rates of MPKK10.2 transgenic plants changed after drought stress. These results suggest that MPKK10.2 is a node involved in rice response to biotic and abiotic responses by functioning in the cross-point of two MAPK cascades leading to Xoc resistance and drought tolerance.",mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk cascade cascade consisting mapk kinase kinase mapkkk mapk kinase mapkk mapk important role different biological process however signal transduction rice mapk cascade remains elucidated show structural noncanonical mapkk mpkk enhances rice resistance xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola xoc cause bacterial streak disease increase rice tolerance drought stress phosphorylating activating two mapks mpk mpk respectively mpkkoverexpressing oe plant showed enhanced resistance xoc drought whereas mpkkrna interference rnai plant increased sensitivity xoc drought mpkk physically interacted mpk mpk phosphorylated two mapks vivo transcriptionally modulating mpkk influenced mpk phosphorylation ricexoc interaction mpkkoempkrnai double mutant showed increased sensitivity xoc mpkkoempkrnai double mutant showed survival rate similar control plant although survival rate mpkk transgenic plant changed drought stress result suggest mpkk node involved rice response biotic abiotic response functioning crosspoint two mapk cascade leading xoc resistance drought tolerance,2,"{'Disease': ['bacterial streak disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
30919975,Importance of OsRac1 and RAI1 in signalling of nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.,"Plants depend on Resistance (R) genes, most of which encode nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, for pathogen race-specific disease resistance. However, only a few immediate downstream targets of R proteins have been characterized, and the signalling pathways for R-protein-induced immunity are largely unknown. In rice (Oryza sativa), NLR proteins serve as important immune receptors in the response to rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We used site-directed mutagenesis to create an autoactive form of the NLR protein PID3 that confers blast resistance and used transgenic rice to test the resulting immunity and gene expression changes. We identified OsRac1, a known GTPase, as a signalling molecule in PID3-mediated blast resistance, implicating OsRac1 as a possible common factor downstream of rice NLR proteins. We also identified RAI1, a transcriptional activator, as a PID3 interactor required for PID3-mediated blast resistance and showed that RAI1 expression is induced by PID3 via a process mediated by OsRac1. This study describes a new signalling pathway for NLR protein-mediated blast resistance and shows that OsRac1 and RAI1 act together to play a critical role in this process.",plant depend resistance r gene encode nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat nlr protein pathogen racespecific disease resistance however immediate downstream target r protein characterized signalling pathway rproteininduced immunity largely unknown rice oryza sativa nlr protein serve important immune receptor response rice blast disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae used sitedirected mutagenesis create autoactive form nlr protein pid confers blast resistance used transgenic rice test resulting immunity gene expression change identified osrac known gtpase signalling molecule pidmediated blast resistance implicating osrac possible common factor downstream rice nlr protein also identified rai transcriptional activator pid interactor required pidmediated blast resistance showed rai expression induced pid via process mediated osrac study describes new signalling pathway nlr proteinmediated blast resistance show osrac rai act together play critical role process,4,"{'Disease': ['important immune receptor response rice blast disease', 'fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
22158700,A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease.,"Bacterial blight is a devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Zinc finger proteins harboring the motif with three conserved cysteine residues and one histidine residue (CCCH) belong to a large family. Although at least 67 CCCH-type zinc finger protein genes have been identified in the rice genome, their functions are poorly understood. Here, we report that one of the rice CCCH-type zinc finger proteins, C3H12, containing five typical CX(8)-CX(5)-CX(3)-H zinc finger motifs, is involved in the rice-Xoo interaction. Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice. In contrast, knockout or suppression of C3H12 resulted in partially increased susceptibility to Xoo, accompanied by decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes in rice. C3H12 colocalized with a minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus to Xoo, and the enhanced resistance of randomly chosen plants in the quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated with an increased expression level of C3H12. The C3H12 protein localized in the nucleus and possessed nucleic acid-binding activity in vitro. These results suggest that C3H12, as a nucleic acid-binding protein, positively and quantitatively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and that its function is likely associated with the JA-dependent pathway.",bacterial blight devastating disease rice oryza sativa caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo zinc finger protein harboring motif three conserved cysteine residue one histidine residue ccch belong large family although least ccchtype zinc finger protein gene identified rice genome function poorly understood report one rice ccchtype zinc finger protein ch containing five typical cxcxcxh zinc finger motif involved ricexoo interaction activation ch partially enhanced resistance xoo accompanied accumulation jasmonic acid ja induced expression ja signaling gene rice contrast knockout suppression ch resulted partially increased susceptibility xoo accompanied decreased level ja expression ja signaling gene rice ch colocalized minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus xoo enhanced resistance randomly chosen plant quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated increased expression level ch ch protein localized nucleus possessed nucleic acidbinding activity vitro result suggest ch nucleic acidbinding protein positively quantitatively regulates rice resistance xoo function likely associated jadependent pathway,2,"{'Disease': ['bacterial blight devastating disease rice oryza sativa', 'minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus xoo enhanced resistance randomly chosen plant quantitative trait locus mapping population'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3

37807096,An Efficient Method for Screening Rice Breeding Lines Against Races of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.,"Rice blast, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most destructive rice disease worldwide. The disease symptoms are usually expressed on the leaf and panicle. The leaf disease intensity in controlled environmental conditions is frequently quantified using a 0 to 5 scale, where 0 represents the absence of symptoms, and 5 represents large eyespot lesions. However, this scale restricts the qualitative classification of the varieties into intermediate resistant and susceptible categories. Here, we develop a 0 to 6 scale for blast disease that allows proper assignment of rice breeding lines and varieties into six resistance levels (highly resistant, resistant, moderately resistant, moderately susceptible, susceptible, and highly susceptible). We evaluated 40 common rice varieties against four major blast races (IB1, IB17, IB49, and IE1-K). Varieties carrying the <i>Pi-ta</i> gene were either highly resistant, resistant, or moderately resistant to IB17. The IE1-K race was able to break <i>Pi-ta</i>-mediated resistance of the rice varieties. The <i>Pi-z</i> gene conferred resistance to the IB17 and IE1-K races. The varieties M201, Cheniere, and Frontier were highly susceptible (score 6; 100% disease) to the race IE1-K. Moreover, varieties that were resistant or susceptible to all four blast races also showed similar levels of resistance/susceptibility to blast disease in the field.

16290216,Towards molecular breeding and improvement of rice in China.,"China is the largest producer and consumer of rice in the world and a pioneer in applying hybrid rice technology. Although hybrid rice has contributed greatly to Chinese agriculture in the past decades, its potential to improve grain quality further is being questioned. However, to meet the challenges posed by severe crop damage by pests and diseases, the extensive use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, and a shortage of water and energy, more elite rice cultivars are needed. In recent years, China has seen continued improvements in rice genetics, powered by functional genomics as a way forward to safeguard its rice production. Here, we briefly review the current status of rice breeding in China through strategies integrating hybrid rice technology, molecular marker-assisted breeding, functional genomics and genetically modified rice.",china largest producer consumer rice world pioneer applying hybrid rice technology although hybrid rice contributed greatly chinese agriculture past decade potential improve grain quality questioned however meet challenge posed severe crop damage pest disease extensive use pesticide chemical fertilizer shortage water energy elite rice cultivar needed recent year china seen continued improvement rice genetics powered functional genomics way forward safeguard rice production briefly review current status rice breeding china strategy integrating hybrid rice technology molecular markerassisted breeding functional genomics genetically modified rice,2,"{'Disease': ['severe crop damage pest disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
30857220,Every Coin Has Two Sides: Reactive Oxygen Species during Rice⁻<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Interaction.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in many important processes, including the growth, development, and responses to the environments, in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. Although ROS are known to be critical components in rice⁻<i>M. oryzae</i> interactions, their regulations and pathways have not yet been completely revealed. Recent studies have provided fascinating insights into the intricate physiological redox balance in rice⁻<i>M. oryzae</i> interactions. In <i>M. oryzae</i>, ROS accumulation is required for the appressorium formation and penetration. However, once inside the rice cells, <i>M. oryzae</i> must scavenge the host-derived ROS to spread invasive hyphae. On the other side, ROS play key roles in rice against <i>M. oryzae</i>. It has been known that, upon perception of <i>M. oryzae</i>, rice plants modulate their activities of ROS generating and scavenging enzymes, mainly on NADPH oxidase OsRbohB, by different signaling pathways to accumulate ROS against rice blast. By contrast, the <i>M. oryzae</i> virulent strains are capable of suppressing ROS accumulation and attenuating rice blast resistance by the secretion of effectors, such as AvrPii and AvrPiz-t. These results suggest that ROS generation and scavenging of ROS are tightly controlled by different pathways in both <i>M. oryzae</i> and rice during rice blast. In this review, the most recent advances in the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ROS accumulation and signaling during rice⁻<i>M. oryzae</i> interaction are summarized.",reactive oxygen specie ro involved many important process including growth development response environment rice ioryza sativai imagnaporthe oryzaei although ro known critical component rice⁻im oryzaei interaction regulation pathway yet completely revealed recent study provided fascinating insight intricate physiological redox balance rice⁻im oryzaei interaction im oryzaei ro accumulation required appressorium formation penetration however inside rice cell im oryzaei must scavenge hostderived ro spread invasive hypha side ro play key role rice im oryzaei known upon perception im oryzaei rice plant modulate activity ro generating scavenging enzyme mainly nadph oxidase osrbohb different signaling pathway accumulate ro rice blast contrast im oryzaei virulent strain capable suppressing ro accumulation attenuating rice blast resistance secretion effector avrpii avrpizt result suggest ro generation scavenging ro tightly controlled different pathway im oryzaei rice rice blast review recent advance understanding regulatory mechanism ro accumulation signaling rice⁻im oryzaei interaction summarized,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['rice blast resistance secretion effector avrpii avrpizt result']}",1
37871165,Characterization of Rice-<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Interactions by Hyperspectral Imaging.,"Hyperspectral imaging has the potential to detect, characterize, and quantify plant diseases objectively and nondestructively to improve phenotyping in breeding for disease resistance. In this study, leaf spectral reflectance characteristics of five rice genotypes diseased with blast caused by three <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> isolates differing in virulence were compared with visual disease ratings under greenhouse conditions. Spectral information (140 wavebands, range 450 to 850 nm) of infected leaves was recorded with a hyperspectral imaging microscope at 3, 5, and 7 days postinoculation to examine differences in symptom phenotypes and to characterize the compatibility of host-pathogen interactions. Depending on the rice genotype × <i>M. oryzae</i> genotype interaction, blast symptoms varied from tiny necrosis to enlarged lesions with symptom subareas differing in tissue coloration and indicated gene-for-gene-specific interactions. The blast symptom types were differentiated based on their spectral characteristics in the visible/near-infrared range. Symptom-specific spectral signatures and differences in the composition of leaf blast symptom type(s) resulted in unique spectral and spatial patterns of the rice × <i>M. oryzae</i> interactions based on the size, shape, and color of the symptom subareas. Spectral angle mapper classification of spectra enabled (i) discrimination between healthy (green) and diseased tissue of rice genotypes, (ii) classification and quantification of different blast symptom subareas, and (iii) grading of the host-pathogen compatibility (low - intermediate - high).

17645814,Induced resistance in rice against insects.,"Vaccinations are the mainstay of western preventive medicine, and they have been used to protect some crops against disease and insect pests. We consider rice as a model for protection using induced resistance since it is one of the most important staple crops and there have been significant new developments in: cross-resistance among rice insects, chemical pathways involved in induced resistance, sequencing the rice genome and expression of genes conferring resistance against rice insect pests. Insect attack has been found to cause lesions that kill planthopper eggs and early stages of gall midges. Damaged plants released volatiles that made them less likely to be chosen by planthoppers and more attractive to parasitoids. Chemical elicitors have been developed for dicotyledonous plants and these can induce resistance in rice, although rice does not fit models developed to explain signalling in dicots. For example, salicylic acid did not increase in rice after infection by pathogens and did not appear to be the mobile signal for induced resistance against pathogens although it was involved in induced responses to phloem-feeding insects. Jasmonic acid acted as a signal in some induced responses to pathogens as well as chewing insects. Many of the genes associated with induced resistance in rice have recently been mapped, and techniques are being developed to incorporate them into the genome of cultivated varieties. Attempts to control insect pests of rice will affect interactions with pathogens, predators and parasites, and other organisms in this agroecosystem.",vaccination mainstay western preventive medicine used protect crop disease insect pest consider rice model protection using induced resistance since one important staple crop significant new development crossresistance among rice insect chemical pathway involved induced resistance sequencing rice genome expression gene conferring resistance rice insect pest insect attack found cause lesion kill planthopper egg early stage gall midge damaged plant released volatile made less likely chosen planthopper attractive parasitoids chemical elicitors developed dicotyledonous plant induce resistance rice although rice fit model developed explain signalling dicot example salicylic acid increase rice infection pathogen appear mobile signal induced resistance pathogen although involved induced response phloemfeeding insect jasmonic acid acted signal induced response pathogen well chewing insect many gene associated induced resistance rice recently mapped technique developed incorporate genome cultivated variety attempt control insect pest rice affect interaction pathogen predator parasite organism agroecosystem,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0

It reduces the risk of many deadly diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, etc. Brown rice is an example of whole grain food, which is highly nutritious due to the presence of various bioactive compounds (flavonoids, phenolics, vitamins, phytosterols, oils, etc.) associated with the rice bran layer of brown rice. White rice is devoid of the nutritious rice bran layer and thus lacks the bioactive compounds which are the major attractants of brown rice. Therefore, to confer health benefits to the public at large, the nutrigenomic potential of white rice may be improved by integrating the phytochemicals associated with the rice bran layer of brown rice into it via biofortification processes like conventional breeding, agronomic practices, metabolic engineering, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and RNAi techniques.

37256700,"Engineering Climate-Resilient Rice Using a Nanobiostimulant-Based ""Stress Training"" Strategy.","Under a changing climate, cultivating climate-resilient crops will be critical to maintaining food security. Here, we propose the application of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating nanoparticles as nanobiostimulants to trigger stress/immune responses and subsequently increase the stress resilience of plants. We established three regimens of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-based ""stress training"": seed training (ST), leaf training (LT), and combined seed and leaf training (SLT). Trained rice seedlings were then exposed to either rice blast fungus (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) or chilling stress (10 °C). The results show that all ""stress training"" regimes, particularly SLT, significantly enhanced the resistance of rice against the fungal pathogen (lesion size reduced by 82% relative to untrained control). SLT also significantly enhanced rice tolerance to cold stress. The mechanisms for the enhanced resilience were investigated with metabolomics and transcriptomics, which show that ""stress training"" induced considerable metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming in rice leaves. AgNPs boosted ROS-activated stress signaling pathways by oxidative post-translational modifications of stress-related kinases, hormones, and transcriptional factors (TFs). These signaling pathways subsequently modulated the expression of defense genes, including specialized metabolites (SMs) biosynthesis genes, cell membrane lipid metabolism genes, and pathogen-plant interaction genes. Importantly, results showed that the ""stress memory"" can be transferred transgenerationally, conferring offspring seeds with improved seed germination and seedling vigor. This may provide an epigenetic breeding strategy to fortify stress resilience of crops. This nanobiostimulant-based stress training strategy will increase yield vigor against a changing climate and will contribute to sustainable agriculture by reducing agrochemical use.",changing climate cultivating climateresilient crop critical maintaining food security propose application reactive oxygen specie rosgenerating nanoparticles nanobiostimulants trigger stressimmune response subsequently increase stress resilience plant established three regimen silver nanoparticles agnpsbased stress training seed training st leaf training lt combined seed leaf training slt trained rice seedling exposed either rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei chilling stress °c result show stress training regime particularly slt significantly enhanced resistance rice fungal pathogen lesion size reduced relative untrained control slt also significantly enhanced rice tolerance cold stress mechanism enhanced resilience investigated metabolomics transcriptomics show stress training induced considerable metabolic transcriptional reprogramming rice leaf agnps boosted rosactivated stress signaling pathway oxidative posttranslational modification stressrelated kinase hormone transcriptional factor tfs signaling pathway subsequently modulated expression defense gene including specialized metabolite sm biosynthesis gene cell membrane lipid metabolism gene pathogenplant interaction gene importantly result showed stress memory transferred transgenerationally conferring offspring seed improved seed germination seedling vigor may provide epigenetic breeding strategy fortify stress resilience crop nanobiostimulantbased stress training strategy increase yield vigor changing climate contribute sustainable agriculture reducing agrochemical use,2,"{'Disease': ['either rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei chilling stress'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

Usually, the single copy OsGLP1 gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues. The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous OsGLP1 expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant. Structural homology modeling predicted a superoxide dismutase (SOD) domain in OsGLP1 protein which upon over-expression in transgenic tobacco plant clearly documented SOD activity.

27701783,Activation of ethylene signaling pathways enhances disease resistance by regulating ROS and phytoalexin production in rice.,"Ethylene plays diverse roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. However, the roles of ethylene signaling in immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae infection activated ethylene biosynthesis in rice. Resistant rice cultivars accumulated higher levels of ethylene than susceptible ones. Ethylene signaling components OsEIN2 and the downstream transcription factor OsEIL1 positively regulated disease resistance. Mutation of OsEIN2 led to enhanced disease susceptibility. Whole-genome transcription analysis revealed that responsive genes of ethylene, jasmonates (JAs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling as well as phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were remarkably induced. Transcription of OsrbohA/B, which encode NADPH oxidases, and OsOPRs, the JA biosynthesis genes, were induced by M. oryzae infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsEIL1 binds to the promoters of OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR4 to activate their expression. These data suggest that OsEIN2-mediated OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR transcription may play essential roles in ROS generation, JA biosynthesis and the subsequent phytoalexin accumulation. Therefore, the involvement of ethylene signaling in disease resistance is probably by activation of ROS and phytoalexin production in rice during M. oryzae infection.",ethylene play diverse role plant growth development stress response however role ethylene signaling immune response remain largely unknown study showed blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae infection activated ethylene biosynthesis rice resistant rice cultivar accumulated higher level ethylene susceptible one ethylene signaling component osein downstream transcription factor oseil positively regulated disease resistance mutation osein led enhanced disease susceptibility wholegenome transcription analysis revealed responsive gene ethylene jasmonates jas reactive oxygen specie ro signaling well phytoalexin biosynthesis gene remarkably induced transcription osrbohab encode nadph oxidase osoprs ja biosynthesis gene induced oryzae infection furthermore demonstrated oseil bind promoter osrbohaosrbohb osopr activate expression data suggest oseinmediated osrbohaosrbohb osopr transcription may play essential role ro generation ja biosynthesis subsequent phytoalexin accumulation therefore involvement ethylene signaling disease resistance probably activation ro phytoalexin production rice oryzae infection,2,"{'Disease': ['blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae infection activated ethylene biosynthesis rice resistant rice cultivar', 'positively regulated disease resistance mutation osein', 'enhanced disease susceptibility wholegenome transcription analysis', 'ethylene signaling disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
34739330,Mapping Blast Resistance Genes in Rice Varieties 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202'.,"Rice blast caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (syn. <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i>) is one of the most lethal diseases for sustainable rice production worldwide. Blast resistance mediated by major resistance genes is often broken down after a short period of deployment, while minor blast resistance genes, each providing a small effect on disease reactions, are more durable. In the present study, we first evaluated disease reactions of two rice breeding parents 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202' with 11 blast races, IA45, IB1, IB45, IB49, IB54, IC1, IC17, ID1, IE1, IG1, and IH1, commonly present in the United States, under greenhouse conditions using a category disease rating resembling infection types under field conditions. 'Minghui 63' exhibited differential resistance responses in comparison with those of 'M-202' to the tested blast races. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 275 lines from a cross between 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202' was also evaluated with the above-mentioned blast races. The population was genotyped with 156 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and insertion and deletion (Indel) markers. A linkage map with a genetic distance of 1,022.84 cM was constructed using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) software. A total of 10 resistance QTLs, eight from 'Minghui 63' and two from 'M-202', were identified. One major QTL, <i>qBLAST2</i> on chromosome 2, was identified by seven races/isolates.

Both healthy and neck-blast-infected panicles of three aromatic rice cultivars (high-yielding and local) were collected and investigated at Plant Pathology Division, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), Gazipur, Bangladesh. All of the tested varieties were highly susceptible to neck blast disease under natural conditions, though no leaf blast symptoms appear on leaves. Neck blast disease increased grain sterility percentages, reduced grain size, yield and quality traits of seeds. The degrees of yield and seed quality reduction depended on disease severity and variety's genetic make-up. Unfilled grains were the main source of seed-borne pathogen, especially for blast in the seed lot. Transmission of blast pathogen from neck (panicle base) to seed was very poor. These findings are important, especially concerning the seed certification programme in which seed lots are certified on the basis of field inspection.

26198760,Genetic analysis and molecular mapping of QTLs for resistance to rice black-streaked dwarf disease in rice.,"Rice black-streaked dwarf disease, caused by rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), is transmitted by small brown planthoppers (Laodelphax striatellus Fallén, SBPH) and causes severe yield loss in epidemic years in China and other East Asian countries. Breeding for resistance to RBSDV is a promising strategy to control the disease. We identified Tetep that showed resistance to RBSDV using a field test and artificial inoculation test. An evaluation of the resistance mechanism revealed that Tetep was resistant to RBSDV but not to SBPH. Genetic analysis showed that the resistance of Tetep to RBSDV was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Three new QTLs for RBSDV resistance were identified in this study, i.e., qRBSDV-3, qRBSDV-10 and qRBSDV-11. The LOD scores of qRBSDV-3, qRBSDV-10 and qRBSDV-11 were 4.07, 2.24 and 2.21, accounting for 17.5%, 0.3% and 12.4% of the total phenotypic variation, respectively. All the resistance loci identified in this study were associated with virus resistance genes. The alleles for enhancing resistance on chromosomes 3 and 11 originated from Tetep, whereas the other allele on chromosome 10 originated from a susceptible parent.

27905546,Transcriptome analysis confers a complex disease resistance network in wild rice Oryza meyeriana against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"Rice bacterial blight (BB), caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is one of the devastating diseases of rice. It is well established that the wild rice Oryza meyeriana is immune to BB. In this study, the transcriptomic analysis was carried out by RNA sequencing of O. meyeriana leaves, inoculated with Xoo to understand the transcriptional responses and interaction between the host and pathogen. Totally, 57,313 unitranscripts were de novo assembled from 58.7 Gb clean reads and 14,143 unitranscripts were identified after Xoo inoculation. The significant metabolic pathways related to the disease resistance enriched by KEGG, were revealed to plant-pathogen interaction, phytohormone signaling, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Further, many disease resistance genes were also identified to be differentially expressed in response to Xoo infection. Conclusively, the present study indicated that the induced innate immunity comprise the basal defence frontier of O. meyeriana against Xoo infection. And then, the resistance genes are activated. Simultaneously, the other signaling transduction pathways like phytohormones and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis may contribute to the disease defence through modulation of the disease-related genes or pathways. This could be an useful information for further investigating the molecular mechanism associated with disease resistance in O. meyeriana.",rice bacterial blight bb caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo one devastating disease rice well established wild rice oryza meyeriana immune bb study transcriptomic analysis carried rna sequencing meyeriana leaf inoculated xoo understand transcriptional response interaction host pathogen totally unitranscripts de novo assembled gb clean read unitranscripts identified xoo inoculation significant metabolic pathway related disease resistance enriched kegg revealed plantpathogen interaction phytohormone signaling ubiquitin mediated proteolysis phenylpropanoid biosynthesis many disease resistance gene also identified differentially expressed response xoo infection conclusively present study indicated induced innate immunity comprise basal defence frontier meyeriana xoo infection resistance gene activated simultaneously signaling transduction pathway like phytohormone ubiquitin mediated proteolysis may contribute disease defence modulation diseaserelated gene pathway could useful information investigating molecular mechanism associated disease resistance meyeriana,2,"{'Disease': ['one devastating disease rice', 'xoo inoculation significant metabolic pathway related disease resistance enriched kegg', 'many disease resistance gene', 'disease defence modulation diseaserelated gene pathway', 'molecular mechanism associated disease resistance meyeriana'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
25616388,XA23 is an executor R protein and confers broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.,"The majority of plant disease resistance (R) genes encode proteins that share common structural features. However, the transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-associated executor type R genes show no considerable sequence homology to any known R genes. We adopted a map-based cloning approach and TALE-based technology to isolate and characterize Xa23, a new executor R gene derived from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) that confers an extremely broad spectrum of resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Xa23 encodes a 113 amino acid protein that shares 50% identity with the known executor R protein XA10. The predicted transmembrane helices in XA23 also overlap with those of XA10. Unlike Xa10, however, Xa23 transcription is specifically activated by AvrXa23, a TALE present in all examined Xoo field isolates. Moreover, the susceptible xa23 allele has an identical open reading frame of Xa23 but differs in promoter region by lacking the TALE binding element (EBE) for AvrXa23. XA23 can trigger a strong hypersensitive response in rice, tobacco, and tomato.

26513164,Progress and challenges in improving the nutritional quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Rice is a staple food for more than 3 billion people in more than 100 countries of the world but ironically it is deficient in many bioavailable vitamins, minerals, essential amino- and fatty-acids and phytochemicals that prevent chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and obesity. To enhance the nutritional and other quality aspects of rice, a better understanding of the regulation of the processes involved in the synthesis, uptake, transport, and metabolism of macro-(starch, seed storage protein and lipid) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals) is required. With the publication of high quality genomic sequence of rice, significant progress has been made in identification, isolation, and characterization of novel genes and their regulation for the nutritional and quality enhancement of rice. During the last decade, numerous efforts have been made to refine the nutritional and other quality traits either by using the traditional breeding with high through put technologies such as marker assisted selection and breeding, or by adopting the transgenic approach. A significant improvement in vitamins (A, folate, and E), mineral (iron), essential amino acid (lysine), and flavonoids levels has been achieved in the edible part of rice, i.e., endosperm (biofortification) to meet the daily dietary allowance. However, studies on bioavailability and allergenicity on biofortified rice are still required. Despite the numerous efforts, the commercialization of biofortified rice has not yet been achieved.

16798873,Os8N3 is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice.,"Many bacterial diseases of plants depend on the interaction of type III effector genes of the pathogen and disease-susceptibility genes of the host. The host susceptibility genes are largely unknown. Here, we show that expression of the rice gene Os8N3, a member of the MtN3 gene family from plants and animals, is elevated upon infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99(A) and depends on the type III effector gene pthXo1. Os8N3 resides near xa13, and PXO99(A) failed to induce Os8N3 in rice lines with xa13. Silencing of Os8N3 by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99(A) yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen. The effector gene avrXa7 from strain PXO86 enabled PXO99(A) compatibility on either xa13- or Os8N3-silenced plants. The findings indicate that Os8N3 is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1. The results support the hypothesis that X. oryzae pv. oryzae commandeers the regulation of otherwise developmentally regulated host genes to induce a state of disease susceptibility. Furthermore, the results support a model in which the pathogen induces disease susceptibility in a gene-for-gene manner.",many bacterial disease plant depend interaction type iii effector gene pathogen diseasesusceptibility gene host host susceptibility gene largely unknown show expression rice gene osn member mtn gene family plant animal elevated upon infection xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae strain pxoa depends type iii effector gene pthxo osn resides near xa pxoa failed induce osn rice line xa silencing osn inhibitory rna produced plant resistant infection strain pxoa yet remained susceptible strain pathogen effector gene avrxa strain pxo enabled pxoa compatibility either xa osnsilenced plant finding indicate osn host susceptibility gene bacterial blight targeted type iii effector pthxo result support hypothesis x oryzae pv oryzae commandeers regulation otherwise developmentally regulated host gene induce state disease susceptibility furthermore result support model pathogen induces disease susceptibility geneforgene manner,4,"{'Disease': ['many bacterial disease plant', 'diseasesusceptibility gene host host susceptibility gene', 'state disease susceptibility', 'disease susceptibility geneforgene manner'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['interaction type iii effector gene', 'type iii effector gene pthxo osn', 'susceptible strain pathogen effector gene avrxa strain pxo', 'osn host susceptibility gene bacterial blight targeted type iii effector pthxo']}",2

However, the molecular basis of lesion mimic formation remains largely unknown. Here, we first used a proteomic approach to identify differentially expressed proteins during dynamic lesion mimic formation in the rice oscul3a mutant, then electron microscope observation and physiological assays were used to analyze the mutant. The oscul3a mutant had disrupted cell metabolism balance, and the identified differentially expressed proteins were mainly located in the chloroplast and cytoplasm, which caused enhanced lipid metabolism, but suppressed carbon/nitrogen metabolism with reduced growth and grain quality. The oscul3a mutant had higher salicylic acid (SA) concentration in leaves, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was shown to accumulate late in the formation of lesions. The secondary metabolite coumarin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and had rice blast resistance activity. Moreover, the cell death initiated lesion mimic formation of oscul3a mutant was light-sensitive, which might be associated with metabolite biosynthesis and accumulation. This study sheds light on the metabolic transition associated with cell death and defense response, which is under tight regulation by OsCUL3a and metabolism-related proteins, and the newly identified chemicals in the secondary metabolic pathway can potentially be used to control disease in crop plants.",lesion mimic mutant ideal genetic material study programmed cell death defense signaling plant however molecular basis lesion mimic formation remains largely unknown first used proteomic approach identify differentially expressed protein dynamic lesion mimic formation rice oscula mutant electron microscope observation physiological assay used analyze mutant oscula mutant disrupted cell metabolism balance identified differentially expressed protein mainly located chloroplast cytoplasm caused enhanced lipid metabolism suppressed carbonnitrogen metabolism reduced growth grain quality oscula mutant higher salicylic acid sa concentration leaf hsubsubosubsub shown accumulate late formation lesion secondary metabolite coumarin induced reactive oxygen specie ro rice blast resistance activity moreover cell death initiated lesion mimic formation oscula mutant lightsensitive might associated metabolite biosynthesis accumulation study shed light metabolic transition associated cell death defense response tight regulation oscula metabolismrelated protein newly identified chemical secondary metabolic pathway potentially used control disease crop plant,2,"{'Disease': ['control disease crop plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

Conidia are very important infectious propagules of U. virens, but the ability of pathogenic isolates to produce conidia frequently decreases in culture, which influences pathogenicity testing. Here, we developed tissue media with rice leaves or panicles that stimulate conidiation of U. virens. Among the tested media, 0.10 g/ml panicle medium was most efficient for conidiation. Whereas, some rice leaf media more effectively increased conidiation than panicle media except 0.10 g/ml panicle medium, and certain non-filtered tissue media were better than their filtered counterparts. Although the conidia induced in rice tissue media were smaller, they were able to germinate on potato sucrose agar medium and infect rice normally. The rice tissue medium is also workable in inducing conidia for conidiation-defective isolates. This method provides a foundation for the production of conidia by U. virens that will be widely applicable in pathogenicity testing as well as in genetic analyses for false smut resistance in rice cultivars.",rice false smut caused ascomycete ustilaginoidea virens serious disease rice worldwide conidium important infectious propagules u virens ability pathogenic isolates produce conidium frequently decrease culture influence pathogenicity testing developed tissue medium rice leaf panicle stimulate conidiation u virens among tested medium gml panicle medium efficient conidiation whereas rice leaf medium effectively increased conidiation panicle medium except gml panicle medium certain nonfiltered tissue medium better filtered counterpart although conidium induced rice tissue medium smaller able germinate potato sucrose agar medium infect rice normally rice tissue medium also workable inducing conidium conidiationdefective isolates method provides foundation production conidium u virens widely applicable pathogenicity testing well genetic analysis false smut resistance rice cultivar,2,"{'Disease': ['serious disease rice'], 'Treatment': ['also workable inducing conidium conidiationdefective isolates method'], 'Symptom': []}",1
28418377,The Magnaporthe oryzae nitrooxidative stress response suppresses rice innate immunity during blast disease.,"Understanding how microorganisms manipulate plant innate immunity and colonize host cells is a major goal of plant pathology. Here, we report that the fungal nitrooxidative stress response suppresses host defences to facilitate the growth and development of the important rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in leaf cells. Nitronate monooxygenases encoded by NMO genes catalyse the oxidative denitrification of nitroalkanes. We show that the M. oryzae NMO2 gene is required for mitigating damaging lipid nitration under nitrooxidative stress conditions and, consequently, for using nitrate and nitrite as nitrogen sources. On plants, the Δnmo2 mutant strain penetrated host cuticles like wild type, but invasive hyphal growth in rice cells was restricted and elicited plant immune responses that included the formation of cellular deposits and a host reactive oxygen species burst. Development of the M. oryzae effector-secreting biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) was misregulated in the Δnmo2 mutant. Inhibiting or quenching host reactive oxygen species suppressed rice innate immune responses and allowed the Δnmo2 mutant to grow and develop normally in infected cells. NMO2 is thus essential for mitigating nitrooxidative cellular damage and, in rice cells, maintaining redox balance to avoid triggering plant defences that impact M. oryzae growth and BIC development.",understanding microorganism manipulate plant innate immunity colonize host cell major goal plant pathology report fungal nitrooxidative stress response suppresses host defence facilitate growth development important rice pathogen magnaporthe oryzae leaf cell nitronate monooxygenases encoded nmo gene catalyse oxidative denitrification nitroalkanes show oryzae nmo gene required mitigating damaging lipid nitration nitrooxidative stress condition consequently using nitrate nitrite nitrogen source plant δnmo mutant strain penetrated host cuticle like wild type invasive hyphal growth rice cell restricted elicited plant immune response included formation cellular deposit host reactive oxygen specie burst development oryzae effectorsecreting biotrophic interfacial complex bic misregulated δnmo mutant inhibiting quenching host reactive oxygen specie suppressed rice innate immune response allowed δnmo mutant grow develop normally infected cell nmo thus essential mitigating nitrooxidative cellular damage rice cell maintaining redox balance avoid triggering plant defence impact oryzae growth bic development,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['plant defence impact']}",4
35592995,A secreted fungal effector suppresses rice immunity through host histone hypoacetylation.,"Histone acetylation is a critical epigenetic modification that regulates plant immunity. Fungal pathogens secrete effectors that modulate host immunity and facilitate infection, but whether fungal pathogens have evolved effectors that directly target plant histone acetylation remains unknown. Here, we identified a secreted protein, UvSec117, from the rice false smut fungus, Ustilaginoidea virens, as a key effector that can target the rice histone deacetylase OsHDA701 and negatively regulates rice broad-spectrum resistance against rice pathogens. UvSec117 disrupts host immunity by recruiting OsHDA701 to the nucleus and enhancing OsHDA701-modulated deacetylation, thereby reducing histone H3K9 acetylation levels in rice plants and interfering with defense gene activation. Host-induced gene silencing of UvSec117 promotes rice resistance to U. virens, thus providing an alternative way for developing rice false smut-resistant plants.

Green fluorescent protein-fused OsWRKY76 localized to the nuclei in rice epidermal cells. OsWRKY76 showed sequence-specific DNA binding to the W-box element in vitro and exhibited W-box-mediated transcriptional repressor activity in cultured rice cells. Overexpression of OsWRKY76 in rice plants resulted in drastically increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, but improved tolerance to cold stress. Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non-transformed control plants. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress-associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes.

In this study, we selected two rice cultivars based on their resistance to the pathogen and analyzed and compared the transcriptomic profiles of two cultivars, the moderately resistant variety Gangyuan8 and the highly susceptible variety Yanfeng47, at different time points after inoculation. The comparative transcriptome profiling showed that the expression of related genes gradually increased after pathogen inoculation. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Yanfeng47 was higher than that in Gangyuan8, and this result revealed that Yanfeng47 was more susceptible to fungal attack. At the early stage (24 and 48 h), the accumulation of resistance genes and a resistance metabolism occurred earlier in Ganguan8 than in Yanfeng47, and the resistance enrichment entries were more abundant in Ganguan8 than in Yanfeng47. Based on the GO and KEGG enrichment analyses at five infection stages, we concluded that phenylalanine metabolism and the jasmonic acid pathway play a crucial role in the resistance of rice to sheath blight.

Although both japonica and indica varieties have been grown in Japan, now japonica rices are grown. Japanese rice breeding has used an ecological breeding approach. While emphasis in rice breeding in the 1940's and 1950's focussed on yield in recent decades quality has been of major importance. Consumer preference and name recognition of high quality varieties, such as Koshihikari, has resulted in slow acceptance of new varieties. Rice germplasm was systematically collected throughout Japan between 1962 and 1963. Subsequent acquisition and collecting, in Japan and other countries, has resulted in 28,000 accessions being conserved in the National Genebank, based at the National institute of Agrobiological Resources (NIAR). Research on genetic diversity of rice using a range of techniques, for example esterase isozymes, has revealed clinal variation in rice radiating from the center of diversity of rice in and around southwest China. Newly found genes in traditional rice germplasm, such as genes for non-elongating mesocotyl, are now routinely identified on the rice genome.

17910117,"Characterizing and estimating rice brown spot disease severity using stepwise regression, principal component regression and partial least-square regression.","Detecting plant health conditions plays a key role in farm pest management and crop protection. In this study, measurement of hyperspectral leaf reflectance in rice crop (Oryzasativa L.) was conducted on groups of healthy and infected leaves by the fungus Bipolaris oryzae (Helminthosporium oryzae Breda. de Hann) through the wavelength range from 350 to 2,500 nm. The percentage of leaf surface lesions was estimated and defined as the disease severity. Statistical methods like multiple stepwise regression, principal component analysis and partial least-square regression were utilized to calculate and estimate the disease severity of rice brown spot at the leaf level. Our results revealed that multiple stepwise linear regressions could efficiently estimate disease severity with three wavebands in seven steps. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) for training (n=210) and testing (n=53) dataset were 6.5% and 5.8%, respectively. Principal component analysis showed that the first principal component could explain approximately 80% of the variance of the original hyperspectral reflectance.

26364119,Current Status of Proteomic Studies on Defense Responses in Rice.,"Biotic stresses are constraints to plant growth and development negatively impacting crop production. To counter such stresses, plants have developed stress-specific adaptations as well as simultaneous responses. The efficacy and magnitude of inducible adaptive responses are dependent on activation of signaling pathways and intracellular networks by modulating expression, or abundance, and/or post-translational modification of proteins associated with defense mechanisms. Proteomics plays an important role in elucidating plant defense mechanisms by mining the differential regulation of proteins to various biotic stresses. Rice, one of the most widely cultivated food crops in world, is constantly challenged by a variety of biotic stresses, and high-throughput proteomics approaches have been employed to unravel the molecular mechanism of the biotic stresses-response in rice. In this review, we summarize the latest advances of proteomic studies on defense responses and discuss the potential relevance of the proteins identified by proteomic means in rice defense mechanism. Furthermore, we provide perspective for proteomics in unraveling the molecular mechanism of rice immunity.",biotic stress constraint plant growth development negatively impacting crop production counter stress plant developed stressspecific adaptation well simultaneous response efficacy magnitude inducible adaptive response dependent activation signaling pathway intracellular network modulating expression abundance andor posttranslational modification protein associated defense mechanism proteomics play important role elucidating plant defense mechanism mining differential regulation protein various biotic stress rice one widely cultivated food crop world constantly challenged variety biotic stress highthroughput proteomics approach employed unravel molecular mechanism biotic stressesresponse rice review summarize latest advance proteomic study defense response discus potential relevance protein identified proteomic mean rice defense mechanism furthermore provide perspective proteomics unraveling molecular mechanism rice immunity,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

Here, we report that a rice valine-glutamine (VQ) motif-containing protein, OsVQ25, balances broad-spectrum disease resistance and plant growth by interacting with a U-Box E3 ligase, OsPUB73, and a transcription factor, OsWRKY53. We show that OsPUB73 positively regulates rice resistance against M. oryzae and Xoo by interacting with and promoting OsVQ25 degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. Knockout mutants of OsVQ25 exhibit enhanced resistance to both pathogens without a growth penalty. Furthermore, OsVQ25 interacts with and suppresses the transcriptional activity of OsWRKY53, a positive regulator of plant immunity. OsWRKY53 downstream defense-related genes and brassinosteroid signaling genes are upregulated in osvq25 mutants.

22607456,Identification of positive and negative regulators of disease resistance to rice blast fungus using constitutive gene expression patterns.,"Elevated constitutive expression of components of the defence arsenal is associated with quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, a phenomenon called preformed defence. While the role of many disease regulators in inducible defence systems has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid so far to genes that regulate preformed defence. In this study, we show by microarray analysis across rice diversity that the preformed defence phenomenon impacts on a large number of defence-related genes without apparently affecting other biological processes. Using a guilt-by-association strategy, we identified two positive regulators that promote constitutive expression of known defence markers and partial resistance to rice blast. The HSF23 gene encodes for a putative member of the heat shock transcription factor family, while CaMBP encodes for a putative Calmodulin-binding protein. Both HSF23 and CaMBP strongly affect preformed defence and also plant growth. Additionally, we identified the OB-fold gene as a negative regulator of blast resistance, which could be involved in RNA stabilization. The OB-fold mutants do not suffer from obvious developmental defects. Taken together, our results prove that our strategy of combining analysis of gene expression diversity with guilt-by-association is a powerful way to identify disease resistance regulators in rice.",elevated constitutive expression component defence arsenal associated quantitative resistance rice blast fungus phenomenon called preformed defence role many disease regulator inducible defence system extensively studied little attention paid far gene regulate preformed defence study show microarray analysis across rice diversity preformed defence phenomenon impact large number defencerelated gene without apparently affecting biological process using guiltbyassociation strategy identified two positive regulator promote constitutive expression known defence marker partial resistance rice blast hsf gene encodes putative member heat shock transcription factor family cambp encodes putative calmodulinbinding protein hsf cambp strongly affect preformed defence also plant growth additionally identified obfold gene negative regulator blast resistance could involved rna stabilization obfold mutant suffer obvious developmental defect taken together result prove strategy combining analysis gene expression diversity guiltbyassociation powerful way identify disease resistance regulator rice,3,"{'Disease': ['constitutive expression component defence arsenal associated quantitative resistance rice blast fungus phenomenon', 'many disease regulator inducible defence system', 'disease resistance regulator rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3

34661333,The potential of dimetindene maleate inducing resistance to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae through activating the salicylic acid signaling pathway in rice plants.,"Rice blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) is considered the most destructive rice disease all over the world. Dimetindene maleate is used in medication against allergic reactions in humans. Dimetindene maleate used to induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in order to protect rice plants from blast disease. Dimetindene maleate was not effective against fungus linear growth in vitro. In glasshouse conditions, dimetindene maleate significantly improved resistance at 25, 50, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg L<sup>-1</sup> concentrations. Leaf blast severity reached 14.18% on plants treated with the most effective concentration of 125 mg L<sup>-1</sup> compared with control plants. In field conditions during both seasons (2016 and 2017), 125 mg L<sup>-1</sup> dimetindene maleate decreased the disease severity to 1.1% and 2.7%, respectively, after 30 days of treatment. Also, grain yield was increased to 13.27 and 12.90 t ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2016 and 2017 seasons, respectively.

23242918,Expression of the chimeric receptor between the chitin elicitor receptor CEBiP and the receptor-like protein kinase Pi-d2 leads to enhanced responses to the chitin elicitor and disease resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.,"We previously reported that rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor consisting of rice chitin oligosaccharides binding protein (CEBiP) and the intracellular protein kinase region of Xa21, which confers resistance to rice bacterial blight, showed enhanced cellular responses to a chitin elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose and increased resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we investigated whether CEBiP fused with another type of receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) also functions as a chimeric receptor. Fusion proteins CRPis consist of CEBiP and the intracellular protein kinase region of a true resistance gene Pi-d2. Transgenic rice expressing a CRPi showed enhanced cellular responses specifically to N-acetylchitoheptaose in cultured cells and increased levels of disease resistance against M. oryzae in plants. These responses depended on the amino acid sequences predicted to be essential for the protein kinase activity of CRPi. The structure of the transmembrane domain in CRPi affected the protein accumulation, cellular responses, and disease resistance in transgenic rice. These results suggest that the chimeric receptor consisting of CEBiP and Pi-d2 functions as a receptor for chitin oligosaccharides and CEBiP-based chimeric receptors fused with other RLKs may also act as functional receptors.",previously reported rice plant expressing chimeric receptor consisting rice chitin oligosaccharide binding protein cebip intracellular protein kinase region xa confers resistance rice bacterial blight showed enhanced cellular response chitin elicitor nacetylchitoheptaose increased resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae investigated whether cebip fused another type receptorlike protein kinase rlk also function chimeric receptor fusion protein crpis consist cebip intracellular protein kinase region true resistance gene pid transgenic rice expressing crpi showed enhanced cellular response specifically nacetylchitoheptaose cultured cell increased level disease resistance oryzae plant response depended amino acid sequence predicted essential protein kinase activity crpi structure transmembrane domain crpi affected protein accumulation cellular response disease resistance transgenic rice result suggest chimeric receptor consisting cebip pid function receptor chitin oligosaccharide cebipbased chimeric receptor fused rlks may also act functional receptor,4,"{'Disease': ['resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'specifically nacetylchitoheptaose cultured cell increased level disease resistance oryzae plant response', 'essential protein kinase activity crpi structure transmembrane domain crpi affected protein accumulation cellular response disease resistance transgenic rice result'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
23990109,Cells in cells: morphogenetic and metabolic strategies conditioning rice infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a global food security threat due to its destruction of cultivated rice. Of the world's rice harvest, 10-30 % is lost each year to this pathogen, and changing climates are likely to favor its spread into new areas. Insights into how the fungus might be contained could come from the wealth of molecular and cellular studies that have been undertaken in order to shed light on the biological underpinnings of blast disease, aspects of which we review herein. Infection begins when a three-celled spore lands on the surface of a leaf, germinates, and develops the specialized infection structure called the appressorium. The mature appressorium develops a high internal turgor that acts on a thin penetration peg, forcing it through the rice cuticle and into the underlying epidermal cells. Primary then invasive hyphae (IH) elaborate from the peg and grow asymptomatically from one living rice cell to another for the first few days of infection before host cells begin to die and characteristic necrotic lesions form on the surface of the leaf, from which spores are produced to continue the life cycle. To gain new insights into the biology of rice blast disease, we argue that, conceptually, the infection process can be viewed as two discrete phases occurring in markedly different environments and requiring distinct biochemical pathways and morphogenetic regulation: outside the host cell, where the appressorium develops in a nutrient-free environment, and inside the host cell, where filamentous growth occurs in a glucose-rich, nitrogen-poor environment, at least from the perspective of the fungus. Here, we review the physiological and metabolic changes that occur in M. oryzae as it transitions from the surface to the interior of the host, thus enabling us to draw lessons about the strategies that allow M. oryzae cells to thrive in rice cells.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae global food security threat due destruction cultivated rice world rice harvest lost year pathogen changing climate likely favor spread new area insight fungus might contained could come wealth molecular cellular study undertaken order shed light biological underpinnings blast disease aspect review herein infection begin threecelled spore land surface leaf germinates develops specialized infection structure called appressorium mature appressorium develops high internal turgor act thin penetration peg forcing rice cuticle underlying epidermal cell primary invasive hypha ih elaborate peg grow asymptomatically one living rice cell another first day infection host cell begin die characteristic necrotic lesion form surface leaf spore produced continue life cycle gain new insight biology rice blast disease argue conceptually infection process viewed two discrete phase occurring markedly different environment requiring distinct biochemical pathway morphogenetic regulation outside host cell appressorium develops nutrientfree environment inside host cell filamentous growth occurs glucoserich nitrogenpoor environment least perspective fungus review physiological metabolic change occur oryzae transition surface interior host thus enabling u draw lesson strategy allow oryzae cell thrive rice cell,2,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae global food security threat', 'new area insight fungus', 'light biological underpinnings blast disease aspect review herein infection', 'new insight biology rice blast disease', 'fungus review physiological metabolic change'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['asymptomatically one living rice cell']}",0

The RILs were challenged with 17 blast isolates collected from Thailand and Laos PDR. Quantitative trait locus analysis identified genomic regions associated with broad-spectrum quantitative resistance (qBSRLs) and racespecific quantitative resistance (qRSRLs). Two qBSRLs were detected on chromosomes 1 and 11, and two qRSRLs were detected on chromosomes 8 and 12. The two qBSRLs were introgressed into two new genetic backgrounds through marker-assisted selection (MAS). Twelve breeding lines were tested for their spectra of resistance against 35 blast isolates.

21412363,Modulating rice stress tolerance by transcription factors.,"Plants are non-mobile organisms and have to adapt to environmental stresses mostly by modulating their growth and development in addition to physiological and biochemical changes. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate genome expression in response to environmental and physiological signals, and some of them switch on plant adaptive developmental and physiological pathways. One TF is encoded by a single gene but regulates the expression of several other genes leading to the activation of complex adaptive mechanisms and hence represents major molecular targets to genetically improve the tolerance of crop plants against different stresses. In this review an updated account of the discovery of TFs involved in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in the model monocotyledonous plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is presented. We illustrate how the elucidation of the function of these TFs can be used to set up genetic engineering strategies and to rationalize molecular breeding using molecular assisted selection towards enhancement of rice tolerance to various stresses. Attempts have also been made to provide information on the molecular mechanisms involved in stress resistance or tolerance processes. We discuss how the comparison of the action of TFs isolated from the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in rice and vice versa can contribute to determine whether common or divergent mechanisms underlie stress tolerance in the two plant species. Lastly, we discuss the necessity to discover TFs controlling specifically the root adaptive development which constitutes a major way for the plant to escape to several stresses such as water deficit or mineral nutrient deficiency.",plant nonmobile organism adapt environmental stress mostly modulating growth development addition physiological biochemical change transcription factor tfs regulate genome expression response environmental physiological signal switch plant adaptive developmental physiological pathway one tf encoded single gene regulates expression several gene leading activation complex adaptive mechanism hence represents major molecular target genetically improve tolerance crop plant different stress review updated account discovery tfs involved biotic abiotic stress tolerance model monocotyledonous plant rice oryza sativa l presented illustrate elucidation function tfs used set genetic engineering strategy rationalize molecular breeding using molecular assisted selection towards enhancement rice tolerance various stress attempt also made provide information molecular mechanism involved stress resistance tolerance process discus comparison action tfs isolated dicotyledonous model plant arabidopsis thaliana rice vice versa contribute determine whether common divergent mechanism underlie stress tolerance two plant specie lastly discus necessity discover tfs controlling specifically root adaptive development constitutes major way plant escape several stress water deficit mineral nutrient deficiency,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
36878090,Metabarcoding reveals response of rice rhizosphere bacterial community to rice bacterial leaf blight.,"Rice bacterial leaf blight (BLB) is a major disease affecting cultivated rice and caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). It is well established that rhizosphere microorganisms could help improve the adaptability of plants to biotic stresses. However, it is still unclear about the response mechanism of rice rhizosphere microbial community to BLB infection. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to explore the effect of BLB on the rice rhizosphere microbial community. The results show that the alpha diversity index of the rice rhizosphere microbial community decreased significantly at the onset of BLB and then gradually recovered to normal levels. Beta diversity analysis indicated that BLB significantly affected community composition. In addition, there were significant differences in the taxonomic composition between healthy and diseased groups. For example, ceretain genera were more abundant in diseased rhizospheres, namely Streptomyces, Sphingomonas, and Flavobacterium, among others. In addition, the size and complexity of the rhizosphere co-occurrence network increased after disease onset compared to healthy groups. Also, hub microbe Rhizobiaceae and Gemmatimonadaceae were identified in the diseased rhizosphere co-occurrence network, and these hub microbes played an important role in maintaining network stability.

34728643,Accumulating candidate genes for broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast in a drought-tolerant rice cultivar.,"Biotic stresses, including diseases, severely affect rice production, compromising producers' ability to meet increasing global consumption. Understanding quantitative responses for resistance to diverse pathogens can guide development of reliable molecular markers, which, combined with advanced backcross populations, can accelerate the production of more resistant varieties. A candidate gene (CG) approach was used to accumulate different disease QTL from Moroberekan, a blast-resistant rice variety, into Vandana, a drought-tolerant variety. The advanced backcross progeny were evaluated for resistance to blast and tolerance to drought at five sites in India and the Philippines. Gene-based markers were designed to determine introgression of Moroberekan alleles for 11 CGs into the progeny. Six CGs, coding for chitinase, HSP90, oxalate oxidase, germin-like proteins, peroxidase and thaumatin-like protein, and 21 SSR markers were significantly associated with resistance to blast across screening sites. Multiple lines with different combinations, classes and numbers of CGs were associated with significant levels of race non-specific resistance to rice blast and sheath blight.

23183123,Response of rice genotype to straighthead disease as influenced by arsenic level and water management practices in soil.,"Arsenic (As) uptake by rice plants and the straighthead disease induced by As-based herbicide are of environmental concerns. Bioavailability or mobility of inorganic As in soil has been reported to be significantly influenced by soil minerals such as iron (hydr) oxide; however, the interactions of organic As such as monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA) with soil minerals are little studied, thus largely unknown. In an effort to minimize the As uptake by rice and determine rice cultivar response to soil MSMA level, a field experiment was conducted on three rice cultivars grown in both MSMA-treated and -untreated soils under continuous or intermittent flood water management practices. Results indicated that the grain yield and the occurrence of straighthead disease were cultivar-dependent and influenced by soil As level and water management practices. Straighthead-resistant cultivars yielded more and had lower grain As than the susceptible ones. Elevated soil As with continuous flood management significantly reduced the grain yield of susceptible cultivars by >89% due to substantially increased straighthead, which were induced by increased As content in grains. Yield reduction by MSMA treatment could be partially mitigated with intermittent flood water practice. The As accumulation was found to be associated with soil iron redox transformation influenced by the water management. This study demonstrates that the selection of less As-susceptible cultivars and intermittent flood water practice could be effective means to lower the As accumulation in grains and minimize the occurrence of the As-induced straighthead symptom and yield reduction.",arsenic uptake rice plant straighthead disease induced asbased herbicide environmental concern bioavailability mobility inorganic soil reported significantly influenced soil mineral iron hydr oxide however interaction organic monosodium methanearsonate msma soil mineral little studied thus largely unknown effort minimize uptake rice determine rice cultivar response soil msma level field experiment conducted three rice cultivar grown msmatreated untreated soil continuous intermittent flood water management practice result indicated grain yield occurrence straighthead disease cultivardependent influenced soil level water management practice straightheadresistant cultivar yielded lower grain susceptible one elevated soil continuous flood management significantly reduced grain yield susceptible cultivar due substantially increased straighthead induced increased content grain yield reduction msma treatment could partially mitigated intermittent flood water practice accumulation found associated soil iron redox transformation influenced water management study demonstrates selection less assusceptible cultivar intermittent flood water practice could effective mean lower accumulation grain minimize occurrence asinduced straighthead symptom yield reduction,2,"{'Disease': ['arsenic uptake rice plant straighthead disease', 'grain yield occurrence straighthead disease cultivardependent influenced soil level water management practice'], 'Treatment': ['grain yield occurrence straighthead disease cultivardependent influenced soil level water management practice', 'lower grain susceptible one elevated soil continuous flood management', 'due substantially increased straighthead induced increased content grain yield reduction msma treatment'], 'Symptom': ['straighthead symptom yield reduction']}",1

TFIIAgamma is a general eukaryotic transcription factor with no previously known role in disease resistance. xa5 is unusual in that it is recessive and does not conform to one of the typical resistance gene structural classes. Sequencing of TFIIAgamma in resistant and susceptible isolines revealed two nucleotide substitutions resulting in an amino acid change between resistant and susceptible cultivars.

Osa-miR1873 is a rice-specific miRNA targeting LOC_Os05g01790. Here, we show that Osa-miR1873 fine-tunes rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae and yield traits via LOC_Os05g01790. Osa-miR1873 was significantly upregulated in a susceptible accession but downregulated in a resistance accession at 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) of M. oryzae. Overexpressing Osa-miR1873 enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae and compromised induction of defense responses. In contrast, blocking Osa-miR1873 through target mimicry compromised susceptibility to M. oryzae and enhanced induction of defense responses. Altered expression of Osa-miR1873 also resulted in some defects in yield traits, including grain numbers and seed setting rate. Moreover, overexpression of the target gene LOC_Os05g01790 increased rice blast disease resistance but severely penalized growth and yield. Taken together, we demonstrate that Osa-miR1873 fine-tunes the rice immunity-growth trade-off via LOC_Os05g01790, and blocking Osa-miR1873 could improve blast disease resistance without significant yield penalty.

However, the farmers and planting experts have been facing many persistent agricultural challenges for centuries, such as different diseases of rice. The severe rice diseases may lead to no harvest of grains; therefore, a fast, automatic, less expensive and accurate method to detect rice diseases is highly desired in the field of agricultural information. In this article, we study the deep learning approach for solving the task since it has shown outstanding performance in image processing and classification problem. Combining the advantages of both, the DenseNet pre-trained on ImageNet and Inception module were selected to be used in the network, and this approach presents a superior performance with respect to other state-of-the-art methods. It achieves an average predicting accuracy of no less than 94.07% in the public dataset. Even when multiple diseases were considered, the average accuracy reaches 98.63% for the class prediction of rice disease images.

23054004,Cloning and characterization of two rice long-chain base kinase genes and their function in disease resistance and cell death.,"Sphingolipid metabolites such as long-chain base 1-phosphates (LCBPs) have been shown to play an important role in plants; however, little is known about their function in plant disease resistance and programmed cell death (PCD). In the present study, we cloned and identified two rice long-chain base kinase (LCBK) genes (OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2), which are involved in biosynthesis of LCBPs, and performed functional analysis in transgenic tobacco. Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsLCBK1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv. tabacci, the causal agent of wildfire disease, and tobacco mosaic virus. Expression levels of some defense-related genes were constitutively up-regulated and further induced after pathogen infection in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants. Treatment with fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an effective inducer of PCD in plants, resulted in reduced level of cell death in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants, as indicated by cell death staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes. These data suggest that rice LCBKs, probably through regulation of endogenous LCBP level, play important roles in disease resistance response and PCD in plants.",sphingolipid metabolite longchain base phosphate lcbps shown play important role plant however little known function plant disease resistance programmed cell death pcd present study cloned identified two rice longchain base kinase lcbk gene oslcbk oslcbk involved biosynthesis lcbps performed functional analysis transgenic tobacco expression oslcbk oslcbk induced rice seedling treatment defense signaling molecule infection magnaporthe grisea causal agent blast disease transgenic tobacco plant overexpressing oslcbk generated disease resistance assay indicate oslcbkoverexpressing plant showed enhanced disease resistance pseudmonas syringae pv tabacci causal agent wildfire disease tobacco mosaic virus expression level defenserelated gene constitutively upregulated induced pathogen infection oslcbkoverexpressing plant treatment fungal toxin fumonisin b effective inducer pcd plant resulted reduced level cell death oslcbkoverexpressing plant indicated cell death staining leakage electrolyte expression hypersensitive response indicator gene data suggest rice lcbks probably regulation endogenous lcbp level play important role disease resistance response pcd plant,2,"{'Disease': ['little known function plant disease resistance', 'oslcbk generated disease resistance', 'enhanced disease resistance pseudmonas syringae pv tabacci causal agent wildfire disease tobacco mosaic virus expression level defenserelated gene', 'important role disease resistance response pcd plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
24884531,Natural rice rhizospheric microbes suppress rice blast infections.,"The natural interactions between plant roots and their rhizospheric microbiome are vital to plant fitness, modulating both growth promotion and disease suppression. In rice (Oryza sativa), a globally important food crop, as much as 30% of yields are lost due to blast disease caused by fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Capitalizing on the abilities of naturally occurring rice soil bacteria to reduce M. oryzae infections could provide a sustainable solution to reduce the amount of crops lost to blast disease. Naturally occurring root-associated rhizospheric bacteria were isolated from California field grown rice plants (M-104), eleven of which were taxonomically identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Bacterial isolates were tested for biocontrol activity against the devastating foliar rice fungal pathogen, M. oryzae pathovar 70-15. In vitro, a Pseudomonas isolate, EA105, displayed antibiosis through reducing appressoria formation by nearly 90% as well as directly inhibiting fungal growth by 76%. Although hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a volatile commonly produced by biocontrol pseudomonads, the activity of EA105 seems to be independent of its HCN production. During in planta experiments, EA105 reduced the number of blast lesions formed by 33% and Pantoea agglomerans isolate, EA106 by 46%. Our data also show both EA105 and EA106 trigger jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) response in rice. Out of 11 bacteria isolated from rice soil, pseudomonad EA105 most effectively inhibited the growth and appressoria formation of M. oryzae through a mechanism that is independent of cyanide production. In addition to direct antagonism, EA105 also appears to trigger ISR in rice plants through a mechanism that is dependent on JA and ET signaling, ultimately resulting in fewer blast lesions. The application of native bacteria as biocontrol agents in combination with current disease protection strategies could aid in global food security.",natural interaction plant root rhizospheric microbiome vital plant fitness modulating growth promotion disease suppression rice oryza sativa globally important food crop much yield lost due blast disease caused fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae capitalizing ability naturally occurring rice soil bacteria reduce oryzae infection could provide sustainable solution reduce amount crop lost blast disease naturally occurring rootassociated rhizospheric bacteria isolated california field grown rice plant eleven taxonomically identified rrna gene sequencing fatty acid methyl ester fame analysis bacterial isolates tested biocontrol activity devastating foliar rice fungal pathogen oryzae pathovar vitro pseudomonas isolate ea displayed antibiosis reducing appressoria formation nearly well directly inhibiting fungal growth although hydrogen cyanide hcn volatile commonly produced biocontrol pseudomonad activity ea seems independent hcn production planta experiment ea reduced number blast lesion formed pantoea agglomerans isolate ea data also show ea ea trigger jasmonic acid ja ethylene et dependent induced systemic resistance isr response rice bacteria isolated rice soil pseudomonad ea effectively inhibited growth appressoria formation oryzae mechanism independent cyanide production addition direct antagonism ea also appears trigger isr rice plant mechanism dependent ja et signaling ultimately resulting fewer blast lesion application native bacteria biocontrol agent combination current disease protection strategy could aid global food security,2,"{'Disease': ['natural interaction plant root rhizospheric microbiome vital plant fitness modulating growth promotion disease suppression rice oryza sativa', 'due blast disease', 'amount crop lost blast disease', 'fewer blast lesion application native bacteria biocontrol agent combination current disease protection strategy'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['ea effectively inhibited growth appressoria formation oryzae mechanism independent cyanide production addition']}",1
31137840,Rice Genome Resequencing Reveals a Major Quantitative Trait Locus for Resistance to Bakanae Disease Caused by <i>Fusarium fujikuroi</i>.,"Bakanae disease (BD), caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium fujikuroi</i>, has become a serious threat in rice-cultivating regions worldwide. In the present study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed using F2 and F3 plants derived after crossing a BD-resistant and a BD-susceptible Korean japonica rice variety, 'Samgwang' and 'Junam', respectively. Resequencing of 'Junam' and 'Samgwang' genomes revealed 151,916 DNA polymorphisms between the two varieties. After genotyping 188 F2 plants, we constructed a genetic map comprising 184 markers, including 175 kompetitive allele-specific PCR markers, eight cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers, and a derived CAPS (dCAPS) marker. The degree of BD susceptibility of each F2 plant was evaluated on the basis of the mortality rate measured with corresponding F3 progeny seedlings by in vitro screening. Consequently, <i>qFfR9</i>, a major QTL, was discovered at 30.1 centimorgan (cM) on chromosome 9 with a logarithm of the odds score of 60.3. For the QTL interval, 95% probability lay within a 7.24-7.56 Mbp interval. In this interval, we found that eight genes exhibited non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by comparing the 'Junam' and 'Samgwang' genome sequence data, and are possibly candidate genes for <i>qFfR9</i>; therefore, <i>qFfR9</i> could be utilized as a valuable resource for breeding BD-resistant rice varieties.",bakanae disease bd caused fungal pathogen ifusarium fujikuroii become serious threat ricecultivating region worldwide present study quantitative trait locus qtl mapping performed using f f plant derived crossing bdresistant bdsusceptible korean japonica rice variety samgwang junam respectively resequencing junam samgwang genome revealed dna polymorphism two variety genotyping f plant constructed genetic map comprising marker including kompetitive allelespecific pcr marker eight cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence cap marker derived cap dcaps marker degree bd susceptibility f plant evaluated basis mortality rate measured corresponding f progeny seedling vitro screening consequently iqffri major qtl discovered centimorgan cm chromosome logarithm odds score qtl interval probability lay within mbp interval interval found eight gene exhibited nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism snp comparing junam samgwang genome sequence data possibly candidate gene iqffri therefore iqffri could utilized valuable resource breeding bdresistant rice variety,0,"{'Disease': ['bakanae disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2

This study used hydroponic assays to explore how ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) affect rice after inoculation with Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). The results showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, compared to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, significantly reduced disease severity, fungal growth, fungal hyphae number, the expansion capacity of infectious hyphae, and disease-related loss of photosynthesis. Additionally, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> enhanced the expression of defense-related genes, including OsPBZ1, OsCHT1, OsPR1a, and OsPR10. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-treated rice also exhibited higher hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulation and increased antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover, susceptibility to rice blast disease increased when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was scavenged, while a reduction in susceptibility was observed with the application of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

25403621,Genome-wide association study of blast resistance in indica rice.,"Rice blast disease is one of the most serious and recurrent problems in rice-growing regions worldwide. Most resistance genes were identified by linkage mapping using genetic populations. We extensively examined 16 rice blast strains and a further genome-wide association study based on genotyping 0.8 million single nucleotide polymorphism variants across 366 diverse indica accessions. Totally, thirty associated loci were identified. The strongest signal (Chr11_6526998, P =1.17 × 10-17) was located within the gene Os11g0225100, one of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene. Another association signal (Chr11_30606558) was detected around the QTL Pif. Our study identified the gene Os11g0704100, a disease resistance protein containing nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat domain, as the main candidate gene of Pif. In order to explore the potential mechanism underlying the blast resistance, we further examined a locus in chromosome 12, which was associated with CH149 (P =7.53 × 10-15). The genes, Os12g0424700 and Os12g0427000, both described as kinase-like domain containing protein, were presumed to be required for the full function of this locus. Furthermore, we found some association on chromosome 3, in which it has not been reported any loci associated with rice blast resistance. In addition, we identified novel functional candidate genes, which might participate in the resistance regulation. This work provides the basis of further study of the potential function of these candidate genes. A subset of true associations would be weakly associated with outcome in any given GWAS; therefore, large-scale replication is necessary to confirm our results.

35576156,The bacterial effector AvrRxo1 inhibits vitamin B6 biosynthesis to promote infection in rice.,"Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes rice bacterial leaf streak, invades leaves mainly through stomata, which are often closed as a plant immune response against pathogen invasion. How Xoc overcomes stomatal immunity is unclear. Here, we show that the effector protein AvrRxo1, an ATP-dependent protease, enhances Xoc virulence and inhibits stomatal immunity by targeting and degrading rice OsPDX1 (pyridoxal phosphate synthase), thereby reducing vitamin B6 (VB6) levels in rice. VB6 is required for the activity of aldehyde oxidase, which catalyzes the last step of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, and ABA positively regulates rice stomatal immunity against Xoc. Thus, we provide evidence supporting a model in which a major bacterial pathogen inhibits plant stomatal immunity by directly targeting VB6 biosynthesis and consequently inhibiting the biosynthesis of ABA in guard cells to open stomata. Moreover, AvrRxo1-mediated VB6 targeting also explains the poor nutritional quality, including low VB6 levels, of Xoc-infected rice grains.",xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola xoc cause rice bacterial leaf streak invades leaf mainly stoma often closed plant immune response pathogen invasion xoc overcomes stomatal immunity unclear show effector protein avrrxo atpdependent protease enhances xoc virulence inhibits stomatal immunity targeting degrading rice ospdx pyridoxal phosphate synthase thereby reducing vitamin b vb level rice vb required activity aldehyde oxidase catalyzes last step abscisic acid aba biosynthesis aba positively regulates rice stomatal immunity xoc thus provide evidence supporting model major bacterial pathogen inhibits plant stomatal immunity directly targeting vb biosynthesis consequently inhibiting biosynthesis aba guard cell open stoma moreover avrrxomediated vb targeting also explains poor nutritional quality including low vb level xocinfected rice grain,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['unclear show effector protein avrrxo atpdependent protease']}",4
21046317,Identification of genes contributing to quantitative disease resistance in rice.,"Despite the importance of quantitative disease resistance during a plant's life, little is known about the molecular basis of this type of host-pathogen interaction, because most of the genes underlying resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are unknown.

We also examined the expression patterns of these genes in response to pathogen infection in the parents of the mapping populations, based on the strategy of validation and functional analysis of the QTLs. The results suggest that defense-responsive genes are important resources of resistance QTLs in rice. OsWRKY45-1 is the gene contributing to a major resistance QTL.

Strengthening of the cell wall by Xa4 enhances resistance to bacterial infection, and also increases mechanical strength of the culm with slightly reduced plant height, which may improve lodging resistance of the rice plant. The simultaneous improvement of multiple agronomic traits conferred by Xa4 may account for its widespread and lasting utilization in rice breeding programmes globally.",major disease resistance gene xa confers racespecific durable resistance xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae cause damaging bacterial disease rice worldwide although xa one widely exploited resistance gene rice production worldwide molecular nature remains unknown show xa encoding cell wallassociated kinase improves multiple trait agronomic importance without compromising grain yield strengthening cell wall via promoting cellulose synthesis suppressing cell wall loosening strengthening cell wall xa enhances resistance bacterial infection also increase mechanical strength culm slightly reduced plant height may improve lodging resistance rice plant simultaneous improvement multiple agronomic trait conferred xa may account widespread lasting utilization rice breeding programme globally,4,"{'Disease': ['major disease resistance gene', 'bacterial disease rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
38834685,The unconventional resistance protein PTR recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pita in an allele-specific manner.,"Blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating rice diseases. Disease resistance genes such as Pi-ta or Pi-ta2 are critical in protecting rice production from blast. Published work reports that Pi-ta codes for a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain protein (NLR) that recognizes the fungal protease-like effector AVR-Pita by direct binding. However, this model was challenged by the recent discovery that Pi-ta2 resistance, which also relies on AVR-Pita detection, is conferred by the unconventional resistance gene Ptr, which codes for a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic armadillo repeat domain. Here, using NLR Pi-ta and Ptr RNAi knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutant rice lines, we found that AVR-Pita recognition relies solely on Ptr and that the NLR Pi-ta has no role in it, indicating that it is not the Pi-ta resistance gene. Different alleles of Ptr confer different recognition specificities. The A allele of Ptr (PtrA) detects all natural sequence variants of the effector and confers Pi-ta2 resistance, while the B allele of Ptr (PtrB) recognizes a restricted set of AVR-Pita alleles and, thereby, confers Pi-ta resistance. Analysis of the natural diversity in AVR-Pita and of mutant and transgenic strains identified one specific polymorphism in the effector sequence that controls escape from PtrB-mediated resistance. Taken together, our work establishes that the M. oryzae effector AVR-Pita is detected in an allele-specific manner by the unconventional rice resistance protein Ptr and that the NLR Pi-ta has no function in Pi-ta resistance and the recognition of AVR-Pita.",blast disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating rice disease disease resistance gene pita pita critical protecting rice production blast published work report pita code nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat domain protein nlr recognizes fungal proteaselike effector avrpita direct binding however model challenged recent discovery pita resistance also relies avrpita detection conferred unconventional resistance gene ptr code membrane protein cytoplasmic armadillo repeat domain using nlr pita ptr rnai knockdown crisprcas knockout mutant rice line found avrpita recognition relies solely ptr nlr pita role indicating pita resistance gene different allele ptr confer different recognition specificity allele ptr ptra detects natural sequence variant effector confers pita resistance b allele ptr ptrb recognizes restricted set avrpita allele thereby confers pita resistance analysis natural diversity avrpita mutant transgenic strain identified one specific polymorphism effector sequence control escape ptrbmediated resistance taken together work establishes oryzae effector avrpita detected allelespecific manner unconventional rice resistance protein ptr nlr pita function pita resistance recognition avrpita,4,"{'Disease': ['blast disease', 'fungus magnaporthe'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['fungal proteaselike effector avrpita direct binding however model', 'one specific polymorphism effector sequence control', 'oryzae effector avrpita']}",1

Pre- and postinoculation treatments of this herbicide reduced disease development. Glufosinate ammonium specifically impeded appressorium formation of the pathogens Magnaporthe grisea and Cochliobolus miyabeanus on hydrophobic surface and on transgenic rice. In contrast, conidial germination remained unaffected. Glufosinate ammonium diminished mycelial growth of two pathogens; however, this inhibitory effect was attenuated in malnutrition conditions. Glufosinate ammonium caused slight chlorosis and diminished chlorophyll content; however, these alterations were almost completely restored in transgenic rice within 7 d.

Here, we describe a newly established post-inoculation treatment assay that facilitates investigations into the effect of the sulfated RaxX peptide in planta. In this assay, rice plants were inoculated with a virulent strain of Xoo and then treated with the RaxX peptide 2 days after inoculation. We found that post-inoculation treatment of XA21 plants with the sulfated RaxX peptide suppresses the development of Xoo infection in XA21 rice plants. The treated plants display restricted lesion development and reduced bacterial growth. Our findings demonstrate that exogenous application of sulfated RaxX activates XA21-mediated immunity in planta, and provides a potential strategy for the control of bacterial disease in the field.",rice xa receptor kinase confers robust resistance bacterial blight disease caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo tyrosinesulfated peptide xoo called raxx trigger xamediated immune response including production ethylene reactive oxygen specie induction defence gene expression tested previously whether response confer effective resistance xoo describe newly established postinoculation treatment assay facilitates investigation effect sulfated raxx peptide planta assay rice plant inoculated virulent strain xoo treated raxx peptide day inoculation found postinoculation treatment xa plant sulfated raxx peptide suppresses development xoo infection xa rice plant treated plant display restricted lesion development reduced bacterial growth finding demonstrate exogenous application sulfated raxx activates xamediated immunity planta provides potential strategy control bacterial disease field,3,"{'Disease': ['robust resistance bacterial blight disease', 'potential strategy control bacterial disease field'], 'Treatment': ['newly established postinoculation treatment assay facilitates investigation effect', 'postinoculation treatment xa plant'], 'Symptom': ['effective resistance', 'newly established postinoculation treatment assay facilitates investigation effect']}",2
18257679,OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance.,"The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses. Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast. They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants. Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1. OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races. Overexpression of the OsSGT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion most likely caused a dominant negative phenotype which led to race-specific-like basal resistance. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1-GFP show enhanced resistance to DY89031 but decreased resistance to PXO99, implying that OsSGT1 might be the target of a component required for DY89031 virulence or OsSGT1-GFP might stabilize weak resistance proteins against DY89031. Consistent with the hypothesis of the dominant negative regulation, we observed the reduced sensitivity to auxin of OsSGT1-GFP plants compared with the wild-type ones, and the curling-root phenotype in OsSGT1-OE plants. These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance. Our current study also provides new insight into the roles of OsSGT1 in basal disease resistance.",rar sgt protein function synergistically antagonistically plant innate immune response show rice orthologs osrar ossgt physically interact vivo yeast displayed conserved role arabidopsis disease resistance ectopic expression arabidopsis rar sgt mutant overexpression osrar ossgt rice significantly increased basal resistance virulent bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae pxo another virulent strain dy suggesting racespecificlike basal resistance conferred osrar ossgt osraroe ossgtoe plant also enhanced resistance four virulent blast fungal magnaporthe oryzae race overexpression ossgtgreen fluorescent protein gfp fusion likely caused dominant negative phenotype led racespecificlike basal resistance transgenic plant overexpressing ossgtgfp show enhanced resistance dy decreased resistance pxo implying ossgt might target component required dy virulence ossgtgfp might stabilize weak resistance protein dy consistent hypothesis dominant negative regulation observed reduced sensitivity auxin ossgtgfp plant compared wildtype one curlingroot phenotype ossgtoe plant result collectively suggest osrar ossgt might differentially required rice basal disease resistance current study also provides new insight role ossgt basal disease resistance,2,"{'Disease': ['conserved role arabidopsis disease resistance ectopic expression arabidopsis rar sgt mutant overexpression', 'rice basal disease resistance current study', 'new insight role ossgt basal disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
33602120,Genome-wide association of rice response to blast fungus identifies loci for robust resistance under high nitrogen.,"Nitrogen fertilization is known to increase disease susceptibility, a phenomenon called Nitrogen-Induced Susceptibility (NIS). In rice, this phenomenon has been observed in infections with the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. A previous classical genetic study revealed a locus (NIS1) that enhances susceptibility to rice blast under high nitrogen fertilization. In order to further address the underlying genetics of plasticity in susceptibility to rice blast after fertilization, we analyzed NIS under greenhouse-controlled conditions in a panel of 139 temperate japonica rice strains. A genome-wide association analysis was conducted to identify loci potentially involved in NIS by comparing susceptibility loci identified under high and low nitrogen conditions, an approach allowing for the identification of loci validated across different nitrogen environments. We also used a novel NIS Index to identify loci potentially contributing to plasticity in susceptibility under different nitrogen fertilization regimes. A global NIS effect was observed in the population, with the density of lesions increasing by 8%, on average, under high nitrogen fertilization. Three new QTL, other than NIS1, were identified. A rare allele of the RRobN1 locus on chromosome 6 provides robust resistance in high and low nitrogen environments. A frequent allele of the NIS2 locus, on chromosome 5, exacerbates blast susceptibility under the high nitrogen condition. Finally, an allele of NIS3, on chromosome 10, buffers the increase of susceptibility arising from nitrogen fertilization but increases global levels of susceptibility. This allele is almost fixed in temperate japonicas, as a probable consequence of genetic hitchhiking with a locus involved in cold stress adaptation. Our results extend to an entire rice subspecies the initial finding that nitrogen increases rice blast susceptibility. We demonstrate the usefulness of estimating plasticity for the identification of novel loci involved in the response of rice to the blast fungus under different nitrogen regimes.",nitrogen fertilization known increase disease susceptibility phenomenon called nitrogeninduced susceptibility ni rice phenomenon observed infection blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae previous classical genetic study revealed locus ni enhances susceptibility rice blast high nitrogen fertilization order address underlying genetics plasticity susceptibility rice blast fertilization analyzed ni greenhousecontrolled condition panel temperate japonica rice strain genomewide association analysis conducted identify locus potentially involved ni comparing susceptibility locus identified high low nitrogen condition approach allowing identification locus validated across different nitrogen environment also used novel ni index identify locus potentially contributing plasticity susceptibility different nitrogen fertilization regime global ni effect observed population density lesion increasing average high nitrogen fertilization three new qtl ni identified rare allele rrobn locus chromosome provides robust resistance high low nitrogen environment frequent allele ni locus chromosome exacerbates blast susceptibility high nitrogen condition finally allele ni chromosome buffer increase susceptibility arising nitrogen fertilization increase global level susceptibility allele almost fixed temperate japonica probable consequence genetic hitchhiking locus involved cold stress adaptation result extend entire rice subspecies initial finding nitrogen increase rice blast susceptibility demonstrate usefulness estimating plasticity identification novel locus involved response rice blast fungus different nitrogen regime,0,"{'Disease': ['nitrogen fertilization known increase disease susceptibility phenomenon', 'response rice blast fungus different nitrogen regime'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['global ni effect']}",3
26940322,Exogenous proteinogenic amino acids induce systemic resistance in rice.,"Plant immune responses can be induced by endogenous and exogenous signaling molecules. Recently, amino acids and their metabolites have been reported to affect the plant immune system. However, how amino acids act in plant defense responses has yet to be clarified. Here, we report that treatment of rice roots with amino acids such as glutamate (Glu) induced systemic disease resistance against rice blast in leaves. Treatment of roots with Glu activated the transcription of a large variety of defense-related genes both in roots and leaves. In leaves, salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes, rather than jasmonic acid (JA) or ethylene (ET)-responsive genes, were induced by this treatment. The Glu-induced blast resistance was partially impaired in rice plants deficient in SA signaling such as NahG plants expressing an SA hydroxylase, WRKY45-knockdown, and OsNPR1-knockdown plants. The JA-deficient mutant cpm2 exhibited full Glu-induced blast resistance. Our results indicate that the amino acid-induced blast resistance partly depends on the SA pathway but an unknown SA-independent signaling pathway is also involved.",plant immune response induced endogenous exogenous signaling molecule recently amino acid metabolite reported affect plant immune system however amino acid act plant defense response yet clarified report treatment rice root amino acid glutamate glu induced systemic disease resistance rice blast leaf treatment root glu activated transcription large variety defenserelated gene root leaf leaf salicylic acid saresponsive gene rather jasmonic acid ja ethylene etresponsive gene induced treatment gluinduced blast resistance partially impaired rice plant deficient sa signaling nahg plant expressing sa hydroxylase wrkyknockdown osnprknockdown plant jadeficient mutant cpm exhibited full gluinduced blast resistance result indicate amino acidinduced blast resistance partly depends sa pathway unknown saindependent signaling pathway also involved,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['treatment gluinduced blast resistance'], 'Symptom': []}",4
22705591,Thiamine primed defense provides reliable alternative to systemic fungicide carbendazim against sheath blight disease in rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"A novel pathogen defense strategy by thiamine priming was evaluated for its efficacy against sheath blight pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani AG-1A, of rice and compared with that of systemic fungicide, carbendazim (BCM). Seeds of semidwarf, high yielding, basmati rice variety Vasumati were treated with thiamine (50 mM) and BCM (4 mM). The pot cultured plants were challenge inoculated with R. solani after 40 days of sowing and effect of thiamine and BCM on rice growth and yield traits was examined. Higher hydrogen peroxide content, total phenolics accumulation, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity under thiamine treatment displayed elevated level of systemic resistance, which was further augmented under challenging pathogen infection. High transcript level of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) validated mode of thiamine primed defense. Though minimum disease severity was observed under BCM treatment, thiamine produced comparable results, with 18.12 per cent lower efficacy. Along with fortifying defense components and minor influence on photosynthetic pigments and nitrate reductase (NR) activity, thiamine treatment significantly reduced pathogen-induced loss in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, NR activity and NR transcript level. Physiological traits affected under pathogen infection were found signatory for characterizing plant's response under disease and were detectable at early stage of infection.

24240781,Major QTLs control resistance to rice hoja blanca virus and its vector Tagosodes orizicolus.,"Rice hoja blanca (white leaf) disease can cause severe yield losses in rice in the Americas. The disease is caused by the rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV), which is transmitted by the planthopper vector Tagosodes orizicolus. Because classical breeding schemes for this disease rely on expensive, time-consuming screenings, there is a need for alternatives such as marker-aided selection. The varieties Fedearroz 2000 and Fedearroz 50, which are resistant to RHBV and to the feeding damage caused by T. orizicolus, were crossed with the susceptible line WC366 to produce segregating F2:3 populations. The F3 families were scored for their resistance level to RHBV and T. orizicolus. The F2:3 lines of both crosses were genotyped using microsatellite markers. One major QTL on the short arm of chromosome 4 was identified for resistance to RHBV in the two populations. Two major QTL on chromosomes 5 and 7 were identified for resistance to T. orizicolus in the Fd2000 × WC366 and Fd50 × WC366 crosses, respectively. This comparative study using two distinct rice populations allowed for a better understanding of how the resistance to RHBV and its vector are controlled genetically.

29230584,Mapping of a major quantitative trait locus for bakanae disease resistance in rice by genome resequencing.,"Bakanae disease (BD) has emerged as a serious threat in almost all rice cultivation regions worldwide. Nampyeong is a Korean japonica rice variety known to be resistant to BD. In this study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was performed with F2 and F3 plants derived from a cross between the Nampyeong variety and a susceptible Korean japonica line, DongjinAD. First, resequencing of Nampyeong and DongjinAD was performed, which identified 171,035 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the two parental varieties. Using these SNPs, 161 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers and six derived CAPS markers were developed; then, a genetic map was constructed from the genotypes of 180 plants from the DongjinAD/Nampyeong F2 plants. The total length of the constructed genetic map was 1386 cM, with an average interval of 8.9 cM between markers. The BD mortality rates of each F3 family were measured by testing 40 F3 progenies using in vitro seedling screening method. QTL analysis based on the genetic map and mortality rate data revealed a major QTL, qFfR1, on rice chromosome 1. qFfR1 was located at 89.8 cM with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 22.7. Further, there were three markers at this point: JNS01033, JNS01037, and JNS01041. A total of 15 genes were identified with annotations related to defense against plant diseases among the 179 genes in the qFfR1 interval at 95% probability, thereby providing potential candidate genes for qFfR1. qFfR1 and its closely linked markers will be useful in breeding rice varieties resistant to BD.",bakanae disease bd emerged serious threat almost rice cultivation region worldwide nampyeong korean japonica rice variety known resistant bd study quantitative trait locus qtl mapping performed f f plant derived cross nampyeong variety susceptible korean japonica line dongjinad first resequencing nampyeong dongjinad performed identified single nucleotide polymorphism snp two parental variety using snp cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence cap marker six derived cap marker developed genetic map constructed genotype plant dongjinadnampyeong f plant total length constructed genetic map cm average interval cm marker bd mortality rate f family measured testing f progeny using vitro seedling screening method qtl analysis based genetic map mortality rate data revealed major qtl qffr rice chromosome qffr located cm logarithm odds lod score three marker point jns jns jns total gene identified annotation related defense plant disease among gene qffr interval probability thereby providing potential candidate gene qffr qffr closely linked marker useful breeding rice variety resistant bd,0,"{'Disease': ['annotation related defense plant disease'], 'Treatment': ['vitro seedling screening method'], 'Symptom': []}",2
38629772,OsATL32 ubiquitinates the reactive oxygen species-producing OsRac5-OsRbohB module to suppress rice immunity.,"Ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation is integral to plant immunity, with E3 ubiquitin ligases acting as key factors in this process. Here, we report the functions of OsATL32, a plasma membrane-localized Arabidopsis Tóxicos En Levadura (ATL)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, in rice (Oryza sativa) immunity and its associated regulatory network. We found that the expression of OsATL32 is downregulated in both compatible and incompatible interactions between rice and the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. The OsATL32 protein level declines in response to infection by a compatible M. oryzae strain or to chitin treatment. OsATL32 negatively regulates rice resistance to blast and bacterial leaf blight diseases, as well as chitin-triggered immunity. Biochemical and genetic studies revealed that OsATL32 suppresses pathogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of the ROS-producing OsRac5-OsRbohB module, which enhances rice immunity against M. oryzae. The protein phosphatase PHOSPHATASE AND TENSIN HOMOLOG enhances rice blast resistance by dephosphorylating OsATL32 and promoting its degradation, preventing its negative effect on rice immunity.

21901547,Identification of candidate genes in rice for resistance to sheath blight disease by whole genome sequencing.,"Recent advances in whole genome sequencing (WGS) have allowed identification of genes for disease susceptibility in humans. The objective of our research was to exploit whole genome sequences of 13 rice (Oryza sativa L.) inbred lines to identify non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and candidate genes for resistance to sheath blight, a disease of worldwide significance. WGS by the Illumina GA IIx platform produced an average 5× coverage with ~700 K variants detected per line when compared to the Nipponbare reference genome. Two filtering strategies were developed to identify nsSNPs between two groups of known resistant and susceptible lines. A total of 333 nsSNPs detected in the resistant lines were absent in the susceptible group. Selected variants associated with resistance were found in 11 of 12 chromosomes. More than 200 genes with selected nsSNPs were assigned to 42 categories based on gene family/gene ontology. Several candidate genes belonged to families reported in previous studies, and three new regions with novel candidates were also identified. A subset of 24 nsSNPs detected in 23 genes was selected for further study. Individual alleles of the 24 nsSNPs were evaluated by PCR whose presence or absence corresponded to known resistant or susceptible phenotypes of nine additional lines. Sanger sequencing confirmed presence of 12 selected nsSNPs in two lines.

33394228,Rapid genotyping of bacterial leaf blight resistant genes of rice using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay.,"The use of resistant (R) genes is the most effective strategy to manage bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease of rice. Several attempts were made to incorporate R genes into susceptible rice cultivars using marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). However, MABB relies exclusively on PCR for foreground selection of R genes, which requires expensive equipment for thermo-cycling and visualization of results; hence, it is limited to sophisticated research facilities. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay do not require thermo-cycling during the assay. Therefore, it will be the best alternative to PCR-based genotyping. In this study, we have developed a LAMP assay for the specific and sensitive genotyping of seven BLB resistance (R) genes viz., Xa1, Xa3, Xa4, Xa7, Xa10, Xa11, and Xa21 in rice. Gene-specific primers were designed for the LAMP assay. The LAMP assay was optimized for time, temperature, and template DNA concentration. For effective detection, incubation at 60 °C for 30 min was optimum for all seven R genes. A DNA intercalating dye ethidium bromide and a calorimetric dye hydroxynaphthol blue was used for result visualization. Further, sensitivity assay revealed that the LAMP assay could detect R genes at 100 fg of template DNA compared to 1 ng and 10 pg, respectively, in conventional PCR and q-PCR assays.

Although the virus was first detected in southern China in 2015, few studies have investigated rice symptoms and yield losses caused by RSMV infection. In this study, we observed and systematically compared symptoms of three virally infected, representative varieties of indica, hybrid and japonica rice and determined the yield parameters of the artificially inoculated plants. The three RSMV-infected cultivated rice varieties exhibited slight dwarfing, striped mosaicism, stiff, crinkled or even twisted leaves, an increased number of tillers, delayed heading, cluster-shaped shortening of panicles and mostly unfilled grains. Slight differences in symptom occurrence time were observed under different environmental conditions. For example, mosaic symptoms appeared earlier and crinkling symptoms appeared later, with both symptoms later receding in some infected plants. Yield losses due to RSMV also differed among varieties. The most serious yield reduction was experienced by indica rice (cv. Meixiangzhan), followed by hybrid indica rice (cv. Wuyou 1179) and then japonica (cv. Nipponbare).

35871691,"Identification and fine-mapping of Xo2, a novel rice bacterial leaf streak resistance gene.","A novel rice resistance gene, Xo2, influencing pathogenesis of the bacterial leaf streak disease, has been identified, and candidate genes for Xo2 in the fine mapping region have been shown to be involved in bacterial leaf streak resistance. Rice (Oryza sativa) bacterial leaf streak, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), is one of the most serious rice bacterial diseases. The deployment of host resistance genes is an effective approach for controlling this disease. The cultivar BHADOIA 303 (X455) from Bangladesh is resistant to most of Chinese Xoc races. To identify and map the resistance gene(s) involved in Xoc resistance, we examined the association between phenotypic and genotypic variations in two F<sub>2</sub> populations derived from crosses between X455/Jingang 30 and X455/Wushansimiao. The segregation ratios of the F<sub>2</sub> progeny were consistent with the action of a single dominant resistance gene, which was designated as Xo2. Based on rice SNP chip (GSR40K) assays of X455, Jingang 30, and resistant and susceptible pools thereof, we mapped Xo2 to the region from 10 Mb to 12.5 Mb on chromosome 2.

The de novo sequencing and gene annotation of X455 and Jingang 30 revealed nineteen predicted genes within the target region.

26869604,Screening Rice Cultivars for Resistance to Bacterial Leaf Blight.,"Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most serious threats to rice production. In this study, screening of rice for resistance to BLB was carried out at two different times and locations; that is, in a greenhouse during winter and in an open field during summer. The pathogenicity of Xoo race K1 was tested on 32 Korean rice cultivars. Inoculation was conducted at the maximum tillering stage, and the lesion length was measured after 14 days of inoculation. Five cultivars, Hanareum, Namcheon, Samgdeok, Samgang, and Yangjo, were found to be resistant in both the greenhouse and open-field screenings. Expression of the plant defense-related genes JAmyb, OsNPR1, OsPR1a, OsWRKY45, and OsPR10b was observed in resistant and susceptible cultivars by qRT-PCR. Among the five genes tested, only OsPR10b showed coherent expression with the phenotypes. Screening of resistance to Xoo in rice was more accurate when conducted in open fields in the summer cultivation period than in greenhouses in winter. The expression of plant defenserelated genes after bacterial inoculation could give another perspective in elucidating defense mechanisms by using both resistant and susceptible individuals.",bacterial leaf blight blb caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo one serious threat rice production study screening rice resistance blb carried two different time location greenhouse winter open field summer pathogenicity xoo race k tested korean rice cultivar inoculation conducted maximum tillering stage lesion length measured day inoculation five cultivar hanareum namcheon samgdeok samgang yangjo found resistant greenhouse openfield screening expression plant defenserelated gene jamyb osnpr ospra oswrky osprb observed resistant susceptible cultivar qrtpcr among five gene tested osprb showed coherent expression phenotype screening resistance xoo rice accurate conducted open field summer cultivation period greenhouse winter expression plant defenserelated gene bacterial inoculation could give another perspective elucidating defense mechanism using resistant susceptible individual,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
31767006,Rice defense responses are induced upon leaf rolling by an insect herbivore.,"Plant defense against herbivores begins with perception. The earlier plant detects the harm, the greater plant will benefit in its arm race with the herbivore. Before feeding, the larvae of the rice pest Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, initially spin silk and fold up a leaf. Rice can detect and protect itself against C. medinalis feeding. However, whether rice could perceive C. medinalis leaf rolling behavior is currently unknown. Here, we evaluated the role of leaf rolling by C. medinalis and artificial leaf rolling in rice plant defense and its indirect effect on two important C. medinalis parasitoids (Itoplectis naranyae and Apanteles sp.) through a combination of volatile profiling, gene-transcriptional and phytohormonal profiling. Natural leaf rolling by C. medinalis resulted in an increased attraction of I. naranyae when compared to the undamaged plant after 12 h. Volatile analysis revealed that six out of a total 22 components significantly increased in the headspace of C. medinalis rolled plant when compared to undamaged plant. Principal component analysis of these components revealed similarities in the headspace of undamaged plant and artificially rolled plant while the headspace volatiles of C. medinalis rolled plant deferred significantly. Leaf rolling and feeding by C. medinalis up-regulated the plant transcriptome and a series of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) related genes. While feeding significantly increased JA level after 12 to 36 h, rolling significantly increased SA level after 2 to 12 h. Compared to artificial rolling, natural rolling significantly increased JA level after 36 h and SA level after 2 and 12 h. Our findings suggest that natural leaf rolling by C. medinalis can be perceived by rice plant. The detection of this behavior may serve as an early warning signal in favor of the rice plant defenses against C. medinalis.",plant defense herbivore begin perception earlier plant detects harm greater plant benefit arm race herbivore feeding larva rice pest cnaphalocrocis medinalis initially spin silk fold leaf rice detect protect c medinalis feeding however whether rice could perceive c medinalis leaf rolling behavior currently unknown evaluated role leaf rolling c medinalis artificial leaf rolling rice plant defense indirect effect two important c medinalis parasitoids itoplectis naranyae apanteles sp combination volatile profiling genetranscriptional phytohormonal profiling natural leaf rolling c medinalis resulted increased attraction naranyae compared undamaged plant h volatile analysis revealed six total component significantly increased headspace c medinalis rolled plant compared undamaged plant principal component analysis component revealed similarity headspace undamaged plant artificially rolled plant headspace volatile c medinalis rolled plant deferred significantly leaf rolling feeding c medinalis upregulated plant transcriptome series jasmonic acid ja salicylic acid sa related gene feeding significantly increased ja level h rolling significantly increased sa level h compared artificial rolling natural rolling significantly increased ja level h sa level h finding suggest natural leaf rolling c medinalis perceived rice plant detection behavior may serve early warning signal favor rice plant defense c medinalis,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
31295286,Warming increases Bacterial Panicle Blight (Burkholderia glumae) occurrences and impacts on USA rice production.,"Bacterial Panicle Blight (BPB), caused by Burkholderia glumae, is a bacterial disease in rice (Oryza sativa) that reduces rice yield and quality for producers and consequently creates higher market prices for consumers. BPB is caused by the simultaneous occurrence of high daily minimum temperatures (~22°C) and relative humidity (~77%), which may increase under the current scenario of global warming. This study hypothesized that the economic damage from warming may cause an increase in economic losses, though at a decreasing rate per degree. Thus, this study estimates the yield losses associated with BPB occurrences at the county level in the Mid-South United States (US) for annual rice production in 2003-2013 and under +1-3°C warming scenarios using daily weather information with appropriate thresholds. From the estimated losses, the total production potential of a BPB-resistant rice was quantified using a spatial equilibrium trade model to further estimate market welfare changes with the counterfactual scenario that all US county-level rice production were BPB resistant. Results from the study indicate that the alleviation of BPB would represent a $69 million USD increase in consumer surplus in the US and a concomitant increase in rice production that would feed an additional 1.46 million people annually assuming a global average consumption of 54 Kg per person. Under the 1°C warming scenario, BPB occurrences and production losses would cause price increases for rice and subsequently result in a $112 million USD annual decrease in consumer surplus in the US and a loss of production equivalent to feeding 2.17 million people. Under a 3°C warming scenario, production losses due to BPB cause an annual reduction of $204 million USD in consumer surplus in the US, and a loss in production sufficient to feed 3.98 million people a year. As global warming intensifies, BPB could become a more common and formidable rice disease to combat, and breeding for BPB resistance would be the primary line-of-defense as currently no effective chemical options are available. The results of this study inform agriculturalists, policymakers, and economists about the value of BPB-resistance in the international rice market and also help support efforts to focus future breeding toward climate change impact resilience.",bacterial panicle blight bpb caused burkholderia glumae bacterial disease rice oryza sativa reduces rice yield quality producer consequently creates higher market price consumer bpb caused simultaneous occurrence high daily minimum temperature °c relative humidity may increase current scenario global warming study hypothesized economic damage warming may cause increase economic loss though decreasing rate per degree thus study estimate yield loss associated bpb occurrence county level midsouth united state u annual rice production °c warming scenario using daily weather information appropriate threshold estimated loss total production potential bpbresistant rice quantified using spatial equilibrium trade model estimate market welfare change counterfactual scenario u countylevel rice production bpb resistant result study indicate alleviation bpb would represent million usd increase consumer surplus u concomitant increase rice production would feed additional million people annually assuming global average consumption kg per person °c warming scenario bpb occurrence production loss would cause price increase rice subsequently result million usd annual decrease consumer surplus u loss production equivalent feeding million people °c warming scenario production loss due bpb cause annual reduction million usd consumer surplus u loss production sufficient feed million people year global warming intensifies bpb could become common formidable rice disease combat breeding bpb resistance would primary lineofdefense currently effective chemical option available result study inform agriculturalist policymakers economist value bpbresistance international rice market also help support effort focus future breeding toward climate change impact resilience,2,"{'Disease': ['burkholderia glumae bacterial disease rice oryza sativa', 'common formidable rice disease combat breeding bpb resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['currently effective chemical option', 'climate change impact resilience']}",0
39254868,Current status of molecular rice breeding for durable and broad-spectrum resistance to major diseases and insect pests.,"In the past century, there have been great achievements in identifying resistance (R) genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) as well as revealing the corresponding molecular mechanisms for resistance in rice to major diseases and insect pests. The introgression of R genes to develop resistant rice cultivars has become the most effective and eco-friendly method to control pathogens/insects at present. However, little attention has been paid to durable and broad-spectrum resistance, which determines the real applicability of R genes. Here, we summarize all the R genes and QTLs conferring durable and broad-spectrum resistance in rice to fungal blast, bacterial leaf blight (BLB), and the brown planthopper (BPH) in molecular breeding. We discuss the molecular mechanisms and feasible methods of improving durable and broad-spectrum resistance to blast, BLB, and BPH. We will particularly focus on pyramiding multiple R genes or QTLs as the most useful method to improve durability and broaden the disease/insect spectrum in practical breeding regardless of its uncertainty.

24837876,Production of a saccharifying rice malt for brewing using different rice varieties and malting parameters.,"This study was conducted to produce rice malt suitable for beer brewing. An all-rice beer would be particularly appealing to individuals with celiac disease because rice does not contain gluten proteins. Furthermore, rice malt could also contribute to new beer flavors and brands. A screening of 10 rice varieties was conducted. The varieties Balilla and Centauro were found to be suitable for the production of an all-rice malt beer without the need of exogenous enzymes. They were characterized by a low diastatic power but nevertheless they saccharified well, likely due to other endogenous amylolytic enzymes such as limit dextrinase and α-glucosidase. The addition of CaCl2 and lactic acid during mashing lowered the pH value and increased saccharification. However, the Balilla variety saccharified without the need of these additives. We also show that the soluble nitrogen and free amino nitrogen content of rice malt wort can be increased by the incorporation of the acrospires and rootlets during mashing.",study conducted produce rice malt suitable beer brewing allrice beer would particularly appealing individual celiac disease rice contain gluten protein furthermore rice malt could also contribute new beer flavor brand screening rice variety conducted variety balilla centauro found suitable production allrice malt beer without need exogenous enzyme characterized low diastatic power nevertheless saccharified well likely due endogenous amylolytic enzyme limit dextrinase αglucosidase addition cacl lactic acid mashing lowered ph value increased saccharification however balilla variety saccharified without need additive also show soluble nitrogen free amino nitrogen content rice malt wort increased incorporation acrospires rootlet mashing,2,"{'Disease': ['individual celiac disease rice contain'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

The development of resistant cultivars is considered an efficient and sustainable approach to mitigate rice yield reduction. In the present study, we describe the development of japonica rice introgression lines with multiple resistance genes (MR lines), resistant to four different types of biotic stresses, and compare the agronomic performance, yield, and grain quality parameters of these lines with those of the recurrent parent. A total of nine MR lines were developed by marker-assisted backcrossing, which combined five single-R genes in a japonica background with a minimum of linkage drag. All the MR lines harbored the R genes Bph18 and qSTV11<sup>SG</sup> and two Pi genes (Pib + Pik) in common, offering resistance to brown planthopper (BPH), rice stripe virus (RSV), and rice blast disease, respectively. In the case of bacterial blight (BB), Xa40 was detected in only five out of the nine and Xa3 was validated in the others. In particular, the five MR lines pyramiding the R genes (Bph18 + qSTV11SG + Pib + Pik) in combination with Xa40 showed stable resistance to all bioassays for BPH, BB, blast, and RSV. The MR lines did not show any negative effects on the main agronomic traits, including yield production and rice grain quality.

27129414,Rice false smut fungus hijacks the rice nutrients supply by blocking and mimicking the fertilization of rice ovary.,"Rice false smut disease is an increasing threat to rice production in the world. Despite of best efforts, research for the infection of the fungus has yielded equivocal and conflicting results about where and how the infection is initiated and developed. Here we show a stepwise infection pattern and sophisticated regulation during this process. Initial infection occurred on the filaments, which prevented the production of mature pollen thus blocked the pollination. In the following days, the pathogen invaded the stigmas and styles, occasionally the ovaries. Expression analysis indicated that the fungus mimicked a successful fertilization process and enabled the continuous supply of nutrients for fungus to produce false smut balls. The stepwise infection of flower organs and mimicry of ovary fertilization unveiled in this study guided the rice plant into supplying nutrients for false smut ball development and represents a new and unique biological process of host pathogen interactions.",rice false smut disease increasing threat rice production world despite best effort research infection fungus yielded equivocal conflicting result infection initiated developed show stepwise infection pattern sophisticated regulation process initial infection occurred filament prevented production mature pollen thus blocked pollination following day pathogen invaded stigma style occasionally ovary expression analysis indicated fungus mimicked successful fertilization process enabled continuous supply nutrient fungus produce false smut ball stepwise infection flower organ mimicry ovary fertilization unveiled study guided rice plant supplying nutrient false smut ball development represents new unique biological process host pathogen interaction,3,"{'Disease': ['rice false smut disease', 'best effort research infection fungus', 'fungus mimicked successful fertilization process', 'continuous supply nutrient fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
17913077,Transgenic rice plants expressing a novel antifreeze glycopeptide possess resistance to cold and disease.,"Freezing injury and disease are both restrictive factors in crop production. In order to improve the tolerance ability to these stresses, a better way is to carry out genetic engineering by transferring dualfunctional genes. A predicted rice antifreeze glycopeptide gene was purposefully selected from rice blast-induced cDNA library. Northern blot demonstrated that the gene is expressed not only in blast-infected rice leaves, but also in low temperature-treated rice. In addition, the expressed protein in Escherichia coli exhibits strong antifreeze activities. The gene was overexpressed in rice plants transformed via Agrobacterium tumefacient EHA105. Overall 112 T0 transformants were obtained in this research. Cold tolerance and disease resistance of T1 transformants were, respectively, investigated. The results showed that plants containing overexpressed transgene can withstand -1 degrees C for 24 h without severe chilling injury after thawed, and that disease symptoms of the parallel transformants are highly reduced in response to blast infection, when compared with controls. The relationship of the gene and several pathogenesis-related protein genes to be chosen was analyzed and discussed. All these results confirmed the dual role of the cloned gene, and implied that genetic engineering using this kind of gene is a promising method to reduce biotic and abiotic stresses.",freezing injury disease restrictive factor crop production order improve tolerance ability stress better way carry genetic engineering transferring dualfunctional gene predicted rice antifreeze glycopeptide gene purposefully selected rice blastinduced cdna library northern blot demonstrated gene expressed blastinfected rice leaf also low temperaturetreated rice addition expressed protein escherichia coli exhibit strong antifreeze activity gene overexpressed rice plant transformed via agrobacterium tumefacient eha overall transformants obtained research cold tolerance disease resistance transformants respectively investigated result showed plant containing overexpressed transgene withstand degree c h without severe chilling injury thawed disease symptom parallel transformants highly reduced response blast infection compared control relationship gene several pathogenesisrelated protein gene chosen analyzed discussed result confirmed dual role cloned gene implied genetic engineering using kind gene promising method reduce biotic abiotic stress,2,"{'Disease': ['freezing injury disease restrictive factor crop production order', 'research cold tolerance disease resistance transformants', 'severe chilling injury thawed disease symptom parallel transformants'], 'Treatment': ['promising method'], 'Symptom': ['severe chilling injury thawed disease symptom parallel transformants']}",1
24521476,A systems-wide comparison of red rice (Oryza longistaminata) tissues identifies rhizome specific genes and proteins that are targets for cultivated rice improvement.,"The rhizome, the original stem of land plants, enables species to invade new territory and is a critical component of perenniality, especially in grasses. Red rice (Oryza longistaminata) is a perennial wild rice species with many valuable traits that could be used to improve cultivated rice cultivars, including rhizomatousness, disease resistance and drought tolerance. Despite these features, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that contribute to rhizome growth, development and function in this plant. We used an integrated approach to compare the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the rhizome to other tissues of red rice. 116 Gb of transcriptome sequence was obtained from various tissues and used to identify rhizome-specific and preferentially expressed genes, including transcription factors and hormone metabolism and stress response-related genes. Proteomics and metabolomics approaches identified 41 proteins and more than 100 primary metabolites and plant hormones with rhizome preferential accumulation. Of particular interest was the identification of a large number of gene transcripts from Magnaportha oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast disease in cultivated rice, even though the red rice plants showed no sign of disease. A significant set of genes, proteins and metabolites appear to be specifically or preferentially expressed in the rhizome of O. longistaminata.

Fluazinam is a protective dinitroaniline fungicide which could interrupt the fungal cell's energy production. Little is known about the effects of fluazinam on F. fujikuroi. In this study, baseline sensitivity of F. fujikuroi to fluazinam was determined using 103 isolates collected from diseased young rice of different fields in Shaoxing of Zhejiang Province and Huaian of Jiangsu Province of China in 2016. The EC<sub>50</sub> values of fluazinam on inhibiting mycelial growth against 103 isolates of F. fujikuroi ranged from 0.0621 to 0.5446 μg/mL with the average value of 0.2038 ± 0.0099 μg/mL (mean ± standard error). The EC<sub>50</sub> values of fluazinam on suppressing conidium germination against 103 isolates of F. fujikuroi ranged from 0.1006 to 0.9763 μg/mL with the mean value of 0.3552 ± 0.0181 μg/mL.

The discovery and application of broad-spectrum resistance genes are of great advance for disease resistance breeding. Previously, we identified that multiple <i>receptor-like kinase (RLK)</i> family gene deletions induced by the <i>Ac/Ds</i> system resulted in a lesion mimic symptom. In this study, the mutant #29 showed that this lesion mimic symptom was isolated. Further analysis identified that four <i>RLK</i> genes <i>(</i><i>RLK19-22)</i> were deleted in the #29 mutant. The #29 mutant exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to <i>Xoo</i> and subsequent analyses identified that pathogenesis-related genes <i>PR1a, PBZ1</i>, and cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were significantly induced in the mutant compared to wild-type plants. A genetic analysis revealed that reconstruction of <i>RLK20</i>, <i>RLK21,</i> or <i>RLK22</i> rescued the lesion mimic symptom of the #29 mutant, indicating that these three <i>RLKs</i> are responsible for broad-spectrum resistance in rice. Further yeast two hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that RLK20 interacts with RBOHB, which is a ROS producer in plants. Compared to wild-type plants, the #29 mutant was more, while #29/<i>RLK20</i><i>ox</i> was less, susceptible to MV (methyl-viologen), an ROS inducer. Co-expression of <i>RLK20</i> and <i>RBOHB</i> reduced RBOHB-promoted H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in the cells.

28008850,Pathogen effectors and plant immunity determine specialization of the blast fungus to rice subspecies.,"Understanding how fungi specialize on their plant host is crucial for developing sustainable disease control. A traditional, centuries-old rice agro-system of the Yuanyang terraces was used as a model to show that virulence effectors of the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzaeh</i> play a key role in its specialization on locally grown indica or japonica local rice subspecies.

Numerous studies have shown that breeding resistant rice varieties is one of the most effective methods to prevent BB, and it is important to identify and isolate more BB resistance (R) genes from different rice resources. Using a map-based approach, we identified a new QTL/gene, Xa43(t), from ZhangPu wild rice, which was highly resistant to the BB isolate PX099. We performed bulked segregant analysis combined with candidate gene prediction to identify the candidate gene. The Xa43(t) gene was narrowed down to a 29-kb region containing four putative genes. More importantly, the candidate gene Xa43(t) did not affect the main agronomic traits of rice. We also identified a widely applicable molecular marker, namely Inde1-18, which co-segregates with the Xa43(t) gene.

17601827,Rice WRKY45 plays a crucial role in benzothiadiazole-inducible blast resistance.,"Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a so-called plant activator and protects plants from diseases by activating the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway. By microarray screening, we identified BTH- and SA-inducible WRKY transcription factor (TF) genes that were upregulated within 3 h after BTH treatment. Overexpression of one of them, WRKY45, in rice (Oryza sativa) markedly enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of WRKY45 compromised BTH-inducible resistance to blast disease, indicating that it is essential for BTH-induced defense responses. In a transient expression system, WRKY45 activated reporter gene transcription through W-boxes. Epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY45 acts in the SA signaling pathway independently of NH1, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1, which distinguishes WRKY45 from known Arabidopsis WRKY TFs. Two defense-related genes, encoding a glutathione S-transferase and a cytochrome P450, were found to be regulated downstream of WRKY45 but were not regulated by NH1, consistent with the apparent independence of the WRKY45- and NH1-dependent pathways. Defense gene expression in WRKY45-overexpressed rice plants varied with growth conditions, suggesting that some environmental factor(s) acts downstream of WRKY45 transcription. We propose a role for WRKY45 in BTH-induced and SA-mediated defense signaling in rice and its potential utility in improving disease resistance of rice, an importance food resource worldwide.",benzothiadiazole bth socalled plant activator protects plant disease activating salicylic acid sa signaling pathway microarray screening identified bth sainducible wrky transcription factor tf gene upregulated within h bth treatment overexpression one wrky rice oryza sativa markedly enhanced resistance rice blast fungus rna interferencemediated knockdown wrky compromised bthinducible resistance blast disease indicating essential bthinduced defense response transient expression system wrky activated reporter gene transcription wboxes epistasis analysis suggested wrky act sa signaling pathway independently nh rice ortholog arabidopsis thaliana npr distinguishes wrky known arabidopsis wrky tfs two defenserelated gene encoding glutathione stransferase cytochrome p found regulated downstream wrky regulated nh consistent apparent independence wrky nhdependent pathway defense gene expression wrkyoverexpressed rice plant varied growth condition suggesting environmental factor act downstream wrky transcription propose role wrky bthinduced samediated defense signaling rice potential utility improving disease resistance rice importance food resource worldwide,2,"{'Disease': ['plant disease', 'one wrky rice oryza sativa markedly enhanced resistance rice blast fungus rna', 'bthinducible resistance blast disease', 'disease resistance rice importance food resource'], 'Treatment': ['h bth treatment overexpression'], 'Symptom': []}",1
21140255,"Fine mapping of qSTV11TQ, a major gene conferring resistance to rice stripe disease.","The indica rice cultivar, Teqing, shows a high level of resistance to rice stripe virus (RSV). It is believed that this resistance is controlled by the gene, qSTV11(TQ). For positional cloning of the resistance gene, a set of chromosome single segment substitution lines (CSSSLs) was constructed, all of which had the genetic background of the susceptible japonica cultivar, Lemont, with different single substituted segments of Teqing on chromosome 11. By identifying the resistance of the CSSSLs-2006 in a field within a heavily diseased area, the resistance gene qSTV11(TQ) was mapped between the markers Indel7 and RM229. Furthermore, in that region, six new markers were developed and 52 subregion CSSSLs (CSSSLs-2007) were constructed. The natural infection experiment was conducted again at different sites, with two replicates used in each site in order to identify the resistance phenotypes of the CSSSLs-2007 and resistant/susceptible controls in 2007. Through the results of 2007, qSTV11(TQ) was localized in a region defined by the markers, CAPs1 and Indel4. In order to further confirm the position of qSTV11(TQ), another set of subregion CSSSLs (CSSSLs-2009) was constructed.

We herein report a rare Japanese case of rice-induced FPIES. A six-month-old, female, Japanese patient presented to the emergency room (ER) with the complaint of vomiting after feeding. Postprandial vomiting had occurred occasionally since she started ingesting solid food at the age of 5 months. Rice-induced FPIES was suspected only after the fourth ER visit based on the characteristic history of recurrent vomiting occurring 1-2 h after ingesting food containing rice. Allergen-specific IgE testing and a skin prick test with an allergen scratch extract were both negative for rice. During an oral food challenge test (OFC), vomiting was observed after the patient ingested 2 g of rice porridge. Based on the OFC results and the entire clinical course, FPIES due to rice was diagnosed. A lymphocyte stimulation test with rice revealed a significantly elevated stimulation index. Rice-induced FPIES is rarely reported among Japanese infants despite rice being a staple in the Japanese diet. The prevalence of rice-induced FPIES differs greatly among populations, suggesting a multifactorial cause associated with its development. Delays in diagnosis are common in FPIES, and our case demonstrates the importance of obtaining a dietary history of food ingested prior to symptom onset in cases of infantile repetitive vomiting.",food proteininduced enterocolitis syndrome fpies nonigemediated gastrointestinal food allergy characterized repetitive vomiting within h andor diarrhea within h ingesting causative food herein report rare japanese case riceinduced fpies sixmonthold female japanese patient presented emergency room er complaint vomiting feeding postprandial vomiting occurred occasionally since started ingesting solid food age month riceinduced fpies suspected fourth er visit based characteristic history recurrent vomiting occurring h ingesting food containing rice allergenspecific ige testing skin prick test allergen scratch extract negative rice oral food challenge test ofc vomiting observed patient ingested g rice porridge based ofc result entire clinical course fpies due rice diagnosed lymphocyte stimulation test rice revealed significantly elevated stimulation index riceinduced fpies rarely reported among japanese infant despite rice staple japanese diet prevalence riceinduced fpies differs greatly among population suggesting multifactorial cause associated development delay diagnosis common fpies case demonstrates importance obtaining dietary history food ingested prior symptom onset case infantile repetitive vomiting,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['prior symptom onset case']}",2

In this research, a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population of 81 lines derived from a cross of Kinmaze (japonica)/DV85(indica) by the single seed descent method was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to rice stripe virus(RSV). The response of the two parents and 81 RILs to RSV were investigated by inoculating seedlings with viruliferous small brown planthopper insects, and scored by the disease rate index. The quantitative trait loci for rice stripe disease resistance were analyzed by QTL Cartographer software. Three QTL controlling RSV resistance were detected on chromosomes 1, 7 and 11, respectively. Individual QTL accounted for 19.8%-30.9% of the phenotypic variance in the RILs population. The direction of the additive gene effects at two loci qStv7 and qStv11 coincided with that predicted by phenotypes of the parents.

The white-backed planthopper (WBPH) and brown planthopper (BPH) are vectors of Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) and Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV), respectively, which cause serious rice diseases. We herein describe the effects of SRBSDV and RRSV infections on host-selection behaviour of vector and non-vector planthoppers at different disease stages. The Y-tube olfactometer choice and free-choice tests indicated that SRBSDV and RRSV infections altered the attractiveness of rice plants to vector and non-vector planthoppers. The attractiveness was mainly mediated by rice volatiles, and varied with disease progression. The attractiveness of the SRBSDV- or RRSV-infected rice plants to the virus-free WBPHs or BPHs initially decreased, then increased, and finally decreased again.

10571882,Short communication: developmental control of Xa21-mediated disease resistance in rice.,"The rice resistance gene Xa21 confers resistance against the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The molecular genetic mechanism controlling the integration of the Xa21-mediated disease resistance response with the developmental program in rice is under study in this model system. Reproducible means of infecting plants at certain developmental stages were designed based on the timing of full expansion of the leaf. Xa21-resistance progressively increases from the susceptible juvenile leaf 2 stage through later stages, with 100% resistance at the adult leaf 9/10 stage. We found that Xa21 expression is independent of plant developmental stage, infection with Xoo, or wounding. Expression of the Xa21 gene transcript is not correlated with expression of Xa21 disease resistance indicating that the developmental regulation of Xa21-resistance is either controlled post-transcriptionally or by other factors.",rice resistance gene xa confers resistance bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo molecular genetic mechanism controlling integration xamediated disease resistance response developmental program rice study model system reproducible mean infecting plant certain developmental stage designed based timing full expansion leaf xaresistance progressively increase susceptible juvenile leaf stage later stage resistance adult leaf stage found xa expression independent plant developmental stage infection xoo wounding expression xa gene transcript correlated expression xa disease resistance indicating developmental regulation xaresistance either controlled posttranscriptionally factor,3,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance response developmental program rice study model system reproducible mean infecting plant certain developmental stage', 'wounding expression xa gene transcript correlated expression xa disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

Rice growth was inhibited by d-psicose but not by common sugars. Microarray analysis revealed that d-psicose treatment caused an upregulation of many defense-related genes in rice, and dose-dependent upregulation of these genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The level of upregulation of defense-related genes by d-psicose was low compared with that by d-allose, which is another rare sugar known to confer induction of resistance to rice bacterial blight in rice. Treatment with d-psicose conferred resistance to bacterial blight in rice in a dose-dependent manner, and the results indicate that d-psicose might be a candidate plant activator for reducing disease development in rice.",examined rice response rare sugar dpsicose rice growth inhibited dpsicose common sugar microarray analysis revealed dpsicose treatment caused upregulation many defenserelated gene rice dosedependent upregulation gene confirmed quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction level upregulation defenserelated gene dpsicose low compared dallose another rare sugar known confer induction resistance rice bacterial blight rice treatment dpsicose conferred resistance bacterial blight rice dosedependent manner result indicate dpsicose might candidate plant activator reducing disease development rice,2,"{'Disease': ['disease development rice'], 'Treatment': ['dpsicose treatment', 'another rare sugar known confer induction resistance rice bacterial blight rice treatment dpsicose conferred resistance bacterial blight rice dosedependent manner result'], 'Symptom': []}",0
35667655,The Vital Role of ShTHIC from the Endophyte OsiSh-2 in Thiamine Biosynthesis and Blast Resistance in the OsiSh-2-Rice Symbiont.,"Endophytes can benefit the growth and stress resistance of host plants by secreting bioactive components. Thiamine is an essential vitamin involved in many metabolic pathways and can only be synthesized by microbes and plants. In this study, we found that thiamine could inhibit the development of the phytopathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and decrease the rice blast index under field conditions. In the thiamine biosynthesis pathway, the key enzyme ShTHIC of an endophyte <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i> OsiSh-2 and OsTHIC of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) were highly homologous. Gene overexpression or knockout approaches revealed that both THIC contributed to thiamine synthesis and resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Furthermore, <i>S. hygroscopicus</i> OsiSh-2 colonization led to a decrease in the thiamine synthesis level of rice but still maintained thiamine homeostasis in rice. However, inoculation with the ShTHIC knockout strain Δ<i>THIC</i> reduced the thiamine content in rice, although the thiamine synthesis level of rice was increased. After infection with <i>M. oryzae</i>, blast resistance was dramatically improved in OsiSh-2-inoculated rice but decreased in Δ<i>THIC</i>-inoculated rice compared with non-inoculated rice. This result demonstrated that <i>ShTHIC</i> could regulate thiamine biosynthesis and consequently assist blast resistance in the OsiSh-2-rice symbiont.

34027391,The <i>Xa7</i> resistance gene guards the rice susceptibility gene <i>SWEET14</i> against exploitation by the bacterial blight pathogen.,"Many plant disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes function specifically in reaction to the presence of cognate effectors from a pathogen. <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pathovar <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) uses transcription activator-like effectors (TALes) to target specific rice genes for expression, thereby promoting host susceptibility to bacterial blight. Here, we report the molecular characterization of <i>Xa7</i>, the cognate <i>R</i> gene to the TALes AvrXa7 and PthXo3, which target the rice major susceptibility gene <i>SWEET14</i>. <i>Xa7</i> was mapped to a unique 74-kb region.

This study investigates the potential of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (SN13) as a biocontrol agent in the sensitive rice variety Swarna against R. solani infection. Disease incidence analysis reveals untreated rice plants suffer from R. solani infection, while SN13 treatment effectively suppresses fungal growth. In detached leaf assays, SN13 mitigates R. solani-induced damage, and physio-biochemical analyses indicate improved growth in SN13-treated rice plants. Notably, treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, increases disease incidence, whereas SN13 treatment enhances the formation of autophagosomes stained with Mono Dansyl Cadaverine (MDC) dye, as observed through confocal microscopy, suggesting the involvement of autophagy in plant defense against R. solani. Gene expression analysis reveals alterations in ATG and defence-related genes (BZ1, 5H5, and 8A1), affirming that SN13 activates autophagy and bolsters plant resilience. Metabolite analysis using GC-MS indicates the accumulation of defence signalling molecules such as gluconic acid, arabitol, glucopyranoside, ribose, xylopyranose, and arabinofuranoside.

29746473,Detection of rice sheath blight using an unmanned aerial system with high-resolution color and multispectral imaging.,"Detection and monitoring are the first essential step for effective management of sheath blight (ShB), a major disease in rice worldwide. Unmanned aerial systems have a high potential of being utilized to improve this detection process since they can reduce the time needed for scouting for the disease at a field scale, and are affordable and user-friendly in operation. In this study, a commercialized quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with digital and multispectral cameras, was used to capture imagery data of research plots with 67 rice cultivars and elite lines. Collected imagery data were then processed and analyzed to characterize the development of ShB and quantify different levels of the disease in the field. Through color features extraction and color space transformation of images, it was found that the color transformation could qualitatively detect the infected areas of ShB in the field plots. However, it was less effective to detect different levels of the disease. Five vegetation indices were then calculated from the multispectral images, and ground truths of disease severity and GreenSeeker measured NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were collected. The results of relationship analyses indicate that there was a strong correlation between ground-measured NDVIs and image-extracted NDVIs with the R2 of 0.907 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0854, and a good correlation between image-extracted NDVIs and disease severity with the R2 of 0.627 and the RMSE of 0.0852. Use of image-based NDVIs extracted from multispectral images could quantify different levels of ShB in the field plots with an accuracy of 63%.

34246801,Bph30 confers resistance to brown planthopper by fortifying sclerenchyma in rice leaf sheaths.,"Phloem-feeding insects cause massive losses in agriculture and horticulture. Host plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects is often mediated by changes in phloem composition, which deter insect settling and feeding and decrease viability. Here, we report that rice plant resistance to the phloem-feeding brown planthopper (BPH) is associated with fortification of the sclerenchyma tissue, which is located just beneath the epidermis and a cell layer or two away from the vascular bundle in the rice leaf sheath. We found that BPHs prefer to feed on the smooth and soft region on the surface of rice leaf sheaths called the long-cell block. We identified Bph30 as a rice BPH resistance gene that prevents BPH stylets from reaching the phloem due to the fortified sclerenchyma. Bph30 is strongly expressed in sclerenchyma cells and enhances cellulose and hemicellulose synthesis, making the cell walls stiffer and sclerenchyma thicker. The structurally fortified sclerenchyma is a formidable barrier preventing BPH stylets from penetrating the leaf sheath tissues and arriving at the phloem to feed. Bph30 belongs to a novel gene family, encoding a protein with two leucine-rich domains. Another member of the family, Bph40, also conferred resistance to BPH. Collectively, the fortified sclerenchyma-mediated resistance mechanism revealed in this study expands our understanding of plant-insect interactions and opens a new path for controlling planthoppers in rice.",phloemfeeding insect cause massive loss agriculture horticulture host plant resistance phloemfeeding insect often mediated change phloem composition deter insect settling feeding decrease viability report rice plant resistance phloemfeeding brown planthopper bph associated fortification sclerenchyma tissue located beneath epidermis cell layer two away vascular bundle rice leaf sheath found bph prefer feed smooth soft region surface rice leaf sheath called longcell block identified bph rice bph resistance gene prevents bph stylet reaching phloem due fortified sclerenchyma bph strongly expressed sclerenchyma cell enhances cellulose hemicellulose synthesis making cell wall stiffer sclerenchyma thicker structurally fortified sclerenchyma formidable barrier preventing bph stylet penetrating leaf sheath tissue arriving phloem feed bph belongs novel gene family encoding protein two leucinerich domain another member family bph also conferred resistance bph collectively fortified sclerenchymamediated resistance mechanism revealed study expands understanding plantinsect interaction open new path controlling planthopper rice,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2

37177781,The E3 ubiquitin ligase OsRGLG5 targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPi9 confers basal resistance against rice blast.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. During infection, M. oryzae secretes effectors to facilitate blast development. Among these effectors, the avirulence factor AvrPi9 is recognized by Pi9, a broad-spectrum blast resistance protein that triggers Pi9-mediated resistance in rice. However, little is known about the interaction between AvrPi9 and Pi9 and how AvrPi9 exerts virulence to promote infection. In this study, we found that ectopic expression of AvrPi9 in the Pi9-lacking cultivar TP309 suppressed basal resistance against M. oryzae. Furthermore, we identified an AvrPi9-interacting protein in rice, which we named OsRGLG5, encoding a functional RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. During infection, AvrPi9 was ubiquitinated and degraded by OsRGLG5. Meanwhile, AvrPi9 affected the stability of OsRGLG5. Infection assays revealed that OsRGLG5 is a positive regulator of basal resistance against M. oryzae, but it is not essential for Pi9-mediated blast resistance in rice.

34960733,Metatranscriptomic Sequencing Suggests the Presence of Novel RNA Viruses in Rice Transmitted by Brown Planthopper.,"Viral pathogens are a major threat to stable crop production.

However, when <i>Bph3</i>-carrying backcross lines are infested with BPH, these BPH-resistant lines exhibit sterile characteristics, displaying panicle enclosure and failure of seed production at their mature stage. As we suspected, BPH-mediated viral infections could cause the observed sterile symptoms, and we characterized rice-infecting viruses using deep metatranscriptomic sequencing. Our analyses revealed eight novel virus species and five known viruses, including a highly divergent virus clustered within a currently unclassified family. Additionally, we characterized rice plant antiviral responses using small RNA sequencing. The results revealed abundant virus-derived small interfering RNAs in sterile rice plants, providing evidence for Dicer-like and Argonaute-mediated immune responses in rice plants.

34608951,The metabolomic landscape of rice heterosis highlights pathway biomarkers for predicting complex phenotypes.,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complex phenotypes requires systematic analyses of complicated metabolic networks and contributes to improvements in the breeding efficiency of staple cereal crops and diagnostic accuracy for human diseases. Here, we selected rice (Oryza sativa) heterosis as a complex phenotype and investigated the mechanisms of both vegetative and reproductive traits using an untargeted metabolomics strategy. Heterosis-associated analytes were identified, and the overlapping analytes were shown to underlie the association patterns for six agronomic traits. The heterosis-associated analytes of four yield components and plant height collectively contributed to yield heterosis, and the degree of contribution differed among the five traits. We performed dysregulated network analyses of the high- and low-better parent heterosis hybrids and found multiple types of metabolic pathways involved in heterosis. The metabolite levels of the significantly enriched pathways (especially those from amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism) were predictive of yield heterosis (area under the curve = 0.907 with 10 features), and the predictability of these pathway biomarkers was validated with hybrids across environments and populations.

22547659,Brassinosteroid action in flowering plants: a Darwinian perspective.,"The year 2012 marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's first botanical book, on the fertilization of orchids (1862), wherein he described pollen grains and outlined his evolutionary principles with respect to plant research. Five decades later, the growth-promoting effect of extracts of Orchid pollen on coleoptile elongation was documented. These studies led to the discovery of a new class of phytohormones, the brassinosteroids (BRs) that were isolated from rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen. These growth-promoting steroids, which regulate height, fertility, and seed-filling in crop plants such as rice (Oryza sativa), also induce stress- and disease resistance in green algae and angiosperms. The origin and current status of BR-research is described here, with reference to BR-action and -signal transduction, and it is shown that modern high-yield rice varieties with erect leaves are deficient in endogenous BRs. Since brassinosteroids induce pathogen resistance in rice plants and hence can suppress rice blast- and bacterial blight-diseases, genetic manipulation of BR-biosynthesis or -perception may be a means to increase crop production. Basic research on BR activity in plants, such as Arabidopsis and rice, has the potential to increase crop yields further as part of a 21th century 'green biotech-revolution' that can be traced back to Darwin's classical breeding experiments. It is concluded that 'Nothing in brassinosteroid research makes sense except in the light of Darwinian evolution' and the value of basic science is highlighted, with reference to the genetic engineering of better food crops that may become resistant to a variety of plant diseases.",year mark th anniversary publication charles darwin first botanical book fertilization orchid wherein described pollen grain outlined evolutionary principle respect plant research five decade later growthpromoting effect extract orchid pollen coleoptile elongation documented study led discovery new class phytohormone brassinosteroids br isolated rapeseed brassica napu pollen growthpromoting steroid regulate height fertility seedfilling crop plant rice oryza sativa also induce stress disease resistance green algae angiosperm origin current status brresearch described reference braction signal transduction shown modern highyield rice variety erect leaf deficient endogenous br since brassinosteroids induce pathogen resistance rice plant hence suppress rice blast bacterial blightdiseases genetic manipulation brbiosynthesis perception may mean increase crop production basic research br activity plant arabidopsis rice potential increase crop yield part th century green biotechrevolution traced back darwin classical breeding experiment concluded nothing brassinosteroid research make sense except light darwinian evolution value basic science highlighted reference genetic engineering better food crop may become resistant variety plant disease,2,"{'Disease': ['stress disease resistance green algae angiosperm origin current status brresearch described reference braction signal transduction', 'rice blast bacterial blightdiseases genetic manipulation brbiosynthesis perception', 'resistant variety plant disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['five decade later growthpromoting effect extract']}",4

An elite, early-maturing, high-yielding Malaysian rice variety, MR263, is susceptible to blast and was used as the recurrent parent in this study. To improve MR263 disease resistance, the Pongsu Seribu 1 rice variety was used as donor of the blast resistance Pi-7(t), Pi-d(t)1 and Pir2-3(t) genes and qLN2 quantitative trait locus (QTL). The objective was to introgress these blast resistance genes into the background of MR263 using marker-assisted backcrossing with both foreground and background selection.

34171481,Gapless indica rice genome reveals synergistic contributions of active transposable elements and segmental duplications to rice genome evolution.,"The ultimate goal of genome assembly is a high-accuracy gapless genome. Here, we report a new assembly pipeline that is used to produce a gapless genome for the indica rice cultivar Minghui 63. The resulting 397.71-Mb final assembly is composed of 12 contigs with a contig N50 size of 31.93 Mb. Each chromosome is represented by a single contig and the genomic sequences of all chromosomes are gapless. Quality evaluation of this gapless genome assembly showed that gene regions in our assembly have the highest completeness compared with the other 15 reported high-quality rice genomes. Further comparison with the japonica rice genome revealed that the gapless indica genome assembly contains more transposable elements (TEs) and segmental duplications (SDs), the latter of which produce many duplicated genes that can affect agronomic traits through dose effect or sub-/neo-functionalization. The insertion of TEs can also affect the expression of duplicated genes, which may drive the evolution of these genes. Furthermore, we found the expansion of nucleotide-binding site with leucine-rich repeat disease-resistance genes and cis-zeatin-O-glucosyltransferase growth-related genes in SDs in the gapless indica genome assembly, suggesting that SDs contribute to the adaptive evolution of rice disease resistance and developmental processes.

15756856,"The assessment of the rice cultivars/lines resistance to blast disease in Mazandaran province, Iran.","Blast, caused by Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most important diseases in rice production regions of the world including Iran. To determine progress of rice blast disease on the selective cultivars and lines also to assay some components of partial resistance, a set of Iranian rice cultivars (Local and breeding) along with near-isogenic lines (NILs) and breeding lines from International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) were tested with some field races of the fungus in blast nursery and five of selective races in greenhouse. These experiments were conducted in a Randomized complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications (except greenhouse experiment on the leaves). Traits in this study consisted of Infection Neck Number (INN), Neck Lesion Size (NLS), Infection Type (IT), percent Diseased Leaf Area (DLA) and Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC); also IT, Sporulation Lesion Number (SLN), Sporulating Region Diameter (SRD) and percent DLA were measured in leaf blast in greenhouse (one replication). The Iranian local cultivars and NILs i.e. Co-39 and C104-PKT located as susceptible group for AUDPC, IT, INN and NLS. Iranian breeding cultivars, breeding lines from IRRI and NILs (except Co-39 and C104-PKT) were resistant or indicated hypersensivity reaction (HR). Some cultivars (Fujiminori, Onda, and Hassan Saraii) were semi susceptible to leaf blast in nursery.

In this report, we found that YCWE treatment triggered rice cell suspension cultures to accumulate phenylalanine (Phe), cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), 12-hydroxyjasmonoyle isoleucine (12OHJA-Ile), and azelaic acid (AzA). YCWE treatment also reduced endogenous triacylglycerol (TG) content. The addition of <sup>13</sup>C-uniform-labeled oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids to the rice cell suspension cultures gave rise to <sup>13</sup>C-uniform-labeled AzA. It was also found that YCWE treatment for Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in accumulations of OPDA, AzA, Phe, and camalexin together with enhanced resistance against Botrytis cinerea infection.

33894749,Highly efficient generation of bacterial leaf blight-resistant and transgene-free rice using a genome editing and multiplexed selection system.,"Rice leaf blight, which is a devastating disease worldwide, is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The upregulated by transcription activator-like 1 (UPT) effector box in the promoter region of the rice Xa13 gene plays a key role in Xoo pathogenicity. Mutation of a key bacterial protein-binding site in the UPT box of Xa13 to abolish PXO99-induced Xa13 expression is a way to improve rice resistance to bacteria. Highly efficient generation and selection of transgene-free edited plants are helpful to shorten and simplify the gene editing-based breeding process. Selective elimination of transgenic pollen of T0 plants can enrich the proportion of T1 transgene-free offspring, and expression of a color marker gene in seeds makes the selection of T2 plants very convenient and efficient. In this study, a genome editing and multiplexed selection system was used to generate bacterial leaf blight-resistant and transgene-free rice plants. We introduced site-specific mutations into the UPT box using CRISPR/Cas12a technology to hamper with transcription-activator-like effector (TAL) protein binding and gene activation and generated genome-edited rice with improved bacterial blight resistance. Transgenic pollen of T0 plants was eliminated by pollen-specific expression of the α-amylase gene Zmaa1, and the proportion of transgene-free plants increased from 25 to 50% among single T-DNA insertion events in the T1 generation. Transgenic seeds were visually identified and discarded by specific aleuronic expression of DsRed, which reduced the cost by 50% and led to up to 98.64% accuracy for the selection of transgene-free edited plants. We demonstrated that core nucleotide deletion in the UPT box of the Xa13 promoter conferred resistance to rice blight, and selection of transgene-free plants was boosted by introducing multiplexed selection. The combination of genome editing and transgene-free selection is an efficient strategy to accelerate functional genomic research and plant breeding.",rice leaf blight devastating disease worldwide caused bacterium xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo upregulated transcription activatorlike upt effector box promoter region rice xa gene play key role xoo pathogenicity mutation key bacterial proteinbinding site upt box xa abolish pxoinduced xa expression way improve rice resistance bacteria highly efficient generation selection transgenefree edited plant helpful shorten simplify gene editingbased breeding process selective elimination transgenic pollen plant enrich proportion transgenefree offspring expression color marker gene seed make selection plant convenient efficient study genome editing multiplexed selection system used generate bacterial leaf blightresistant transgenefree rice plant introduced sitespecific mutation upt box using crisprcasa technology hamper transcriptionactivatorlike effector tal protein binding gene activation generated genomeedited rice improved bacterial blight resistance transgenic pollen plant eliminated pollenspecific expression αamylase gene zmaa proportion transgenefree plant increased among single tdna insertion event generation transgenic seed visually identified discarded specific aleuronic expression dsred reduced cost led accuracy selection transgenefree edited plant demonstrated core nucleotide deletion upt box xa promoter conferred resistance rice blight selection transgenefree plant boosted introducing multiplexed selection combination genome editing transgenefree selection efficient strategy accelerate functional genomic research plant breeding,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['upt effector box promoter region rice xa gene', 'transcriptionactivatorlike effector tal protein binding gene activation']}",1
37468736,MicroRNAs Involved in Nutritional Regulation During Plant-Microbe Symbiotic and Pathogenic Interactions with Rice as a Model.,"Plants are constantly challenged with numerous adverse environmental conditions, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Coordinated regulation of plant responses requires crosstalk between regulatory pathways initiated by different external cues. Stress induced by excessiveness or deficiency of nutrients has been shown to positively or negatively interact with pathogen-induced immune responses. Also, colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can improve plant nutrition, mainly phosphorus and resistance to pathogen infection. The proposed review addresses these issues about a new question that integrates adaptation to nutrient stress and disease resistance. The main goal of the current review is to provide insights into the interconnected regulation between nutrient signaling and immune signaling pathways in rice, focusing on phosphate, potassium and iron signaling. The underpinnings of plant/pathogen/AM fungus interaction concerning rice/M. oryzae/R. irregularis is highlighted. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in Pi (miR399, miR827) and Fe (miR7695) homeostasis in pathogenic/symbiotic interactions in rice is discussed. The intracellular dynamics of membrane proteins that function in nutrient transport transgenic rice lines expressing fluorescent protein fusion genes are outlined. Integrating functional genomic, nutritional and metal content, molecular and cell biology approaches to understand how disease resistance is regulated by nutrient status leading to novel concepts in fundamental processes underlying plant disease resistance will help to devise novel strategies for crop protection with less input of pesticides and fertilizers.",plant constantly challenged numerous adverse environmental condition including biotic abiotic stress coordinated regulation plant response requires crosstalk regulatory pathway initiated different external cue stress induced excessiveness deficiency nutrient shown positively negatively interact pathogeninduced immune response also colonization arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improve plant nutrition mainly phosphorus resistance pathogen infection proposed review address issue new question integrates adaptation nutrient stress disease resistance main goal current review provide insight interconnected regulation nutrient signaling immune signaling pathway rice focusing phosphate potassium iron signaling underpinnings plantpathogenam fungus interaction concerning ricem oryzaer irregularis highlighted role micrornas mirnas involved pi mir mir fe mir homeostasis pathogenicsymbiotic interaction rice discussed intracellular dynamic membrane protein function nutrient transport transgenic rice line expressing fluorescent protein fusion gene outlined integrating functional genomic nutritional metal content molecular cell biology approach understand disease resistance regulated nutrient status leading novel concept fundamental process underlying plant disease resistance help devise novel strategy crop protection less input pesticide fertilizer,3,"{'Disease': ['nutrient stress disease resistance main goal current review', 'underpinnings plantpathogenam fungus interaction', 'understand disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
20872132,Dissecting quantitative resistance against blast disease using heterogeneous inbred family lines in rice.,"SHZ-2 is an indica rice cultivar that exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast; it is widely used as a resistance donor in breeding programs. To dissect the QTL responsible for broad-spectrum blast resistance, we crossed SHZ-2 to TXZ-13, a blast susceptible indica variety, to produce 244 BC(4)F(3) lines. These lines were evaluated for blast resistance in greenhouse and field conditions. Chromosomal introgressions from SHZ-2 into the TXZ-13 genome were identified using a single feature polymorphism microarray, SSR markers and gene-specific primers. Segregation analysis of the BC(4)F(3) population indicated that three regions on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9, designated as qBR2.1, qBR6.1, and qBR9.1, respectively, was associated with blast resistance and contributed 16.2, 14.9, and 22.3%, respectively, to the phenotypic variance of diseased leaf area (DLA). We further narrowed the three QTL regions using pairs of sister lines extracted from heterogeneous inbred families (HIF). Pairwise comparison of these lines enabled the determination of the relative contributions of individual QTL. The qBR9.1 conferred strong resistance, whereas qBR2.1 or qBR6.1 individually did not reduce disease under field conditions. However, when qBR2.1 and qBR6.1 were combined, they reduced disease by 19.5%, suggesting that small effect QTLs contribute to reduction of epidemics. The qBR6.1 and qBR9.1 regions contain nucleotide-binding sites and leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRR) sequences, whereas the qBR2.1 did not. In the qBR6.1 region, the patterns of expression of adjacent NBS-LRR genes were consistent in backcross generations and correlated with blast resistance, supporting the hypothesis that multiple resistance genes within a QTL region can contribute to non-race-specific quantitative resistance.",shz indica rice cultivar exhibit broadspectrum resistance rice blast widely used resistance donor breeding program dissect qtl responsible broadspectrum blast resistance crossed shz txz blast susceptible indica variety produce bcf line line evaluated blast resistance greenhouse field condition chromosomal introgressions shz txz genome identified using single feature polymorphism microarray ssr marker genespecific primer segregation analysis bcf population indicated three region chromosome designated qbr qbr qbr respectively associated blast resistance contributed respectively phenotypic variance diseased leaf area dla narrowed three qtl region using pair sister line extracted heterogeneous inbred family hif pairwise comparison line enabled determination relative contribution individual qtl qbr conferred strong resistance whereas qbr qbr individually reduce disease field condition however qbr qbr combined reduced disease suggesting small effect qtls contribute reduction epidemic qbr qbr region contain nucleotidebinding site leucine rich repeat nbslrr sequence whereas qbr qbr region pattern expression adjacent nbslrr gene consistent backcross generation correlated blast resistance supporting hypothesis multiple resistance gene within qtl region contribute nonracespecific quantitative resistance,0,"{'Disease': ['phenotypic variance diseased leaf area dla', 'disease field condition', 'qbr qbr combined reduced disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['small effect qtls contribute reduction epidemic qbr qbr region']}",1
32566966,Transcriptome analysis of different rice cultivars provides novel insights into the rice response to bacterial leaf streak infection.,"Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) is now the fourth-most devastating disease in rice. Dular and H359 are two indica rice varieties with contrasting responses to BLS. Dular displays high resistance, while H359 is susceptible. In this study, RNA-seq was used to examine the early molecular processes deployed during the resistance response of Dular and H359 at different times after inoculation. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis identified 3031 genes in Dular and 7161 in H359 that were modulated in response to infection after 12 and 24 h. There were significantly more DEGs in H359 than in Dular, and there were significantly more downregulated genes than upregulated genes. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed a similar set of GO terms and KEGG pathways enriched in both varieties. However, KEGG analysis of upregulated DEGs revealed that some phenylpropane metabolism-related pathways were specially enriched in Dular. Further comparison and analysis showed that the numbers of resistance-related DEGs in the two varieties were significantly reduced at 24 h compared with 12 h after BLS infection and genes critically involved in conferring resistance during the early stage mainly included WRKY transcription factors, receptor kinases and disease, exocyst, MAPK signalling pathway and hormones related genes. Our study suggests that resistance-related genes may play an important role at an early stage of infection and phenylpropane metabolism related genes may partly response for BLS resistance of Dular, thus providing valuable information for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of BLS resistance in rice.",bacterial leaf streak bls fourthmost devastating disease rice dular h two indica rice variety contrasting response bls dular display high resistance h susceptible study rnaseq used examine early molecular process deployed resistance response dular h different time inoculation differentially expressed gene deg analysis identified gene dular h modulated response infection h significantly degs h dular significantly downregulated gene upregulated gene gene ontology go kegg enrichment analysis revealed similar set go term kegg pathway enriched variety however kegg analysis upregulated degs revealed phenylpropane metabolismrelated pathway specially enriched dular comparison analysis showed number resistancerelated degs two variety significantly reduced h compared h bls infection gene critically involved conferring resistance early stage mainly included wrky transcription factor receptor kinase disease exocyst mapk signalling pathway hormone related gene study suggests resistancerelated gene may play important role early stage infection phenylpropane metabolism related gene may partly response bls resistance dular thus providing valuable information future study molecular mechanism bls resistance rice,1,"{'Disease': ['wrky transcription factor receptor kinase disease exocyst mapk'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
27454702,Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Rice Resistance Genes Against Magnaporthe oryzae Isolates from Four African Countries.,"Rice blast disease is emerging as a major constraint to rice production in Africa. Although a traditional gene-tagging strategy using biparental crosses can effectively identify resistance (R) genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) against Magnaporthe oryzae, the mapping procedure required is time consuming and requires many populations to investigate the genetics of resistance. In this report, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to rapidly map rice genes conferring resistance against eight M. oryzae isolates from four African countries. We inoculated 162 rice cultivars, which were part of the rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1) and were previously genotyped with the 44,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip, with the eight isolates. The GWAS identified 31 genomic regions associated with blast resistance (RABR) in the rice genome. In addition, we used polymerase chain reaction analysis to confirm the association between the Pish gene and a major RABR on chromosome 1 that was associated with resistance to four M. oryzae isolates. Our study has demonstrated the power of GWAS for the rapid identification of rice blast R or QTL genes that are effective against African populations of M. oryzae.

24358146,Comparative transcriptome analysis of two rice varieties in response to rice stripe virus and small brown planthoppers during early interaction.,"Rice stripe, a virus disease, transmitted by a small brown planthopper (SBPH), has greatly reduced production of japonica rice in East Asia, especially in China. Although we have made great progress in mapping resistance genes, little is known about the mechanism of resistance. By de novo transcriptome assembling, we gained sufficient transcript data to analyze changes in gene expression of early interaction in response to SBPH and RSV infection in rice. Respectively 648 and 937 DEGs were detected from the disease-resistant (Liaonong 979) and the susceptible (Fengjin) varieties, most of which were up-regulated. We found 37 genes related to insect resistance, which mainly included genes for jasmonate-induced protein, TIFY protein, lipoxygenase, as well as trypsin inhibitor genes and transcription factor genes. In the interaction process between RSV and rice, 87 genes were thought to be related to RSV resistance; these primarily included 12 peroxidase biosynthesis genes, 12 LRR receptor-like protein kinase genes, 6 genes coding pathogenesis-related proteins, 4 glycine-rich cell wall structural protein genes, 2 xyloglucan hydrolase genes and a cellulose synthase. The results indicate that the rice-pathogen interaction happened both in disease-resistant and susceptible varieties, and some genes related to JA biosynthesis played key roles in the interaction between SBPHs and rice. When rice was infected by RSV a hypersensitive reaction (HR) in the disease-resistant variety was suppressed, which resulted from an increase in peroxidase expression and down-regulation of LRR receptor-like protein kinase and pathogenesis-related proteins, while, the changes of peroxidase biosynthesis, glycine-rich cell wall structural protein, cellulose synthase and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase could lead to the strengthening of physical barriers of rice, which may be an important resistance mechanism to RSV in rice.",rice stripe virus disease transmitted small brown planthopper sbph greatly reduced production japonica rice east asia especially china although made great progress mapping resistance gene little known mechanism resistance de novo transcriptome assembling gained sufficient transcript data analyze change gene expression early interaction response sbph rsv infection rice respectively degs detected diseaseresistant liaonong susceptible fengjin variety upregulated found gene related insect resistance mainly included gene jasmonateinduced protein tify protein lipoxygenase well trypsin inhibitor gene transcription factor gene interaction process rsv rice gene thought related rsv resistance primarily included peroxidase biosynthesis gene lrr receptorlike protein kinase gene gene coding pathogenesisrelated protein glycinerich cell wall structural protein gene xyloglucan hydrolase gene cellulose synthase result indicate ricepathogen interaction happened diseaseresistant susceptible variety gene related ja biosynthesis played key role interaction sbphs rice rice infected rsv hypersensitive reaction hr diseaseresistant variety suppressed resulted increase peroxidase expression downregulation lrr receptorlike protein kinase pathogenesisrelated protein change peroxidase biosynthesis glycinerich cell wall structural protein cellulose synthase xyloglucan endotransglucosylasehydrolase could lead strengthening physical barrier rice may important resistance mechanism rsv rice,3,"{'Disease': ['rice stripe virus disease', 'degs detected diseaseresistant liaonong susceptible fengjin variety upregulated found gene related insect resistance', 'diseaseresistant susceptible variety gene', 'rsv hypersensitive reaction hr diseaseresistant variety'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
18943255,A fragment of the Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola harpin HpaG Xooc reduces disease and increases yield of rice in extensive grower plantings.,"Harpins of phytopathogenic bacteria stimulate defense and plant growth in many types of plants, conferring disease resistance and enhanced yield. In a previous study, we characterized nine fragments of the harpin protein HpaG(Xooc) from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola for plant defense elicitation and plant growth stimulation activity relative to the intact protein. In plants grown under controlled conditions, the fragment HpaG10-42 was more active in both regards than HpaG(Xooc). Here, we demonstrate that the activity of HpaG10-42 in rice under field conditions significantly exceeds that of HpaG(Xooc), stimulating resistance to three important diseases and increasing grain yield. We carried out tests in 672 experimental plots with nine cultivars of rice planted at three locations. Application protocols were optimized by testing variations in application rate, frequency, and timing with respect to rice growth stage. Of the concentrations (24, 24, 12, and 6 microg/ml), and number and timing of applications (at one to four different stages of growth) tested, HpaG10-42 at 6 microg/ml applied to plants once at nursery seedling stage and three times in the field was most effective. Bacterial blight, rice blast, and sheath blight were reduced 61.6 and 56.4, 93.6 and 76.0, and 93.2 and 55.0% in indica and japonica cultivars, respectively, relative to controls. Grain yields were 22 to 27% greater.

27897241,"Functional Involvement of a Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Module, OsMKK3-OsMPK7-OsWRK30 in Mediating Resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in Rice.","Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are highly conserved signaling modules in eukaryotes, transmitting signals from upstream receptor to downstream target by phosphorelay mechanism. Here we report involvement of a poorly characterized group C MAPK of rice namely, OsMPK7 along with its upstream MAPK kinase, OsMKK3 and downstream target, OsWRKY30 during Xanthomonas oryzae infection, a causal agent of leaf blight disease in rice. X. oryzae infection resulted in induction of OsMPK7 and OsMKK3. OsMKK3 was found to physically interact and phosphorylate OsMPK7. Overexpression of OsMPK7 and OsMKK3, individually and in combinations resulted in inhibition of disease symptoms caused by X. oryzae, however silencing of OsMPK7 resulted in disease susceptibility. Furthermore, OsWRKY30 was identified as downstream target of OsMPK7 through protein-protein interaction techniques and was found to be a positive regulator of defence response against X. oryzae pathogen. The overexpression of OsMKK3-OsMPK7 upregulated genes involved in pathogenesis, cell wall structure maintenance and cell metabolism indicating possible mechanism of disease resistance.

A novel and eco-friendly strategy to synthesise 'Fungal Chitosan' (FC) from Aspergillus niger using rice straw could serve as a sustainable treatment approach to improve both disease resistance and yields, while also effectively managing the rice stubble waste. The FC treatment promoted germination as well as growth parameters in rice varieties, TN1 (high yielding-susceptible) and PTB33 (low yielding-resistant) better than a commercial chitosan (PC). Treatments of exogenously applied FC to plants produced direct toxicity to Xoo, and reduced the BLB disease index by 39.9% in TN1. The capability of FC to trigger a cascade of defense pathways was evident from the measurable changes in the kinetics of defense enzymes, peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). FC treatment increased levels of POD in TN1 by 59.4%, which was 35.3% greater than that of untreated PTB33. Therefore, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of FC treatments for use in agriculture as a potential biostimulant as well as protective agent against bacterial leaf blight, BLB, of rice (Oryza sativa) that could be produced from stubble waste and improve rice stubble management strategies.",reduced pathogen resistance management leftover rice stubble among important challenge faced rice cultivation novel ecofriendly strategy synthesise fungal chitosan fc aspergillus niger using rice straw could serve sustainable treatment approach improve disease resistance yield also effectively managing rice stubble waste fc treatment promoted germination well growth parameter rice variety tn high yieldingsusceptible ptb low yieldingresistant better commercial chitosan pc treatment exogenously applied fc plant produced direct toxicity xoo reduced blb disease index tn capability fc trigger cascade defense pathway evident measurable change kinetics defense enzyme peroxidase pod polyphenol oxidase ppo fc treatment increased level pod tn greater untreated ptb therefore study demonstrated effectiveness fc treatment use agriculture potential biostimulant well protective agent bacterial leaf blight blb rice oryza sativa could produced stubble waste improve rice stubble management strategy,2,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance yield', 'blb disease index tn capability'], 'Treatment': ['reduced pathogen resistance management leftover rice', 'sustainable treatment approach', 'rice stubble waste fc treatment', 'well growth parameter rice variety tn high yieldingsusceptible ptb low yieldingresistant better commercial chitosan pc treatment', 'fc treatment increased level', 'demonstrated effectiveness fc treatment use', 'rice stubble management strategy'], 'Symptom': ['demonstrated effectiveness fc treatment use']}",1

Previous studies have examined the different roles of the auxin pathway during infection by biotrophic bacteria and necrotrophic fungi. We now show that the auxin signalling pathway was markedly down-regulated following infection of rice by Rice black streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV), a dsRNA virus. Repression of the auxin receptor TIR1 by a mutant overexpressing miR393 increased rice susceptibility to RBSDV. Mutants overexpressing the auxin signalling repressors OsIAA20 and OsIAA31 were also more susceptible to RBSDV. The induction of jasmonic acid (JA) pathway genes in response to RBSDV was supressed in auxin signalling mutants, suggesting that activation of the JA pathway may be part of the auxin signalling-mediated rice defence against RBSDV.

38923382,Rice stripe mosaic virus hijacks rice heading-related gene to promote the overwintering of its insect vector.,"Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV) is an emerging pathogen which significantly reduces rice yields in the southern region of China. It is transmitted by the leafhopper Recilia dorsalis, which overwinters in rice fields. Our field investigations revealed that RSMV infection causes delayed rice heading, resulting in a large number of green diseased plants remaining in winter rice fields. This creates a favorable environment for leafhoppers and viruses to overwinter, potentially contributing to the rapid spread and epidemic of the disease. Next, we explored the mechanism by which RSMV manipulates the developmental processes of the rice plant.

38153818,GERWR: Identifying the Key Pathogenicity- Associated sRNAs of Magnaporthe Oryzae Infection in Rice Based on Graph Embedding and Random Walk With Restart.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae(M.oryzae), is a destructive rice disease that reduces rice yield by 10% to 30% annually. It also affects other cereal crops such as barley, wheat, rye, millet, sorghum, and maize. Small RNAs (sRNAs) play an essential regulatory role in fungus-plant interaction during the fungal invasion, but studies on pathogenic sRNAs during the fungal invasion of plants based on multi-omics data integration are rare. This paper proposes a novel approach called Graph Embedding combined with Random Walk with Restart (GERWR) to identify pathogenic sRNAs based on multi-omics data integration during M.oryzae invasion. By constructing a multi-omics network (MRMO), we identified 29 pathogenic sRNAs of rice blast fungus. Further analysis revealed that these sRNAs regulate rice genes in a many-to-many relationship, playing a significant regulatory role in the pathogenesis of rice blast disease. This paper explores the pathogenic factors of rice blast disease from the perspective of multi-omics data analysis, revealing the inherent connection between pathogenic factors of different omics. It has essential scientific significance for studying the pathogenic mechanism of rice blast fungus, the rice blast fungus-rice model system, and the pathogen-host interaction in related fields.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzaemoryzae destructive rice disease reduces rice yield annually also affect cereal crop barley wheat rye millet sorghum maize small rna srnas play essential regulatory role fungusplant interaction fungal invasion study pathogenic srnas fungal invasion plant based multiomics data integration rare paper proposes novel approach called graph embedding combined random walk restart gerwr identify pathogenic srnas based multiomics data integration moryzae invasion constructing multiomics network mrmo identified pathogenic srnas rice blast fungus analysis revealed srnas regulate rice gene manytomany relationship playing significant regulatory role pathogenesis rice blast disease paper explores pathogenic factor rice blast disease perspective multiomics data analysis revealing inherent connection pathogenic factor different omics essential scientific significance studying pathogenic mechanism rice blast fungus rice blast fungusrice model system pathogenhost interaction related field,1,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzaemoryzae destructive rice disease', 'pathogenic srnas rice blast fungus analysis', 'pathogenesis rice blast disease paper', 'pathogenic factor rice blast disease perspective multiomics data analysis', 'pathogenic mechanism rice blast fungus rice blast fungusrice model system pathogenhost interaction related field'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3

Since the usage of chemical control methods has not been very promising for the future disease management, it is of high importance to systematically gain new insights about Xoo virulence and pathogenesis, and devise effective strategies to combat the rice disease. To do this, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of Xoo (iXOO673) and validated the model predictions using culture experiments. Comparison of the metabolic architecture of Xoo and other plant pathogens indicated that the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is a more common feature in these bacteria than previously thought, while suggesting some of the unique virulence mechanisms related to Xoo metabolism. Subsequent constraint-based flux analysis allowed us to show that Xoo modulates fluxes through gluconeogenesis, glycogen biosynthesis, and degradation pathways, thereby exacerbating the leaf blight in rice exposed to nitrogenous fertilizers, which is remarkably consistent with published experimental literature. Moreover, model-based interrogation of transcriptomic data revealed the metabolic components under the diffusible signal factor regulon that are crucial for virulence and survival in Xoo. Finally, we identified promising antibacterial targets for the control of leaf blight in rice by using gene essentiality analysis.",xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo vascular pathogen cause leaf blight rice leading severe yield loss since usage chemical control method promising future disease management high importance systematically gain new insight xoo virulence pathogenesis devise effective strategy combat rice disease reconstructed genomescale metabolic model xoo ixoo validated model prediction using culture experiment comparison metabolic architecture xoo plant pathogen indicated entnerdoudoroff pathway common feature bacteria previously thought suggesting unique virulence mechanism related xoo metabolism subsequent constraintbased flux analysis allowed u show xoo modulates flux gluconeogenesis glycogen biosynthesis degradation pathway thereby exacerbating leaf blight rice exposed nitrogenous fertilizer remarkably consistent published experimental literature moreover modelbased interrogation transcriptomic data revealed metabolic component diffusible signal factor regulon crucial virulence survival xoo finally identified promising antibacterial target control leaf blight rice using gene essentiality analysis,2,"{'Disease': ['future disease management high importance', 'effective strategy combat rice disease'], 'Treatment': ['usage chemical control method', 'future disease management high importance'], 'Symptom': ['effective strategy combat rice disease']}",4
39025063,A pair of E3 ubiquitin ligases control immunity and flowering by targeting different ELF3 proteins in rice.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays crucial roles in cellular processes including plant growth, development, and stress responses. In this study, we report that a pair of E3 ubiquitin ligases, AvrPiz-t-interaction protein 6 (APIP6) and IPA1-interaction protein 1 (IPI1), intricately target early flowering3 (ELF3) paralogous proteins to control rice immunity and flowering. APIP6 forms homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers with IPI1. Both proteins interact with OsELF3-2, promoting its degradation to positively control resistance against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae). Intriguingly, overexpression of IPI1 in Nipponbare caused significantly late-flowering phenotypes similar to the oself3-1 mutant. Except for late flowering, oself3-1 enhances resistance against M. oryzae. IPI1 also interacts with and promotes the degradation of OsELF3-1, a paralog of OsELF3-2. Notably, IPI1 and APIP6 synergistically modulate OsELF3s degradation, finely tuning blast disease resistance by targeting OsELF3-2, while IPI1 controls both disease resistance and flowering by targeting OsELF3-1.

24505015,Comparative proteomic analysis of methyl jasmonate-induced defense responses in different rice cultivars.,"Jasmonate is an important endogenous chemical signal that plays a role in modulation of plant defense responses. To understand its mechanisms in regulation of rice resistance against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, comparative phenotype and proteomic analyses were undertaken using two near-isogenic cultivars with different levels of disease resistance. Methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) treatment significantly enhanced the resistance against M. oryzae in both cultivars but the treated resistant cultivar maintained a higher level of resistance than the same treated susceptible cultivars. Proteomic analysis revealed 26 and 16 MeJA-modulated proteins in resistant and susceptible cultivars, respectively, and both cultivars shared a common set of 13 proteins. Cumulatively, a total of 29 unique MeJA-influenced proteins were identified with many of them known to be associated with plant defense response and ROS accumulation. Consistent with the findings of proteomic analysis, MeJA treatment increased ROS accumulation in both cultivars with the resistant cultivar showing higher levels of ROS production and cell membrane damage than the susceptible cultivar. Taken together, our data add a new insight into the mechanisms of overall MeJA-induced rice defense response and provide a molecular basis of using MeJA to enhance fungal disease resistance in resistant and susceptible rice cultivars.",jasmonate important endogenous chemical signal play role modulation plant defense response understand mechanism regulation rice resistance fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae comparative phenotype proteomic analysis undertaken using two nearisogenic cultivar different level disease resistance methyljasmonate meja treatment significantly enhanced resistance oryzae cultivar treated resistant cultivar maintained higher level resistance treated susceptible cultivar proteomic analysis revealed mejamodulated protein resistant susceptible cultivar respectively cultivar shared common set protein cumulatively total unique mejainfluenced protein identified many known associated plant defense response ro accumulation consistent finding proteomic analysis meja treatment increased ro accumulation cultivar resistant cultivar showing higher level ro production cell membrane damage susceptible cultivar taken together data add new insight mechanism overall mejainduced rice defense response provide molecular basis using meja enhance fungal disease resistance resistant susceptible rice cultivar,2,"{'Disease': ['two nearisogenic cultivar different level disease resistance methyljasmonate meja treatment', 'meja enhance fungal disease resistance resistant susceptible rice cultivar'], 'Treatment': ['two nearisogenic cultivar different level disease resistance methyljasmonate meja treatment', 'meja treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",0

To investigate the molecular mechanism of probenazole-induced resistance, we isolated and characterized a cDNA clone of a probenazole-inducible gene in rice, which encoded a protein designated PBZ1. Sequence analysis revealed that significant homology at the amino acid level exists between the predicted PBZ1 protein and intracellular pathogenesis-related (IPR) proteins. Accumulation of PBZ1 mRNA was not induced by wounding, but markedly induced by inoculation with rice blast fungus. In addition, it was induced sooner by inoculation with an incompatible race than that with a compatible race. On the other hand, when the accumulation of the PBZ1 mRNA was examined after treatment with probenazole-related compounds, it was not fully correlated with anti-rice blast activity. However, it was induced after treatment with N-cyano-methyl-2-chloro-isonicotinamide (NCI), which belongs to another group of compounds known to induce disease resistance. Thus, although the accumulation of the PBZ1 mRNA was not fully correlated with anti-rice blast activity, our findings suggest that the PBZ1 gene has an important function during the disease resistance response in rice.",probenazole allyloxybenzisothiazoledioxide induces disease resistance rice rice blast fungus investigate molecular mechanism probenazoleinduced resistance isolated characterized cdna clone probenazoleinducible gene rice encoded protein designated pbz sequence analysis revealed significant homology amino acid level exists predicted pbz protein intracellular pathogenesisrelated ipr protein accumulation pbz mrna induced wounding markedly induced inoculation rice blast fungus addition induced sooner inoculation incompatible race compatible race hand accumulation pbz mrna examined treatment probenazolerelated compound fully correlated antirice blast activity however induced treatment ncyanomethylchloroisonicotinamide nci belongs another group compound known induce disease resistance thus although accumulation pbz mrna fully correlated antirice blast activity finding suggest pbz gene important function disease resistance response rice,1,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance rice rice blast fungus', 'inoculation rice blast fungus addition', 'another group compound known induce disease resistance', 'pbz gene important function disease resistance response rice'], 'Treatment': ['sooner inoculation incompatible race compatible race hand accumulation pbz mrna examined treatment probenazolerelated compound fully correlated antirice blast activity', 'treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",3
19390838,Dissection of the factors affecting development-controlled and race-specific disease resistance conferred by leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase-type R genes in rice.,"Development-controlled resistance and resistance specificity frequently restrict the application of a disease resistance (R) gene in crop breeding programs. Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21, encoding leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-kinase type plasma membrane proteins, mediate race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases. Plants carrying Xa3/Xa26 and plants carrying Xa21 have different resistance spectra and the functions of the two R genes are regulated by developmental stage. Four chimeric genes encoding proteins consisting of different parts of XA3/XA26 and XA21 were constructed by domain swapping and transformed into a susceptible rice variety. The resistance spectra and development-regulated resistance of the transgenic plants carrying Xa3/Xa26, Xa21, or chimeric gene to different Xoo strains were analyzed in the same genetic background. The results suggest that the gradually increased expression of Xa3/Xa26 and Xa21 plays an important role in the progressively enhanced Xoo resistance during rice development. In addition, the LRR domains of XA3/XA26 and XA21 are important determinants of race-specific recognition during rice-Xoo interaction, but juxtamembrane regions of the two R proteins also appear to contribute to resistance specificity.",developmentcontrolled resistance resistance specificity frequently restrict application disease resistance r gene crop breeding program xaxa xa encoding leucinerich repeat lrrkinase type plasma membrane protein mediate racespecific resistance xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo cause bacterial blight one devastating rice disease plant carrying xaxa plant carrying xa different resistance spectrum function two r gene regulated developmental stage four chimeric gene encoding protein consisting different part xaxa xa constructed domain swapping transformed susceptible rice variety resistance spectrum developmentregulated resistance transgenic plant carrying xaxa xa chimeric gene different xoo strain analyzed genetic background result suggest gradually increased expression xaxa xa play important role progressively enhanced xoo resistance rice development addition lrr domain xaxa xa important determinant racespecific recognition ricexoo interaction juxtamembrane region two r protein also appear contribute resistance specificity,4,"{'Disease': ['application disease resistance r gene crop breeding program xaxa xa encoding leucinerich repeat lrrkinase type plasma membrane protein mediate racespecific resistance xanthomonas'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
38769168,Genome-wide association analysis uncovers rice blast resistance alleles of Ptr and Pia.,"A critical step to maximize the usefulness of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in plant breeding is the identification and validation of candidate genes underlying genetic associations. This is of particular importance in disease resistance breeding where allelic variants of resistance genes often confer resistance to distinct populations, or races, of a pathogen. Here, we perform a genome-wide association analysis of rice blast resistance in 500 genetically diverse rice accessions. To facilitate candidate gene identification, we produce de-novo genome assemblies of ten rice accessions with various rice blast resistance associations. These genome assemblies facilitate the identification and functional validation of novel alleles of the rice blast resistance genes Ptr and Pia. We uncover an allelic series for the unusual Ptr rice blast resistance gene, and additional alleles of the Pia resistance genes RGA4 and RGA5. By linking these associations to three thousand rice genomes we provide a useful tool to inform future rice blast breeding efforts.

26112675,A comprehensive quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of rice in response to bacterial blight.,"Rice is a major crop worldwide. Bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) has become one of the most devastating diseases for rice. It has been clear that phosphorylation plays essential roles in plant disease resistance. However, the role of phosphorylation is poorly understood in rice-Xoo system. Here, we report the first study on large scale enrichment of phosphopeptides and identification of phosphosites in rice before and 24 h after Xoo infection. We have successfully identified 2367 and 2223 phosphosites on 1334 and 1297 representative proteins in 0 h and 24 h after Xoo infection, respectively. A total of 762 differentially phosphorylated proteins, including transcription factors, kinases, epi-genetic controlling factors and many well-known disease resistant proteins, are identified after Xoo infection suggesting that they may be functionally relevant to Xoo resistance. In particular, we found that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation might be a key switch turning on/off many epi-genetic controlling factors, including HDT701, in response to Xoo infection, suggesting that phosphorylation switch overriding the epi-genetic regulation may be a very universal model in the plant disease resistance pathway. The phosphosites identified in this study would be a big complementation to our current knowledge in the phosphorylation status and sites of rice proteins.

In this study, we found a portion of the known resistance gene <i>Ptr</i> encoding a protein with four armadillo repeats and confers a broad spectrum of blast resistance. We then analyzed the sequences of the <i>Ptr</i> gene from weedy rice, <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i>, and identified a unique amino acid glutamine at protein position 874. Minor changes of protein conformation of the <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i> gene were predicted through structural analysis of <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i>, suggesting that the product of <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i> is involved in disease resistance. A gene-specific codominant marker HJ17-13 from <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i> was then developed to distinguish alleles in weeds and crops.

28755027,Genetic Structure of the Rice Blast Pathogen (Magnaporthe oryzae) over a Decade in North Central California Rice Fields.,"Rice blast, caused by the ascomycete Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide. Even though the disease has been present in California since 1996, there is no data for the pathogen population biology in the state. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms and mating-type markers, the M. oryzae population diversity was investigated using isolates collected when the disease was first established in California and isolates collected a decade later. While in the 1990 samples, a single multilocus genotype (MLG) was identified (MLG1), over a decade later, we found 14 additional MLGs in the 2000 isolates. Some of these MLGs were found to infect the only rice blast-resistant cultivar (M-208) available for commercial production in California. The same samples also had a significant decrease of MLG1. MLG1 was found infecting the resistant rice cultivar M-208 on one occasion whereas MLG7 was the most common genotype infecting the M-208. MLG7 was identified in the 2000 samples, and it was not present in the M. oryzae population a decade earlier. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in genotypic diversity over time with no evidence of sexual reproduction and suggest a recent introduction of new virulent race(s) of the pathogen.

To better understand the rice-C. miyabeanus interaction, we employed proteomic approaches to establish differential proteomes of total and secreted proteins from the inoculated leaves. The 2DE approach after PEG-fractionation of total proteins coupled with MS (MALDI-TOF/TOF and nESI-LC-MS/MS) analyses led to identification of 49 unique proteins out of 63 differential spots. SDS-PAGE in combination with nESI-LC-MS/MS shotgun approach was applied to identify secreted proteins in the leaf apoplast upon infection and resulted in cataloging of 501 unique proteins, of which 470 and 31 proteins were secreted from rice and C. miyabeanus, respectively. Proteins mapped onto metabolic pathways implied their reprogramming upon infection. The enzymes involved in Calvin cycle and glycolysis decreased in their protein abundance, whereas enzymes in the TCA cycle, amino acids, and ethylene biosynthesis increased. Differential proteomes also generated distribution of identified proteins in the intracellular and extracellular spaces, providing a better insight into defense responses of proteins in rice against C. miyabeanus.

In this study, we identified a chaperone DnaJ protein, OsDjA6, which is involved in basal resistance to M. oryzae in rice. The OsDjA6 protein is distributed in the entire rice cell. The expression of OsDjA6 is significantly induced in rice after infection with a compatible isolate. Silencing of OsDjA6 in transgenic rice enhances resistance to M. oryzae and also results in an increased burst of reactive oxygen species after flg22 and chitin treatments. In addition, the expression levels of WRKY45, NPR1 and PR5 are increased in OsDjA6 RNAi plants, indicating that OsDjA6 may mediate resistance by affecting the salicylic acid pathway.

38747865,Selection of rice breeding lines for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown in many countries around the world with different climatic conditions and a huge number of environmental stresses, both biotic (fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects) and abiotic (cold, drought, salinity) limit rice productivity. In this regard, breeders and scientists are trying to create rice lines that are resistant to multiple stresses. The aim of this work was to screen and select cold and blast resistant rice breeding lines (RBLs) using molecular markers. Molecular screening of RBLs and parental varieties to cold tolerance was carried out using markers RM24545, RM1377, RM231 and RM569 associated with QTLs (qPSST-3, qPSST-7, qPSST-9). It was discovered that the presence of three QTLs characterizes the cold resistance of studied genotypes, and the absence of one of them leads to cold sensitivity. As a result, 21 cold-resistant out of the 28 studied RBLs were identified.

26674380,Dynamic and Coordinated Expression Changes of Rice Small RNAs in Response to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"Endogenous small RNAs are newly identified players in plant immune responses, yet their roles in rice (Oryza sativa) responding to pathogens are still less understood, especially for pathogens that can cause severe yield losses. We examined the small RNA expression profiles of rice leaves at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours post infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) virulent strain PXO99, the causal agent of rice bacterial blight disease. Dynamic expression changes of some miRNAs and trans-acting siRNAs were identified, together with a few novel miRNA targets, including an RLK gene targeted by osa-miR159a.1. Coordinated expression changes were observed among some small RNAs in response to Xoo infection, with small RNAs exhibiting the same expression pattern tended to regulate genes in the same or related signaling pathways, including auxin and GA signaling pathways, nutrition and defense-related pathways.

26237696,Microscopic Aspects of Silicon-Mediated Rice Resistance to Leaf Scald.,"This study investigated the effect of silicon (Si) on the potentiation of rice resistance against leaf scald at the microscopic level. Rice plants ('Primavera') were grown in a nutrient solution containing 0 (-Si) or 2 mM (+Si) Si. The foliar Si concentration of the +Si plants (3.6 dag/kg) increased in comparison with the -Si plants (0.3 dag/kg). An X-ray microanalysis revealed that the leaf tissue of +Si plants infected with Microdochium oryzae had higher peaks and deposition of insoluble Si than that of -Si plants. The high foliar Si concentration for the +Si plants reduced the expansion of leaf scald lesions. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that fungal hyphae and appressorium-like structures of M. oryzae were more abundant in the leaf surface of -Si plants relative to +Si plants. At both histopathological and ultrastructural levels, fungal hyphae grew abundantly into the leaf tissue of -Si plants. By contrast, rice cell walls were rarely degraded and fungal hyphae were often surrounded by amorphous granular material in the leaf tissue of +Si plants. Conidiophores emerged from stomata 36 h after fungal penetration, and conidia were noticed inside the leaf tissue of the -Si plants in great abundance. The collective results of the present study showed a high concentration and deposition of Si and a considerable deposition of phenolic-like compounds in the leaf tissue of +Si plants. These results indicate that the potentiation of the phenylpropanoid pathway in these plants supplied with Si was favorable for the increase in rice resistance to leaf scald.",study investigated effect silicon si potentiation rice resistance leaf scald microscopic level rice plant primavera grown nutrient solution containing si mm si si foliar si concentration si plant dagkg increased comparison si plant dagkg xray microanalysis revealed leaf tissue si plant infected microdochium oryzae higher peak deposition insoluble si si plant high foliar si concentration si plant reduced expansion leaf scald lesion scanning electron microscopy revealed fungal hypha appressoriumlike structure oryzae abundant leaf surface si plant relative si plant histopathological ultrastructural level fungal hypha grew abundantly leaf tissue si plant contrast rice cell wall rarely degraded fungal hypha often surrounded amorphous granular material leaf tissue si plant conidiophore emerged stoma h fungal penetration conidium noticed inside leaf tissue si plant great abundance collective result present study showed high concentration deposition si considerable deposition phenoliclike compound leaf tissue si plant result indicate potentiation phenylpropanoid pathway plant supplied si favorable increase rice resistance leaf scald,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect silicon si potentiation rice resistance leaf scald microscopic level rice plant primavera']}",4
30606471,Identification and characterization of rice blast resistance gene Pid4 by a combination of transcriptomic profiling and genome analysis.,"Map-based cloning of plant disease resistance (R) genes is time-consuming. Here, we reported the isolation of blast R gene Pid4 using comparative transcriptomic profiling and genome-wide sequence analysis. Pid4 encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein and is constitutively expressed at diverse developmental stages in the rice variety Digu. The Pid4 protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Introduction of Pid4 into susceptible rice cultivars confers race-specific resistance to leaf and neck blast. Amino acid sequence comparison and blast resistance spectrum tests showed that Pid4 is a novel R gene, different from the previously reported R genes located in the same gene cluster. A Pid4 Indel marker was developed to facilitate the identification of Pid4 in different rice varieties. We demonstrated that a plant R gene can be quickly isolated using transcriptomic profiling coupled with genome-wide sequence analysis.",mapbased cloning plant disease resistance r gene timeconsuming reported isolation blast r gene pid using comparative transcriptomic profiling genomewide sequence analysis pid encodes coiledcoil nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat ccnbslrr protein constitutively expressed diverse developmental stage rice variety digu pid protein localized nucleus cytoplasm introduction pid susceptible rice cultivar confers racespecific resistance leaf neck blast amino acid sequence comparison blast resistance spectrum test showed pid novel r gene different previously reported r gene located gene cluster pid indel marker developed facilitate identification pid different rice variety demonstrated plant r gene quickly isolated using transcriptomic profiling coupled genomewide sequence analysis,1,"{'Disease': ['mapbased cloning plant disease resistance r gene timeconsuming'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3

15986920,Overexpression of a rice NPR1 homolog leads to constitutive activation of defense response and hypersensitivity to light.,"Arabidopsis NPR1/NIM1 is a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which confers lasting broad-spectrum resistance. Previous reports indicate that rice has a disease-resistance pathway similar to the Arabidopsis SAR pathway. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a rice NPR1 homologue (NH1). Transgenic rice plants overexpressing NH1 (NH1ox) acquire high levels of resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The resistance phenotype is heritable and correlates with the presence of the transgene and reduced bacterial growth. Northern analysis shows that NH1ox rice spontaneously activates defense genes, contrasting with NPR1-overexpressing Arabidopsis, where defense genes are not activated until induction. Wild-type NH1, but not a point mutant corresponding to npr1-1, interacts strongly with the rice transcription factor rTGA2.2 in yeast two-hybrid. Greenhouse-grown NH1ox plants develop lesion-mimic spots on leaves at preflowering stage although no other developmental effects are observed. However, when grown in growth chambers (GCs) under low light, NH1ox plants are dwarfed, indicating elevated sensitivity to light. The GC-grown NH1ox plants show much higher salicylic acid (SA) levels than the wild type, whereas greenhouse-grown NH1ox plants contain lower SA. These results indicate that NH1 may be involved in the regulation of SA in response to environmental changes.",arabidopsis nprnim key regulator systemic acquired resistance sar confers lasting broadspectrum resistance previous report indicate rice diseaseresistance pathway similar arabidopsis sar pathway report isolation characterization rice npr homologue nh transgenic rice plant overexpressing nh nhox acquire high level resistance xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae resistance phenotype heritable correlate presence transgene reduced bacterial growth northern analysis show nhox rice spontaneously activates defense gene contrasting nproverexpressing arabidopsis defense gene activated induction wildtype nh point mutant corresponding npr interacts strongly rice transcription factor rtga yeast twohybrid greenhousegrown nhox plant develop lesionmimic spot leaf preflowering stage although developmental effect observed however grown growth chamber gc low light nhox plant dwarfed indicating elevated sensitivity light gcgrown nhox plant show much higher salicylic acid sa level wild type whereas greenhousegrown nhox plant contain lower sa result indicate nh may involved regulation sa response environmental change,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['developmental effect']}",4
38587024,The clade III subfamily of OsSWEETs directly suppresses rice immunity by interacting with OsHMGB1 and OsHsp20L.,"The clade III subfamily of OsSWEETs includes transmembrane proteins necessary for susceptibility to bacterial blight (BB). These genes are targeted by the specific transcription activator-like effector (TALE) of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and mediate sucrose efflux for bacterial proliferation. However, the mechanism through which OsSWEETs regulate rice immunity has not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that the cytosolic carboxyl terminus of OsSWEET11a/Xa13 is required for complementing susceptibility to PXO99 in IRBB13 (xa13/xa13). Interestingly, the C-terminus of ZmXa13, the maize homologue of OsSWEET11a/Xa13, could perfectly substitute for the C-terminus of OsSWEET11a/Xa13. Furthermore, OsSWEET11a/Xa13 interacted with the high-mobility group B1 (OsHMGB1) protein and the small heat shock-like protein OsHsp20L through the same regions in the C-terminus. Consistent with the physical interactions, knockdown or knockout of either OsHMGB1 or OsHsp20L caused an enhanced PXO99-resistant phenotype similar to that of OsSWEET11a/OsXa13. Surprisingly, the plants in which OsHMGB1 or OsHsp20L was repressed developed increased resistance to PXO86, PXO61 and YN24, which carry TALEs targeting OsSWEET14/Xa41 or OsSWEET11a/Xa13. Additionally, OsHsp20L can interact with all six members of clade III OsSWEETs, whereas OsHMGB1 can interact with five other members in addition to OsSWEET12. Overall, we revealed that OsHMGB1 and OsHsp20L mediate conserved BB susceptibility by interacting with clade III OsSWEETs, which are candidates for breeding broad-spectrum disease-resistant rice.",clade iii subfamily ossweets includes transmembrane protein necessary susceptibility bacterial blight bb gene targeted specific transcription activatorlike effector tale xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae mediate sucrose efflux bacterial proliferation however mechanism ossweets regulate rice immunity fully elucidated demonstrated cytosolic carboxyl terminus ossweetaxa required complementing susceptibility pxo irbb xaxa interestingly cterminus zmxa maize homologue ossweetaxa could perfectly substitute cterminus ossweetaxa furthermore ossweetaxa interacted highmobility group b oshmgb protein small heat shocklike protein oshspl region cterminus consistent physical interaction knockdown knockout either oshmgb oshspl caused enhanced pxoresistant phenotype similar ossweetaosxa surprisingly plant oshmgb oshspl repressed developed increased resistance pxo pxo yn carry tale targeting ossweetxa ossweetaxa additionally oshspl interact six member clade iii ossweets whereas oshmgb interact five member addition ossweet overall revealed oshmgb oshspl mediate conserved bb susceptibility interacting clade iii ossweets candidate breeding broadspectrum diseaseresistant rice,4,"{'Disease': ['clade iii ossweets candidate breeding broadspectrum diseaseresistant rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector tale']}",2

19793907,Selective modification of rice (Oryza sativa) gene expression by rice stripe virus infection.,"Rice stripe disease, caused by rice stripe virus (RSV), is one of the major virus diseases in east Asia. Rice plants infected with RSV usually show symptoms such as chlorosis, weakness, necrosis in newly emerged leaves and stunting. To reveal rice cellular systems influenced by RSV infection, temporal changes in the transcriptome of RSV-infected plants were monitored by a customized rice oligoarray system. The transcriptome changes in RSV-infected plants indicated that protein-synthesis machineries and energy production in the mitochondrion were activated by RSV infection, whereas energy production in the chloroplast and synthesis of cell-structure components were suppressed. The transcription of genes related to host-defence systems under hormone signals and those for gene silencing were not activated at the early infection phase. Together with concurrent observation of virus concentration and symptom development, such transcriptome changes in RSV-infected plants suggest that different sets of various host genes are regulated depending on the development of disease symptoms and the accumulation of RSV.",rice stripe disease caused rice stripe virus rsv one major virus disease east asia rice plant infected rsv usually show symptom chlorosis weakness necrosis newly emerged leaf stunting reveal rice cellular system influenced rsv infection temporal change transcriptome rsvinfected plant monitored customized rice oligoarray system transcriptome change rsvinfected plant indicated proteinsynthesis machinery energy production mitochondrion activated rsv infection whereas energy production chloroplast synthesis cellstructure component suppressed transcription gene related hostdefence system hormone signal gene silencing activated early infection phase together concurrent observation virus concentration symptom development transcriptome change rsvinfected plant suggest different set various host gene regulated depending development disease symptom accumulation rsv,3,"{'Disease': ['rice stripe disease', 'rice stripe virus', 'one major virus disease east asia rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['symptom chlorosis weakness necrosis', 'concentration symptom development']}",2
24093634,Genome-wide identification of WRKY45-regulated genes that mediate benzothiadiazole-induced defense responses in rice.,"The rice transcription factor WRKY45 plays a crucial role in salicylic acid (SA)/benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced disease resistance. Its knockdown severely reduces BTH-induced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Conversely, overexpression of WRKY45 induces extremely strong resistance to both of these pathogens. To elucidate the molecular basis of WRKY45-dependent disease resistance, we analyzed WRKY45-regulated gene expression using rice transformants and a transient gene expression system. We conducted a microarray analysis using WRKY45-knockdown (WRKY45-kd) rice plants, and identified WRKY45-dependent genes among the BTH-responsive genes. The BTH-responsiveness of 260 genes was dependent on WRKY45. Among these, 220 genes (85%), many of which encoded PR proteins and proteins associated with secondary metabolism, were upregulated by BTH. Only a small portion of these genes overlapped with those regulated by OsNPR1/NH1, supporting the idea that the rice SA pathway branches into WRKY45- regulated and OsNPR1/NH1-regulated subpathways. Dexamethazone-induced expression of myc-tagged WRKY45 in rice immediately upregulated transcription of endogenous WRKY45 and genes encoding the transcription factors WRKY62, OsNAC4, and HSF1, all of which have been reported to have defense-related functions. This was followed by upregulation of defense genes encoding PR proteins and secondary metabolic enzymes. Many of these genes were also induced after M. oryzae infection. Their temporal transcription patterns were consistent with those after dexamethazone-induced WRKY45 expression. In a transient expression system consisting of particle bombardment of rice coleoptiles, WRKY45 acted as an effector to trans-activate reporter genes in which the luciferase coding sequence was fused to upstream and intragenic sequences of WRKY62 and OsNAC4. Trans-activation of transcription occurred through a W-box-containing sequence upstream of OsNAC4 and mutations in the W-boxes abolished the trans-activation. These data suggest a role of WRKY45 in BTH-induced disease resistance as a master regulator of the transcriptional cascade regulating defense responses in one of two branches in the rice SA pathway.",rice transcription factor wrky play crucial role salicylic acid sabenzothiadiazole bthinduced disease resistance knockdown severely reduces bthinduced resistance fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo conversely overexpression wrky induces extremely strong resistance pathogen elucidate molecular basis wrkydependent disease resistance analyzed wrkyregulated gene expression using rice transformants transient gene expression system conducted microarray analysis using wrkyknockdown wrkykd rice plant identified wrkydependent gene among bthresponsive gene bthresponsiveness gene dependent wrky among gene many encoded pr protein protein associated secondary metabolism upregulated bth small portion gene overlapped regulated osnprnh supporting idea rice sa pathway branch wrky regulated osnprnhregulated subpathways dexamethazoneinduced expression myctagged wrky rice immediately upregulated transcription endogenous wrky gene encoding transcription factor wrky osnac hsf reported defenserelated function followed upregulation defense gene encoding pr protein secondary metabolic enzyme many gene also induced oryzae infection temporal transcription pattern consistent dexamethazoneinduced wrky expression transient expression system consisting particle bombardment rice coleoptiles wrky acted effector transactivate reporter gene luciferase coding sequence fused upstream intragenic sequence wrky osnac transactivation transcription occurred wboxcontaining sequence upstream osnac mutation wboxes abolished transactivation data suggest role wrky bthinduced disease resistance master regulator transcriptional cascade regulating defense response one two branch rice sa pathway,2,"{'Disease': ['crucial role salicylic acid sabenzothiadiazole bthinduced disease resistance knockdown', 'elucidate molecular basis wrkydependent disease resistance', 'role wrky bthinduced disease resistance master regulator transcriptional cascade regulating defense response'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector transactivate reporter gene']}",1
33993401,Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Rice Resistant and Susceptible Genotypes to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Identifies Novel Genes to Control Bacterial Leaf Blight.,"The bacterial leaf blight in rice caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) affects crop losses worldwide. In spite of developing resistant varieties by introgressing different Xa genes, the occurrence of diseases is evident.

Xoo-resistant rice genotype BPT-5204 with Xa 5, 13 and 21 genes is compared with sensitive Taichung Native 1 (TN-1) to identify the genetic pathways and gene networks involved in resistance mechanisms. The higher levels of salicylic acid resulted in upregulation of many pathogenesis-related (PR) and redox protein encoding transcripts which resulted in higher hypersensitive response in BPT-5204.

38863209,A KNOX Ⅱ transcription factor suppresses the NLR immune receptor BRG8-mediated immunity in rice.,"Nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are activated by detecting pathogen effectors, which in turn trigger host defenses and cell death. Although many NLRs have been identified, the mechanisms responsible for NLR-triggered defense responses are still poorly understood. In this study, through a genome-wide association study approach, we identified a novel NLR gene, Blast Resistance Gene 8 (BRG8), which confers resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight diseases. BRG8 overexpression and complementation lines exhibit enhanced resistance to both pathogens. Subcellular localization assays showed that BRG8 is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Additional evidence revealed that nuclear-localized BRG8 can enhance rice immunity without a hypersensitive response (HR)-like phenotype. We also demonstrated that the coiled-coil domain of BRG8 not only physically interacts with itself but also interacts with the KNOX Ⅱ protein HOMEOBOX ORYZA SATIVA59 (HOS59). Knockout mutants of HOS59 in the BRG8 background show enhanced resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae strain CH171 and Xoo strain CR4, similar to that of the BRG8 background. By contrast, overexpression of HOS59 in the BRG8 background will compromise the HR-like phenotype and resistance response. Further analysis revealed that HOS59 promotes the degradation of BRG8 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Collectively, our study highlights HOS59 as an NLR immune regulator that fine-tunes BRG8-mediated immune responses against pathogens, providing new insights into NLR associations and functions in plant immunity.",nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat nlr protein activated detecting pathogen effector turn trigger host defense cell death although many nlrs identified mechanism responsible nlrtriggered defense response still poorly understood study genomewide association study approach identified novel nlr gene blast resistance gene brg confers resistance rice blast bacterial blight disease brg overexpression complementation line exhibit enhanced resistance pathogen subcellular localization assay showed brg localized cytoplasm nucleus additional evidence revealed nuclearlocalized brg enhance rice immunity without hypersensitive response hrlike phenotype also demonstrated coiledcoil domain brg physically interacts also interacts knox ⅱ protein homeobox oryza sativa ho knockout mutant ho brg background show enhanced resistance magnaporthe oryzae strain ch xoo strain cr similar brg background contrast overexpression ho brg background compromise hrlike phenotype resistance response analysis revealed ho promotes degradation brg via proteasome pathway collectively study highlight ho nlr immune regulator finetunes brgmediated immune response pathogen providing new insight nlr association function plant immunity,4,"{'Disease': ['resistance rice blast bacterial blight disease brg overexpression complementation line'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['detecting pathogen effector']}",3
22442415,The rice ERF transcription factor OsERF922 negatively regulates resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and salt tolerance.,"Rice OsERF922, encoding an APETELA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) type transcription factor, is rapidly and strongly induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and salt treatments, as well as by both virulent and avirulent pathovars of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. OsERF922 is localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the GCC box sequence, and acts as a transcriptional activator in plant cells. Knockdown of OsERF922 by means of RNAi enhanced resistance against M. oryzae. The elevated disease resistance of the RNAi plants was associated with increased expression of PR, PAL, and the other genes encoding phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes and without M. oryzae infection. In contrast, OsERF922-overexpressing plants showed reduced expression of these defence-related genes and enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae. In addition, the OsERF922-overexpressing lines exhibited decreased tolerance to salt stress with an increased Na(+)/K(+) ratio in the shoots. The ABA levels were found increased in the overexpressing lines and decreased in the RNAi plants. Expression of the ABA biosynthesis-related genes, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) 3 and 4, was upregulated in the OsERF922-overexpressing plants, and NCED4 was downregulated in the RNAi lines.

39294226,Target prediction of potential candidate miRNAs from Oryza sativa to silence the Pyricularia oryzae genome in rice blast.,"Rice (Oryza sativa) is a staple food for billions of people across the globe, that feeds nearly three-quarters of the human population on Earth, particularly in Asian countries. Rice yield has been drastically reduced and severely affected by various biotic and abiotic stresses, especially pathogens. Controlling the attack of such pathogens is a matter of immediate concern as yield losses in rice crops could deprive millions of lives of nourishment worldwide. Pyricularia oryzae is one such pathogen that has been considered the major disease of rice because of its worldwide geographic distribution. P. oryzae belongs to the kingdom fungi, that causes rice blast ultimately adversely affecting the yield of the rice crop. Keeping in view this alarming scenario, the present study was designed so that the identifications of genome-encoded miRNAs of Oryza sativa were employed to target and silence the genome of P. oryzae. This study accomplished the computational analysis of algorithms related to miRNA target prediction. Four computational target prediction algorithms i.e., psRNATarget, RNA22, miRanda, and RNAhybrid were utilized in this investigation. The consensus among target prediction algorithms was created to discover six miRNAs from the O. sativa genome with the conservation of the target site fully evaluated on the genome of P. oryzae. The discovery of these novel six miRNAs in Oryza sativa paved a strong way toward the control of this disease in rice. It will open doors for further research in the field of gene silencing in rice. These miRNAs can be designed and employed in the future as experimentation to create constructs regarding the silencing of P. oryzae in rice crops.

18357468,Rice lesion mimic mutants with enhanced resistance to diseases.,"Lesion mimic mutants are characterized by the formation of necrotic lesions in the absence of pathogens. Such genetic defects often result in enhanced resistance to pathogen infection and constitutive expression of defense response genes. To understand the genetic mechanisms leading to these mutations, we characterized 21 lesion mimic mutants isolated from IR64 rice mutant populations produced by mutagenesis with diepoxybutane (D), gamma rays (G), and fast neutrons (F). Four mutations are controlled by single dominant genes, one of which is inherited maternally. Five lesion mimics are allelic to known spotted leaf (spl) mutants spl1, spl2, spl3, or spl6. In total, 11 new lesion mimic mutations, named spl16, spl17, and spl19 through Spl27, were established based on allelism tests. Two lesion mimics, spl17 and Spl26 showed enhanced resistance to multiple strains of Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast pathogen, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the bacterial blight (BB) pathogen. Co-segregation analyses of blast and BB resistance and lesion mimic phenotypes in segregating populations of spl17 and Spl26 indicate that enhanced resistance to the two diseases is conferred by mutations in the lesion mimic genes.

30824005,Gene network mediated by WRKY13 to regulate resistance against sheath infecting fungi in rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"OsWRKY13 TF gene is known to play a regulatory role of signaling in physiological pathways related to either development or disease resistance in rice plants. Rice cultivars IR 50 and TRY 3, resistant and susceptible respectively to sheath blight, TRY 3 and CO 43 resistant and susceptible respectively to sheath rot were challenged with fungal pathogens and disease scoring was carried out. Percent Disease Index (PDI) was significantly higher in susceptible varieties than resistant varieties. RT-PCR and qPCR analyses of WRKY13 using RNA extracted from the plant tissues revealed higher WRKY13 expression in resistant varieties (both diseases) upon pathogen challenge compared to uninfected control and also the susceptible varieties. To compute and evaluate the possible molecular mechanism for observed resistance correlated to WRKY13 gene expression, rice gene expression profiles against bacterial leaf blight and leaf blast disease from ROAD database were used to prioritize the locus IDs that were used as input in RiceNet v2 tool. The expression of WRKY13-regulated TIFY9 gene was predicted and validated using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR along with WRKY12 and PR2. All three genes showed induced expression in R. solani challenged sheath blight resistant variety. WRKY12 and PR2 expression in S. oryzae challenged sheath rot resistant variety was higher. Agrobacterium mediated transformation was carried out in rice plants using overexpression construct of WRKY13 (agroinfection in seeds of varieties susceptible to sheath blight and sheath rot, followed by selection in antibiotic media, germinating and hardening of putative transgenic lines). Based on qPCR analysis, the expression level of WRKY13 and the co-expression levels of WRKY12, TIFY9 and PR2 were found higher in PCR-positive T<sub>1</sub> plants compared to wild-type. Infection bioassays in the transgenic plants of both varieties revealed enhanced resistance to the pathogens.

32927133,Signaling defense responses of upland rice to avirulent and virulent strains of Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) can cause large losses in crop yields, especially in upland rice systems. Avirulent strains of M. oryzae can induce resistance to subsequent attacks by virulent strains in plants. This study aimed to investigate the defense responses in upland rice challenged with a virulent strain of M. oryzae after acclimation with an avirulent strain. The avirulent strain decreased rice blast severity in the challenged plants. Induced resistance was characterized by a hypersensitive response and early accumulation of phenolic compounds. Scanning electron microscopy showed that M. oryzae conidia germinate and form appressoria, but do not colonize leaf tissues. The activities of pathogenesis-related proteins, total phenolic compounds, and salicylic acid (SA) were affected by acclimation to the avirulent strain. The activities of β-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and peroxidase, as well as the SA levels explained most of the variability in the rice plant responses to M. oryzae. In addition, OsXa13, OsMAPKKK74, OsAOS2, OsACO7, and OsMAS1 expression was modulated depending on the virulence of the M. oryzae strains. This modulation in gene expression is critical for infection and some of these mechanisms are targeted by effectors, resulting in enhanced susceptibility and pathogen infection. These results have practical importance in plant-pathogen interaction studies to identify resistance-relevant mechanisms against M. oryzae in upland rice.",rice blast magnaporthe oryzae cause large loss crop yield especially upland rice system avirulent strain oryzae induce resistance subsequent attack virulent strain plant study aimed investigate defense response upland rice challenged virulent strain oryzae acclimation avirulent strain avirulent strain decreased rice blast severity challenged plant induced resistance characterized hypersensitive response early accumulation phenolic compound scanning electron microscopy showed oryzae conidium germinate form appressoria colonize leaf tissue activity pathogenesisrelated protein total phenolic compound salicylic acid sa affected acclimation avirulent strain activity βglucanase phenylalanine ammonialyase peroxidase well sa level explained variability rice plant response oryzae addition osxa osmapkkk osaos osaco osmas expression modulated depending virulence oryzae strain modulation gene expression critical infection mechanism targeted effector resulting enhanced susceptibility pathogen infection result practical importance plantpathogen interaction study identify resistancerelevant mechanism oryzae upland rice,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['targeted effector']}",0
24841201,Palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of the rice resistance protein pit is critical for the activation of the small GTPase OsRac1.,"Nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing family proteins function as intracellular immune sensors in both plants and animals. In plants, the downstream components activated by NLR family proteins and the immune response mechanisms induced by these downstream molecules are largely unknown. We have previously found that the small GTPase OsRac1, which acts as a molecular switch in rice immunity, is activated by Pit, an NLR-type resistance (R) protein to rice blast fungus, and this activation plays critical roles in Pit-mediated immunity. However, the sites and mechanisms of activation of Pit in vivo remain unknown. To clarify the mechanisms involved in the localization of Pit, we searched for consensus sequences in Pit that specify membrane localization and found a pair of potential palmitoylation sites in the N-terminal coiled-coil region. Although wild-type Pit was localized mainly to the plasma membrane, this membrane localization was compromised in a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of Pit. The palmitoylation-deficient Pit displayed significantly lower affinity for OsRac1 on the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in failures of the Pit-mediated cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species, and disease resistance to rice blast fungus. These results indicate that palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of Pit is required for the interaction with and the activation of OsRac1 and that OsRac1 activation by Pit is vital for Pit-mediated disease resistance to rice blast fungus.",nucleotide binding domain leucinerich repeat nlrcontaining family protein function intracellular immune sensor plant animal plant downstream component activated nlr family protein immune response mechanism induced downstream molecule largely unknown previously found small gtpase osrac act molecular switch rice immunity activated pit nlrtype resistance r protein rice blast fungus activation play critical role pitmediated immunity however site mechanism activation pit vivo remain unknown clarify mechanism involved localization pit searched consensus sequence pit specify membrane localization found pair potential palmitoylation site nterminal coiledcoil region although wildtype pit localized mainly plasma membrane membrane localization compromised palmitoylationdeficient mutant pit palmitoylationdeficient pit displayed significantly lower affinity osrac plasma membrane thereby resulting failure pitmediated cell death production reactive oxygen specie disease resistance rice blast fungus result indicate palmitoylationdependent membrane localization pit required interaction activation osrac osrac activation pit vital pitmediated disease resistance rice blast fungus,4,"{'Disease': ['previously found small gtpase osrac act molecular switch rice immunity activated pit nlrtype resistance r protein rice blast fungus activation', 'failure pitmediated cell death production reactive oxygen specie disease resistance rice blast fungus result'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
22187088,Characteristic expression of rice pathogenesis-related proteins in rice leaves during interactions with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins play an important role in the disease resistance response. To better understand the function of rice PR proteins, we examined the expressions of ten PR proteins in rice leaves at different developmental stages with or without the interaction between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that most of the PR proteins were expressed in rice leaves in normal growth conditions, suggesting that they play a role in rice growth. Six out of ten PR proteins (PR1, PR2, PR3, PR4b, PR8, and PR-pha) showed enhanced expression in Xa21-mediated resistance responses at late stages after inoculation with Xoo. The remaining four PR proteins (PR5, PR6, PR15, and PR16) did not show changes in expression in the resistance response. The expressions of PR proteins in the resistance reaction were further compared with those in the susceptible reaction and a mock treatment. Interestingly, several of the PR proteins were expressed at the highest levels in the susceptible reaction and at the lowest levels in the mock treatment. Among the other four PR proteins, PR5 and PR16 showed changes in the abundance only in the susceptible response, while PR6 and PR15 showed no detectable difference in expression.

Root growth and shoot growth were significantly inhibited by d-allose but not by the other rare sugars.

The PR protein genes were not upregulated by other rare sugars. Furthermore, d-allose treatment of rice plants conferred limited resistance of the rice against the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae but the other tested sugars did not.

17576658,Epigenetic inheritance in rice plants.,"Epigenetics is defined as mechanisms that regulate gene expression without base sequence alteration. One molecular basis is considered to be DNA cytosine methylation, which reversibly modifies DNA or chromatin structures. Although its correlation with epigenetic inheritance over generations has been circumstantially shown, evidence at the gene level has been limited. The present study aims to find genes whose methylation status directly correlates with inheritance of phenotypic changes. DNA methylation in vivo was artificially reduced by treating rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) seeds with 5-azadeoxycytidine, and the progeny were cultivated in the field for > 10 years. Genomic regions with changed methylation status were screened by the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphysm (MSAP) method, and cytosine methylation was directly scanned by the bisulfite mapping method. Pathogen infection with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, race PR2 was performed by the scissors-dip method on mature leaf blades. The majority of seedlings were lethal, but some survived to maturity. One line designated as Line-2 showed a clear marker phenotype of dwarfism, which was stably inherited by the progeny over nine generations. MSAP screening identified six fragments, among which two were further characterized by DNA blot hybridization and direct methylation mapping. One clone encoding a retrotransposon gag-pol polyprotein showed a complete erasure of 5-methylcytosines in Line-2, but neither translocation nor expression of this region was detectable. The other clone encoded an Xa21-like protein, Xa21G. In wild-type plants, all cytosines were methylated within the promoter region, whereas in Line-2, corresponding methylation was completely erased throughout generations. Expression of Xa21G was not detectable in wild type but was constitutive in Line-2. When infected with X. oryzae pv. oryzae, against which Xa21 confers resistance in a gene-for-gene manner, the progeny of Line-2 were apparently resistant while the wild type was highly susceptible without Xa21G expression. These results indicated that demethylation was selective in Line-2, and that promoter demethylation abolished the constitutive silencing of Xa21G due to hypermethylation, resulting in acquisition of disease resistance. Both hypomethylation and resistant trait were stably inherited. This is a clear example of epigenetic inheritance, and supports the idea of Lamarckian inheritance which suggested acquired traits to be heritable.",epigenetics defined mechanism regulate gene expression without base sequence alteration one molecular basis considered dna cytosine methylation reversibly modifies dna chromatin structure although correlation epigenetic inheritance generation circumstantially shown evidence gene level limited present study aim find gene whose methylation status directly correlate inheritance phenotypic change dna methylation vivo artificially reduced treating rice oryza sativa ssp japonica seed azadeoxycytidine progeny cultivated field year genomic region changed methylation status screened methylationsensitive amplified polymorphysm msap method cytosine methylation directly scanned bisulfite mapping method pathogen infection xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae race pr performed scissorsdip method mature leaf blade majority seedling lethal survived maturity one line designated line showed clear marker phenotype dwarfism stably inherited progeny nine generation msap screening identified six fragment among two characterized dna blot hybridization direct methylation mapping one clone encoding retrotransposon gagpol polyprotein showed complete erasure methylcytosines line neither translocation expression region detectable clone encoded xalike protein xag wildtype plant cytosine methylated within promoter region whereas line corresponding methylation completely erased throughout generation expression xag detectable wild type constitutive line infected x oryzae pv oryzae xa confers resistance geneforgene manner progeny line apparently resistant wild type highly susceptible without xag expression result indicated demethylation selective line promoter demethylation abolished constitutive silencing xag due hypermethylation resulting acquisition disease resistance hypomethylation resistant trait stably inherited clear example epigenetic inheritance support idea lamarckian inheritance suggested acquired trait heritable,2,"{'Disease': ['xag due hypermethylation resulting acquisition disease resistance hypomethylation'], 'Treatment': ['scissorsdip method'], 'Symptom': []}",3
20858844,Tissue-adapted invasion strategies of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast, the most serious foliar fungal disease of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). During hemibiotrophic leaf infection, the pathogen simultaneously combines biotrophic and necrotrophic growth. Here, we provide cytological and molecular evidence that, in contrast to leaf tissue infection, the fungus adopts a uniquely biotrophic infection strategy in roots for a prolonged period and spreads without causing a loss of host cell viability. Consistent with a biotrophic lifestyle, intracellularly growing hyphae of M. oryzae are surrounded by a plant-derived membrane. Global, temporal gene expression analysis used to monitor rice responses to progressive root infection revealed a rapid but transient induction of basal defense-related gene transcripts, indicating perception of the pathogen by the rice root. Early defense gene induction was followed by suppression at the onset of intracellular fungal growth, consistent with the biotrophic nature of root invasion. By contrast, during foliar infection, the vast majority of these transcripts continued to accumulate or increased in abundance. Furthermore, induction of necrotrophy-associated genes during early tissue penetration, previously observed in infected leaves, was not seen in roots. Collectively, our results not only report a global characterization of transcriptional root responses to a biotrophic fungal pathogen but also provide initial evidence for tissue-adapted fungal infection strategies.",magnaporthe oryzae cause rice blast serious foliar fungal disease cultivated rice oryza sativa hemibiotrophic leaf infection pathogen simultaneously combine biotrophic necrotrophic growth provide cytological molecular evidence contrast leaf tissue infection fungus adopts uniquely biotrophic infection strategy root prolonged period spread without causing loss host cell viability consistent biotrophic lifestyle intracellularly growing hypha oryzae surrounded plantderived membrane global temporal gene expression analysis used monitor rice response progressive root infection revealed rapid transient induction basal defenserelated gene transcript indicating perception pathogen rice root early defense gene induction followed suppression onset intracellular fungal growth consistent biotrophic nature root invasion contrast foliar infection vast majority transcript continued accumulate increased abundance furthermore induction necrotrophyassociated gene early tissue penetration previously observed infected leaf seen root collectively result report global characterization transcriptional root response biotrophic fungal pathogen also provide initial evidence tissueadapted fungal infection strategy,3,"{'Disease': ['cytological molecular evidence contrast leaf tissue infection fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
29695083,The Commonly Used Bactericide Bismerthiazol Promotes Rice Defenses against Herbivores.,"Chemical elicitors that enhance plant resistance to pathogens have been extensively studied, however, chemical elicitors that induce plant defenses against insect pests have received little attention. Here, we found that the exogenous application of a commonly used bactericide, bismerthiazol, on rice induced the biosynthesis of constitutive and/or elicited jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-isoleucine conjugate (JA-Ile), ethylene and H₂O₂ but not salicylic acid. These activated signaling pathways altered the volatile profile of rice plants. White-backed planthopper (WBPH, <i>Sogatella furcifera</i>) nymphs and gravid females showed a preference for feeding and/or oviposition on control plants: survival rates were better and more eggs were laid than on bismerthiazol-treated plants. Moreover, bismerthiazol treatment also increased both the parasitism rate of WBPH eggs laid on plants in the field by <i>Anagrus nilaparvatae</i>, and also the resistance of rice to the brown planthopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> and the striped stem borer (SSB) <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>.

27000073,Live-cell fluorescence imaging to investigate the dynamics of plant cell death during infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Plant cell death plays important roles during plant-pathogen interactions. To study pathogen-induced cell death, there is a need for cytological tools that allow determining not only host cell viability, but also cellular events leading to cell death with visualization of pathogen development. Here we describe a live cell imaging method to provide insights into the dynamics of cell death in rice (Oryza sativa). This method uses live-cell confocal microscopy of rice sheath cells mechanically damaged or invaded by fluorescently-tagged Magnaporthe oryzae together with fluorescent dyes fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI). FDA stains the cytoplasm of live cells exclusively, thus also visualizing the vacuole, whereas PI stains nuclei of dead cells. We first demonstrated that confocal microscopy of rice leaf sheaths stained with FDA and PI discriminated between live cells and mechanically-killed cells. FDA-derived fluorescein was confined to the cytoplasm of live cells, indicating the intact vacuolar and plasma membranes. We also observed previously unreported fluorescein patterns in mechanically damaged cells. These patterns include: (1) homogeneous distribution of fluorescein in the increased area of the cytoplasm due to the shrunken vacuole; (2) the increase of the fluorescein intensity; and (3) containment of the brighter fluorescein signal only in affected cells likely due to closure of plasmodesmata. We refer to these as novel fluorescein patterns in this study. Simultaneous imaging of fluorescently-tagged M. oryzae (red) and FDA staining (green) in rice cells revealed characteristic features of the hemibiotrophic interaction. That is, newly invaded cells are alive but subsequently become dead when the fungus spreads into neighbor cells, and biotrophic interfacial complexes are associated with the host cytoplasm. This also revealed novel fluorescein patterns in invaded cells. Time-lapse imaging suggested that the FDA staining pattern in the infected host cell progressed from typical cytoplasmic localization (live cell with the intact vacuole), to novel patterns (dying cell with closed plasmodesmata with the shrunken or ruptured vacuole), to lack of fluorescence (dead cell). We have developed a method to visualize cellular events leading to host cell death during rice blast disease. This method can be used to compare and contrast host cell death associated with disease resistance and susceptibility in rice-M. oryzae and other host-pathogen interactions.",plant cell death play important role plantpathogen interaction study pathogeninduced cell death need cytological tool allow determining host cell viability also cellular event leading cell death visualization pathogen development describe live cell imaging method provide insight dynamic cell death rice oryza sativa method us livecell confocal microscopy rice sheath cell mechanically damaged invaded fluorescentlytagged magnaporthe oryzae together fluorescent dye fluorescein diacetate fda propidium iodide pi fda stain cytoplasm live cell exclusively thus also visualizing vacuole whereas pi stain nucleus dead cell first demonstrated confocal microscopy rice leaf sheath stained fda pi discriminated live cell mechanicallykilled cell fdaderived fluorescein confined cytoplasm live cell indicating intact vacuolar plasma membrane also observed previously unreported fluorescein pattern mechanically damaged cell pattern include homogeneous distribution fluorescein increased area cytoplasm due shrunken vacuole increase fluorescein intensity containment brighter fluorescein signal affected cell likely due closure plasmodesmata refer novel fluorescein pattern study simultaneous imaging fluorescentlytagged oryzae red fda staining green rice cell revealed characteristic feature hemibiotrophic interaction newly invaded cell alive subsequently become dead fungus spread neighbor cell biotrophic interfacial complex associated host cytoplasm also revealed novel fluorescein pattern invaded cell timelapse imaging suggested fda staining pattern infected host cell progressed typical cytoplasmic localization live cell intact vacuole novel pattern dying cell closed plasmodesmata shrunken ruptured vacuole lack fluorescence dead cell developed method visualize cellular event leading host cell death rice blast disease method used compare contrast host cell death associated disease resistance susceptibility ricem oryzae hostpathogen interaction,2,"{'Disease': ['dead fungus spread neighbor cell biotrophic interfacial complex associated host cytoplasm', 'compare contrast host cell death associated disease resistance susceptibility ricem'], 'Treatment': ['live cell imaging method', 'insight dynamic cell death rice oryza sativa method'], 'Symptom': []}",2

38825969,Proteomic signatures uncover phenotypic plasticity of susceptible and resistant genotypes by wall remodelers in rice blast.,"Molecular communication between macromolecules dictates extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics during pathogen recognition and disease development.

The alcohol-induced mice were orally treated with RMR at 307.5 mg/kg (1-fold), 615 mg/kg (2-fold), and 1537.5 mg/kg (5-fold) for 5 weeks, whereas controls received vehicle only. Treatment with RMR significantly attenuated the increased level of serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) and hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol accumulation. Furthermore, RMR elevates hepatic antioxidant ability that reduced hepatic cell damage (steatosis) and decreased tissue inflammatory cytokine levels. These findings suggest that Monascus-fermented RMR may represent a novel, protective strategy against alcoholic liver disease by attenuating oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and steatosis.",monascus purpureus ntu fermented rice reported exhibit wide variety biological effect including antitumor antihypertriglyceridemia antioxidant antiinflammatory activity however role pathogenesis alcoholic liver disease remains obscure study hepatoprotective effect monascusfermented red mold rice rmr evaluated vivo using chronic alcoholinduced mouse experimental model alcoholinduced mouse orally treated rmr mgkg fold mgkg fold mgkg fold week whereas control received vehicle treatment rmr significantly attenuated increased level serum transaminase aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase hepatic triglyceride total cholesterol accumulation furthermore rmr elevates hepatic antioxidant ability reduced hepatic cell damage steatosis decreased tissue inflammatory cytokine level finding suggest monascusfermented rmr may represent novel protective strategy alcoholic liver disease attenuating oxidative stress inflammatory response steatosis,2,"{'Disease': ['pathogenesis alcoholic liver disease', 'novel protective strategy alcoholic liver disease'], 'Treatment': ['vehicle treatment rmr'], 'Symptom': ['exhibit wide variety biological effect', 'obscure study hepatoprotective effect']}",1
38444161,The MYB transcription factor OsMYBxoc1 regulates resistance to Xoc by directly repressing transcription of the iron transport gene OsNRAMP5 in rice.,"Bacterial leaf streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is a continuous threat to rice cultivation, leading to substantial yield losses with socioeconomic implications. Iron ions are essential mineral nutrients for plant growth, but little information is available on how they influence mechanisms of rice immunity against Xoc. Here, we investigated the role of the myeloblastosis-related (MYB) transcriptional repressor OsMYBxoc1 in modulation of rice resistance through control of iron ion transport. Overexpression of OsMYBxoc1 significantly increased rice resistance, whereas OsMYBxoc1 RNA-interference lines and knockout mutants showed the opposite result. Suppression of OsMYBxoc1 expression dampened the immune response induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns. We demonstrated that OsMYBxoc1 binds specifically to the OsNRAMP5 promoter and represses transcription of OsNRAMP5. OsNRAMP5, a negative regulator of rice resistance to bacterial leaf streak, possesses metal ion transport activity, and inhibition of OsMYBxoc1 expression increased the iron ion content in rice. Activity of the ion-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging enzyme catalase was increased in plants with suppressed expression of OsMYBxoc1 or overexpression of OsNRAMP5. We found that iron ions promoted Xoc infection and interfered with the production of reactive oxygen species induced by Xoc. The type III effector XopAK directly inhibited OsMYBxoc1 transcription, indicating that the pathogen may promote its own proliferation by relieving restriction of iron ion transport in plants. In addition, iron complemented the pathogenicity defects of the RS105_ΔXopAK mutant strain, further confirming that iron utilization by Xoc may be dependent upon XopAK. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which OsMYBxoc1 modulates rice resistance by regulating iron accumulation and demonstrates that Xoc can accumulate iron ions by secreting the effector XopAK to promote its own infection.",bacterial leaf streak caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola xoc continuous threat rice cultivation leading substantial yield loss socioeconomic implication iron ion essential mineral nutrient plant growth little information available influence mechanism rice immunity xoc investigated role myeloblastosisrelated myb transcriptional repressor osmybxoc modulation rice resistance control iron ion transport overexpression osmybxoc significantly increased rice resistance whereas osmybxoc rnainterference line knockout mutant showed opposite result suppression osmybxoc expression dampened immune response induced pathogenassociated molecular pattern demonstrated osmybxoc bind specifically osnramp promoter represses transcription osnramp osnramp negative regulator rice resistance bacterial leaf streak possesses metal ion transport activity inhibition osmybxoc expression increased iron ion content rice activity iondependent hsubsubosubsub scavenging enzyme catalase increased plant suppressed expression osmybxoc overexpression osnramp found iron ion promoted xoc infection interfered production reactive oxygen specie induced xoc type iii effector xopak directly inhibited osmybxoc transcription indicating pathogen may promote proliferation relieving restriction iron ion transport plant addition iron complemented pathogenicity defect rsδxopak mutant strain confirming iron utilization xoc may dependent upon xopak conclusion study reveals novel mechanism osmybxoc modulates rice resistance regulating iron accumulation demonstrates xoc accumulate iron ion secreting effector xopak promote infection,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['xoc infection interfered production reactive oxygen specie induced xoc type iii effector xopak directly inhibited osmybxoc transcription', 'iron ion secreting effector xopak']}",1
31493565,Engineering Broad-Spectrum Bacterial Blight Resistance by Simultaneously Disrupting Variable TALE-Binding Elements of Multiple Susceptibility Genes in Rice.,"Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice, employs the transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) to induce the expression of the OsSWEET family of putative sugar transporter genes, which function in conferring disease susceptibility (S) in rice plants. To engineer broad-spectrum bacterial blight resistance, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to disrupt the TALE-binding elements (EBEs) of two S genes, OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14, in rice cv. Kitaake, which harbors the recessive resistance allele of Xa25/OsSWEET13. The engineered rice line MS14K exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to most Xoo strains with a few exceptions, suggesting that the compatible strains may contain new TALEs. We identified two PthXo2-like TALEs, Tal5<sub>LN18</sub> and Tal7<sub>PXO61</sub>, as major virulence factors in the compatible Xoo strains LN18 and PXO61, respectively, and found that Xoo encodes at least five types of PthXo2-like effectors. Given that PthXo2/PthXo2.1 target OsSWEET13 for transcriptional activation, the genomes of 3000 rice varieties were analyzed for EBE variationsin the OsSWEET13 promoter, and 10 Xa25-like haplotypes were identified. We found that Tal5<sub>LN18</sub> and Tal7<sub>PXO61</sub> bind slightly different EBE sequences in the OsSWEET13 promoter to activate its expression. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was then used to generate InDels in the EBE of the OsSWEET13 promoter in MS14K to creat a new germplasm with three edited OsSWEET EBEs and broad-spectrum resistance against all Xoo strains tested. Collectively, our findings illustrate how to disarm TALE-S co-evolved loci to generate broad-spectrum resistance through the loss of effector-triggered susceptibility in plants.",xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo causal agent bacterial blight rice employ transcription activatorlike effector tale induce expression ossweet family putative sugar transporter gene function conferring disease susceptibility rice plant engineer broadspectrum bacterial blight resistance used crisprcasmediated gene editing disrupt talebinding element ebes two gene ossweet ossweet rice cv kitaake harbor recessive resistance allele xaossweet engineered rice line msk exhibited broadspectrum resistance xoo strain exception suggesting compatible strain may contain new tale identified two pthxolike tale talsublnsub talsubpxosub major virulence factor compatible xoo strain ln pxo respectively found xoo encodes least five type pthxolike effector given pthxopthxo target ossweet transcriptional activation genome rice variety analyzed ebe variationsin ossweet promoter xalike haplotype identified found talsublnsub talsubpxosub bind slightly different ebe sequence ossweet promoter activate expression crisprcas technology used generate indels ebe ossweet promoter msk creat new germplasm three edited ossweet ebes broadspectrum resistance xoo strain tested collectively finding illustrate disarm tale coevolved locus generate broadspectrum resistance loss effectortriggered susceptibility plant,4,"{'Disease': ['putative sugar transporter gene function conferring disease susceptibility rice plant engineer broadspectrum bacterial blight resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector tale', 'xoo encodes least five type pthxolike effector']}",3
20615111,Phytoalexin accumulation in the interaction between rice and the blast fungus.,"Blast fungus-induced accumulations of major rice diterpene phytoalexins (PA), momilactones A and B, and phytocassanes A through E were studied, focusing on their biosynthesis and detoxification. In resistant rice, all PA started to accumulate at 2 days postinoculation (dpi), at which hypersensitive reaction (HR)-specific small lesions became visible and increased 500- to 1,000-fold at 4 dpi, while the accumulation was delayed and several times lower in susceptible rice. Expression of PA biosynthetic genes was transiently induced at 2 dpi only in resistant plants, while it was highly induced in both plants at 4 dpi. Fungal growth was severely suppressed in resistant plants by 2 dpi but considerably increased at 3 to 4 dpi in susceptible plants. Momilactone A treatment suppressed fungal growth in planta and in vitro, and the fungus detoxified the PA in vitro. These results indicate that HR-associated rapid PA biosynthesis induces severe restriction of fungus, allowing higher PA accumulation in resistant rice, while in susceptible rice, failure of PA accumulation at the early infection stage allows fungal growth. Detoxification of PA would be a tactic of fungus to invade the host plant, and prompt induction of PA biosynthesis upon HR would be a trait of resistant rice to restrict blast fungus.",blast fungusinduced accumulation major rice diterpene phytoalexins pa momilactones b phytocassanes e studied focusing biosynthesis detoxification resistant rice pa started accumulate day postinoculation dpi hypersensitive reaction hrspecific small lesion became visible increased fold dpi accumulation delayed several time lower susceptible rice expression pa biosynthetic gene transiently induced dpi resistant plant highly induced plant dpi fungal growth severely suppressed resistant plant dpi considerably increased dpi susceptible plant momilactone treatment suppressed fungal growth planta vitro fungus detoxified pa vitro result indicate hrassociated rapid pa biosynthesis induces severe restriction fungus allowing higher pa accumulation resistant rice susceptible rice failure pa accumulation early infection stage allows fungal growth detoxification pa would tactic fungus invade host plant prompt induction pa biosynthesis upon hr would trait resistant rice restrict blast fungus,3,"{'Disease': ['fungal growth planta vitro fungus', 'severe restriction fungus', 'fungus invade host plant prompt induction pa biosynthesis', 'resistant rice restrict blast fungus'], 'Treatment': ['resistant plant dpi considerably increased dpi susceptible plant momilactone treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",0
38294722,Unveiling the mechanism of broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice: The collaborative role of transcription factor OsGRAS30 and histone deacetylase OsHDAC1.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, significantly impacts grain yield, necessitating the identification of broad-spectrum resistance genes and their functional mechanisms for disease-resistant crop breeding. Here, we report that rice with knockdown OsHDAC1 gene expression displays enhanced broad-spectrum blast resistance without effects on plant height and tiller numbers compared to wild-type rice, while rice overexpressing OsHDAC1 is more susceptible to M. oryzae. We identify a novel blast resistance transcription factor, OsGRAS30, which genetically acts upstream of OsHDAC1 and interacts with OsHDAC1 to suppress its enzymatic activity. This inhibition increases the histone H3K27ac level, thereby boosting broad-spectrum blast resistance. Integrating genome-wide mapping of OsHDAC1 and H3K27ac targets with RNA sequencing analysis unveils how OsHDAC1 mediates the expression of OsSSI2, OsF3H, OsRLR1 and OsRGA5 to regulate blast resistance. Our findings reveal that the OsGRAS30-OsHDAC1 module is critical to rice blast control.

24467890,Enhanced resistance to blast fungus in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by expressing the ribosome-inactivating protein α-momorcharin.,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the three major diseases that seriously affect the rice production. Alpha-momorcharin (α-MC), a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) isolated from Momordica charantia seeds, has antifungal effects in vitro. In this study, the α-MC gene was constitutively expressed under the control of the 2×35S promoter in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method. The nine transgenic plants were obtained and confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR, and the four (B2, B4, B7 and B9) of them whose copy numbers were 1, 2, 3 and 3, respectively, were shown to express the α-MC protein by Western blot. The molecular weight of α-MC in transgenic plants was approximately 38 kDa larger than the purified α-MC protein (28 kDa) in vitro. When the confirmed T1 generations were inoculated with a suspension of M. grisea spores for ten days, the lesions on leaves of transgenic plants were much lesser than those found on wild type (WT). According to the criteria of International Rice Research Institute standard, the mean values for morbidity and disease index numbers were 29.8% and 14.9%, respectively, which were lower than for WT.

Our study revealed that bsr-d1 mainly regulates the redox state of plant cells, but also affects amino acid and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. We further found that BSR-D1 indirectly regulates salicylic acid biosynthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction downstream of the activation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> signalling in the bsr-d1-mediated immune response. Furthermore, we identified a novel peroxidase-encoding gene, Perox3, as a new BSR-D1 target gene that reduces resistance to M. oryzae when overexpressed in TP309.

It poses a significant threat to global rice productivity, resulting in approximately 50% annual yield loss. Managing ShB is particularly challenging due to the broad host range of the pathogen, its necrotrophic nature, the emergence of new races, and the limited availability of highly resistant germplasm. In this study, we conducted QTL mapping using an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a cross between a partially resistant accession (IRGC81941A) of <i>Oryza nivara</i> and the susceptible rice cultivar Punjab rice 121 (PR121).

20852017,The bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae overcomes rice defenses by regulating host copper redistribution.,"Pathogen effectors are virulence factors causing plant diseases. How the host targets of these effectors facilitate pathogen infection is largely unknown. An effector of Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) transcriptionally activates rice (Oryza sativa) susceptibility gene Xa13 to cause bacterial blight disease. Xa13 encodes an indispensable plasma membrane protein of the MtN3/saliva family, which is prevalent in eukaryotes with unknown biochemical function. We show that the XA13 protein cooperates with two other proteins, COPT1 and COPT5, to promote removal of copper from xylem vessels, where Xoo multiplies and spreads to cause disease. Copper, an essential micronutrient of plants and an important element for a number of pesticides in agriculture, suppresses Xoo growth. Xoo strain PXO99 is more sensitive to copper than other strains; its infection of rice is associated with activation of XA13, COPT1, and COPT5, which modulate copper redistribution in rice.

23602104,Oscyp71Z2 involves diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis that contributes to bacterial blight resistance in rice.,"Bacterial blight is one of the most destructive rice diseases, which caused by Xoo, and results in yield losses, endangering worldwide food security. Diterpenoid phytoalexins, a type of antimicrobials produced in rice, are critical for resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. This article reports the characterization of the cytochrome P450 gene Oscyp71Z2, which belongs to the CYP71Z subfamily. Overexpression of Oscyp71Z2 in rice enhanced resistance to Xoo at the booting stage. The accumulation of phytoalexins was rapidly and strongly induced in Oscyp71Z2-overexpressing plants, and the transcript levels of genes related to the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway were elevated.

38687884,Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor homologs Pib and PibH8 interact and contribute to immunity in rice.,"Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) sense pathogen effectors and activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Many plant NLRs form pairs with other NLRs to recognize effectors and initiate ETI. PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN BL1 (Pib), an NLR protein in rice (Oryza sativa), activates resistance by recognizing the rice blast effector AvrPib. The activation of Pib is suppressed by SH3 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2 (OsSH3P2) in the absence of AvrPib. However, how Pib triggers defense responses and whether Pib pairs with another NLR are not clear. In this study, we identified Pib by map-based cloning and showed that a homolog of Pib, PIB HOMOLOGUE 8 (PibH8), interacts with Pib. Pib and PibH8 mediate resistance to the Magnaporthe oryzae isolate Guy11, a rice blast strain carrying AvrPib. Interestingly, the pib/pibh8 double mutant exhibited enhanced susceptibility to Guy11 compared to the single mutant. Furthermore, PibH8 can oligomerize through its coiled-coil (CC) domain, which also contributes to the Pib-PibH8 interaction, suggesting that Pib and PibH8 may form a complex to recognize AvrPib. OsSH3P2 inhibited the interaction of Pib and PibH8 through association with the CC domain of PibH8. Taken together, these results indicate that both Pib and PibH8 are required for rice blast resistance to M. oryzae carrying AvrPib, which is negatively regulated by OsSH3P2. This study not only identifies an NLR that functions in rice blast resistance but also reveals a possible complex immune strategy in which homologous NLR proteins may regulate the complete activation of plant immunity.",plant nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat receptor nlrs sense pathogen effector activate effectortriggered immunity eti many plant nlrs form pair nlrs recognize effector initiate eti piricularia oryzae resistance bl pib nlr protein rice oryza sativa activates resistance recognizing rice blast effector avrpib activation pib suppressed sh domaincontaining protein osshp absence avrpib however pib trigger defense response whether pib pair another nlr clear study identified pib mapbased cloning showed homolog pib pib homologue pibh interacts pib pib pibh mediate resistance magnaporthe oryzae isolate guy rice blast strain carrying avrpib interestingly pibpibh double mutant exhibited enhanced susceptibility guy compared single mutant furthermore pibh oligomerize coiledcoil cc domain also contributes pibpibh interaction suggesting pib pibh may form complex recognize avrpib osshp inhibited interaction pib pibh association cc domain pibh taken together result indicate pib pibh required rice blast resistance oryzae carrying avrpib negatively regulated osshp study identifies nlr function rice blast resistance also reveals possible complex immune strategy homologous nlr protein may regulate complete activation plant immunity,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['plant nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat receptor nlrs sense pathogen effector activate', 'rice blast effector avrpib activation']}",1

33317452,Comparative proteomic analysis reveals novel insights into the interaction between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"Bacterial blight, which is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is a devastating rice disease worldwide. Rice introgression line H471, derived from the recurrent parent Huang-Hua-Zhan (HHZ) and the donor parent PSBRC28, exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to Xoo, including to the highly virulent Xoo strain PXO99<sup>A</sup>, whereas its parents are susceptible to PXO99<sup>A</sup>. To characterize the responses to Xoo, we compared the proteome profiles of the host and pathogen in the incompatible interaction (H471 inoculated with PXO99<sup>A</sup>) and the compatible interaction (HHZ inoculated with PXO99<sup>A</sup>). In this study, a total of 374 rice differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) and 117 Xoo DAPs were detected in the comparison between H471 + PXO99<sup>A</sup> and HHZ + PXO99<sup>A</sup>. Most of the Xoo DAPs related to pathogen virulence, including the outer member proteins, type III secretion system proteins, TonB-dependent receptors, and transcription activator-like effectors, were less abundant in the incompatible interaction than in the compatible interaction. The rice DAPs were mainly involved in secondary metabolic processes, including phenylalanine metabolism and the biosynthesis of flavonoids and phenylpropanoids. Additionally, some DAPs involved in the phenolic phytoalexin and salicylic acid (SA) biosynthetic pathways accumulated much more in H471 than in HHZ after the inoculation with PXO99<sup>A</sup>, suggesting that phytoalexin and SA productions were induced faster in H471 than in HHZ. Further analyses revealed that the SA content increased much more rapidly in H471 than in HHZ after the inoculation, suggesting that the SA signaling pathway was activated faster in the incompatible interaction than in the compatible interaction. Overall, our results indicate that during an incompatible interaction between H471 and PXO99<sup>A</sup>, rice plants prevent pathogen invasion and also initiate multi-component defense responses that inhibit disease development.",bacterial blight caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo devastating rice disease worldwide rice introgression line h derived recurrent parent huanghuazhan hhz donor parent psbrc exhibit broadspectrum resistance xoo including highly virulent xoo strain pxosupasup whereas parent susceptible pxosupasup characterize response xoo compared proteome profile host pathogen incompatible interaction h inoculated pxosupasup compatible interaction hhz inoculated pxosupasup study total rice differentially abundant protein daps xoo daps detected comparison h pxosupasup hhz pxosupasup xoo daps related pathogen virulence including outer member protein type iii secretion system protein tonbdependent receptor transcription activatorlike effector less abundant incompatible interaction compatible interaction rice daps mainly involved secondary metabolic process including phenylalanine metabolism biosynthesis flavonoid phenylpropanoids additionally daps involved phenolic phytoalexin salicylic acid sa biosynthetic pathway accumulated much h hhz inoculation pxosupasup suggesting phytoalexin sa production induced faster h hhz analysis revealed sa content increased much rapidly h hhz inoculation suggesting sa signaling pathway activated faster incompatible interaction compatible interaction overall result indicate incompatible interaction h pxosupasup rice plant prevent pathogen invasion also initiate multicomponent defense response inhibit disease development,2,"{'Disease': ['oryzae xoo devastating rice disease', 'multicomponent defense response inhibit disease development'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['activatorlike effector']}",3

It was demonstrated that the spatial and temporal development of cytoplasmic aggregation, host cell autofluorescence, callose deposition and phospholipase D (PLD) accumulation were some of the earliest responses of host cells to M. grisea attacking and showed different patterns between the compatible and incompatible interaction. In the cv. IR64 and strain BN111 interaction (resistant), the earliest cellular response observed in the inner epidermis of rice leaf sheath was aggregation of the cytoplasm. Then, the attacked host cells turned brown and the cell cytoplasm collapsed (HR). In the moderately resistant reactions of cv. IR64 to strain PO66, the granule formation was delayed, and no apposition was observed in host cells. In the compatible reactions of cv. IR64 to strain Ca89, no visible cellular response was detected until 40 h after inoculation. As to auto-fluorescence of host cells, some penetration sites showed faint fluorescence under blue light as early as 12 h after inoculation in the cv. IR64-strain BN111 interaction. As the disease developed, the percentage of attacked epidermal cells showing autofluorescence increased quickly from 20 to 24 h after inoculation and the penetrated host cells showed strong autofluorescence. In the moderately resistant interaction, autofluorescence had been detected until 24 h after inoculation.

25869921,Development and evaluation of near-isogenic lines for major blast resistance gene(s) in Basmati rice.,"A set of NILs carrying major blast resistance genes in a Basmati rice variety has been developed. Also, the efficacy of pyramids over monogenic NILs against rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae has been demonstrated. Productivity and quality of Basmati rice is severely affected by rice blast disease. Major genes and QTLs conferring resistance to blast have been reported only in non-Basmati rice germplasm. Here, we report incorporation of seven blast resistance genes from the donor lines DHMASQ164-2a (Pi54, Pi1, Pita), IRBLz5-CA (Pi2), IRBLb-B (Pib), IRBL5-M (Pi5) and IRBL9-W (Pi9) into the genetic background of an elite Basmati rice variety Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1). A total of 36 near-isogenic lines (NILs) comprising of 14 monogenic, 16 two-gene pyramids and six three-gene pyramids were developed through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Foreground, recombinant and background selection was used to identify the plants with target gene(s), minimize the linkage drag and increase the recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery (93.5-98.6 %), respectively, in the NILs. Comparative analysis performed using 50,051 SNPs and 500 SSR markers revealed that the SNPs provided better insight into the RPG recovery. Most of the monogenic NILs showed comparable performance in yield and quality, concomitantly, Pusa1637-18-7-6-20 (Pi9), was significantly superior in yield and stable across four different environments as compared to recurrent parent (RP) PB1. Further, among the pyramids, Pusa1930-12-6 (Pi2+Pi5) showed significantly higher yield and Pusa1633-7-8-53-6-8 (Pi54+Pi1+Pita) was superior in cooking quality as compared to RP PB1. The NILs carrying gene Pi9 were found to be the most effective against the concoction of virulent races predominant in the hotspot locations for blast disease.

16045470,Alteration of TGA factor activity in rice results in enhanced tolerance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"In dicotyledonous plants broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens is established after the induction of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) response. In Arabidopsis the NPR1 protein can regulate SAR by interacting with members of the TGA class of basic, leucine-zipper transcription factors to alter pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression. Overexpression of (At)NPR1 in Arabidopsis enhances resistance to multiple pathogens. Similarly, overexpression of (At)NPR1 in rice enhances resistance to the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). These results suggest that components of the (At)NPR1-mediated SAR defense response may be conserved between monocots and dicots. To determine whether or not rice TGA factors are involved in disease resistance responses, the effect of altering the function of rice TGA2.1 was analyzed in transgenic plants. Transgenic rice overexpressing an rTGA2.1 mutant, that can no longer bind DNA, and transgenic rice that have the endogenous rTGA2.1 silenced by dsRNA-mediated silencing were generated. Both types of transgenic rice displayed increased tolerance to Xoo, were dwarfed, and had altered accumulation of PR genes. The results presented in this study suggest that wild-type rTGA2.1 has primarily a negative role in rice basal defense responses to bacterial pathogens.",dicotyledonous plant broadspectrum resistance pathogen established induction systemic acquired resistance sar response arabidopsis npr protein regulate sar interacting member tga class basic leucinezipper transcription factor alter pathogenesisrelated pr gene expression overexpression atnpr arabidopsis enhances resistance multiple pathogen similarly overexpression atnpr rice enhances resistance bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo result suggest component atnprmediated sar defense response may conserved monocot dicot determine whether rice tga factor involved disease resistance response effect altering function rice tga analyzed transgenic plant transgenic rice overexpressing rtga mutant longer bind dna transgenic rice endogenous rtga silenced dsrnamediated silencing generated type transgenic rice displayed increased tolerance xoo dwarfed altered accumulation pr gene result presented study suggest wildtype rtga primarily negative role rice basal defense response bacterial pathogen,2,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance response effect'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['disease resistance response effect']}",1
31713833,RNA-Seq revealed that infection with white tip nematodes could downregulate rice photosynthetic genes.,"White-tip nematode, Aphelenchoides besseyi is a kind of widely distributed migratory parasitic nematode that can infect plant shoots. Transcriptome sequencing of plant parasitic nematodes and their host plants is helpful for understanding their interaction relationship. This study first reported expression patterns of defense-related genes in rice, and rice transcriptomes at different periods after infection with A. besseyi. The result showed that the defense response pathways of rice changed obviously in the early stage of A. besseyi infection, including upregulated salicylic acid and jasmonate pathways and a downregulated ethylene pathway. Transcriptome analysis results suggested that A. besseyi infection was associated with the downregulation of multiple genes related to photosynthesis with possible suppression of the photosynthetic activity. It suggested that the photosynthesis system of rice could be suppressed by infections of migratory nematodes, including A. besseyi and Hirschmanniella oryzae, but was stimulated by that of a sedentary nematode, Meloidogyne graminicola, by comparing our study with the reported transcriptome. OS09G0417800 (OsWRKY62) might play an important role in the interaction of migratory nematodes and rice. It also indicated that the infection strategy of both A. besseyi and the reported migratory nematode H. oryzae was similar to that of the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea.

26772971,Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.,"Receptor-like kinases are well-known to play key roles in disease resistance. Among them, the Wall-associated kinases (WAKs) have been shown to be positive regulators of fungal disease resistance in several plant species. WAK genes are often transcriptionally regulated during infection but the pathways involved in this regulation are not known. In rice, the OsWAK gene family is significantly amplified compared to Arabidopsis. The possibility that several WAKs participate in different ways to basal defense has not been addressed. Moreover, the direct requirement of rice OSWAK genes in regulating defense has not been explored. Here we show using rice (Oryza sativa) loss-of-function mutants of four selected OsWAK genes, that individual OsWAKs are required for quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance. In addition, we show that the very early transcriptional regulation of the rice OsWAK genes is triggered by chitin and is partially under the control of the chitin receptor CEBiP. Finally, we show that OsWAK91 is required for H2O2 production and sufficient to enhance defense gene expression during infection. We conclude that the rice OsWAK genes studied are part of basal defense response, potentially mediated by chitin from fungal cell walls. This work also shows that some OsWAKs, like OsWAK112d, may act as negative regulators of disease resistance.",receptorlike kinase wellknown play key role disease resistance among wallassociated kinase waks shown positive regulator fungal disease resistance several plant specie wak gene often transcriptionally regulated infection pathway involved regulation known rice oswak gene family significantly amplified compared arabidopsis possibility several waks participate different way basal defense addressed moreover direct requirement rice oswak gene regulating defense explored show using rice oryza sativa lossoffunction mutant four selected oswak gene individual oswaks required quantitative resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae oswak oswak oswak positively regulate quantitative resistance oswakd negative regulator blast resistance addition show early transcriptional regulation rice oswak gene triggered chitin partially control chitin receptor cebip finally show oswak required ho production sufficient enhance defense gene expression infection conclude rice oswak gene studied part basal defense response potentially mediated chitin fungal cell wall work also show oswaks like oswakd may act negative regulator disease resistance,2,"{'Disease': ['key role disease resistance', 'positive regulator fungal disease resistance', 'negative regulator disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
24286630,The broad bacterial blight resistance of rice line CBB23 is triggered by a novel transcription activator-like (TAL) effector of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"Bacterial blight (BB), caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is not only a disease devastating rice production worldwide, but also an ideal model system for the study of the interaction between plants and their bacterial pathogens. The rice near-isogenic line (NIL) CBB23, derived from a cross between a wild rice Oryza rufipogon accession (RBB16) and a susceptible indica rice variety (Jingang 30), is highly resistant to all field Xoo strains tested so far. Although the BB resistance of CBB23 has been widely used in rice breeding programmes, the mechanism of its extremely broad-spectrum resistance remains unknown. Here, we report the molecular cloning of an avirulence gene, designated as avrXa23, from Xoo strain PXO99(A) . We validate that AvrXa23, a novel transcription activator-like effector, specifically triggers the broad-spectrum BB resistance in CBB23. The prevalence of avrXa23 in all 38 Xoo strains surveyed may explain the broad-spectrum feature of BB resistance in CBB23.

24892523,Overexpression of phosphomimic mutated OsWRKY53 leads to enhanced blast resistance in rice.,"WRKY transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regulation of plant defense responses. We previously reported that OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants showed enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. In this study, we identified OsWRKY53 as a substrate of OsMPK3/OsMPK6, components of a fungal PAMP-responsive MAPK cascade in rice, and analyzed the effect of OsWRKY53 phosphorylation on the regulation of basal defense responses to a virulence race of rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae strain Ina86-137. An in vitro phosphorylation assay revealed that the OsMPK3/OsMPK6 activated by OsMKK4 phosphorylated OsWRKY53 recombinant protein at its multiple clustered serine-proline residues (SP cluster). When OsWRKY53 was coexpressed with a constitutively active mutant of OsMKK4 in a transient reporter gene assay, the enhanced transactivation activity of OsWRKY53 was found to be dependent on phosphorylation of the SP cluster. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing a phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 (OsWRKY53SD) showed further-enhanced disease resistance to the blast fungus compared to native OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants, and a substantial number of defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes, were more upregulated in the OsWRKY53SD-overexpressing plants compared to the OsWRKY53-overexpressing plants. These results strongly suggest that the OsMKK4-OsMPK3/OsMPK6 cascade regulates transactivation activity of OsWRKY53, and overexpression of the phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 results in a major change to the rice transcriptome at steady state that leads to activation of a defense response against the blast fungus in rice plants.",wrky transcription factor mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk cascade shown play pivotal role regulation plant defense response previously reported oswrkyoverexpressing rice plant showed enhanced resistance rice blast fungus study identified oswrky substrate osmpkosmpk component fungal pampresponsive mapk cascade rice analyzed effect oswrky phosphorylation regulation basal defense response virulence race rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae strain ina vitro phosphorylation assay revealed osmpkosmpk activated osmkk phosphorylated oswrky recombinant protein multiple clustered serineproline residue sp cluster oswrky coexpressed constitutively active mutant osmkk transient reporter gene assay enhanced transactivation activity oswrky found dependent phosphorylation sp cluster transgenic rice plant overexpressing phosphomimic mutant oswrky oswrkysd showed furtherenhanced disease resistance blast fungus compared native oswrkyoverexpressing rice plant substantial number defenserelated gene including pathogenesisrelated protein gene upregulated oswrkysdoverexpressing plant compared oswrkyoverexpressing plant result strongly suggest osmkkosmpkosmpk cascade regulates transactivation activity oswrky overexpression phosphomimic mutant oswrky result major change rice transcriptome steady state lead activation defense response blast fungus rice plant,2,"{'Disease': ['enhanced resistance rice blast fungus study', 'osmpkosmpk component fungal pampresponsive mapk cascade rice analyzed effect oswrky phosphorylation regulation basal defense response virulence race rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'furtherenhanced disease resistance blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['osmpkosmpk component fungal pampresponsive mapk cascade rice analyzed effect oswrky phosphorylation regulation basal defense response virulence race rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae']}",3

These OsRLCKs interact with the rice brassinosteroid receptor, OsBRI1 in yeast cell, but not the XA21 immune receptor.

Also the seed treatments were studied to determine whether they directly influenced seedling emergence and growth in rice (Oryza sativa L) cultivars 'IR 20, IR 50, IR 64, ASD 16, ASD 19 and ADT 46' under greenhouse condition. MeSA seed treatments at 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/L significantly increased seedling emergence. Effects were stronger in IR 50, and IR 64 and the effects were dose dependent, although the relationship between dose and effect was not always linear. MeSA seed treated rice plant against bacterial blight were analyzed. Bacterial blight was more effectively controlled by the seed treated with 100 mg/L than others.

20435900,Translocation of Magnaporthe oryzae effectors into rice cells and their subsequent cell-to-cell movement.,"Knowledge remains limited about how fungal pathogens that colonize living plant cells translocate effector proteins inside host cells to regulate cellular processes and neutralize defense responses. To cause the globally important rice blast disease, specialized invasive hyphae (IH) invade successive living rice (Oryza sativa) cells while enclosed in host-derived extrainvasive hyphal membrane. Using live-cell imaging, we identified a highly localized structure, the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), which accumulates fluorescently labeled effectors secreted by IH. In each newly entered rice cell, effectors were first secreted into BICs at the tips of the initially filamentous hyphae in the cell. These tip BICs were left behind beside the first-differentiated bulbous IH cells as the fungus continued to colonize the host cell. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments showed that the effector protein PWL2 (for prevents pathogenicity toward weeping lovegrass [Eragrostis curvula]) continued to accumulate in BICs after IH were growing elsewhere. PWL2 and BAS1 (for biotrophy-associated secreted protein 1), BIC-localized secreted proteins, were translocated into the rice cytoplasm. By contrast, BAS4, which uniformly outlines the IH, was not translocated into the host cytoplasm. Fluorescent PWL2 and BAS1 proteins that reached the rice cytoplasm moved into uninvaded neighbors, presumably preparing host cells before invasion. We report robust assays for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underpin effector secretion into BICs, translocation to the rice cytoplasm, and cell-to-cell movement in rice.",knowledge remains limited fungal pathogen colonize living plant cell translocate effector protein inside host cell regulate cellular process neutralize defense response cause globally important rice blast disease specialized invasive hypha ih invade successive living rice oryza sativa cell enclosed hostderived extrainvasive hyphal membrane using livecell imaging identified highly localized structure biotrophic interfacial complex bic accumulates fluorescently labeled effector secreted ih newly entered rice cell effector first secreted bics tip initially filamentous hypha cell tip bics left behind beside firstdifferentiated bulbous ih cell fungus continued colonize host cell fluorescence recovery photobleaching experiment showed effector protein pwl prevents pathogenicity toward weeping lovegrass eragrostis curvula continued accumulate bics ih growing elsewhere pwl ba biotrophyassociated secreted protein biclocalized secreted protein translocated rice cytoplasm contrast ba uniformly outline ih translocated host cytoplasm fluorescent pwl ba protein reached rice cytoplasm moved uninvaded neighbor presumably preparing host cell invasion report robust assay elucidating molecular mechanism underpin effector secretion bics translocation rice cytoplasm celltocell movement rice,4,"{'Disease': ['globally important rice blast disease', 'firstdifferentiated bulbous ih cell fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['limited fungal pathogen colonize living plant cell translocate effector protein', 'fluorescently labeled effector', 'newly entered rice cell effector', 'effector protein pwl', 'effector secretion bics']}",4
10939258,Characterizing rice lesion mimic mutants and identifying a mutant with broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight.,"Many plant mutants develop spontaneous lesions that resemble disease symptoms in the absence of pathogen attack. In several pathosystems, lesion mimic mutations have been shown to be involved in programmed cell death, which in some instances leads to enhanced disease resistance to multiple pathogens. We investigated the relationship between spontaneous cell death and disease resistance in rice with nine mutants with a range of lesion mimic phenotypes. All nine mutations are controlled by recessive genes and some of these mutants have stunted growth and other abnormal characteristics. The lesion mimics that appeared on the leaves of these mutants were caused by cell death as measured by trypan blue staining. Activation of six defense-related genes was observed in most of the mutants when the mimic lesions developed. Four mutants exhibited significant enhanced resistance to rice blast. One of the mutants, spl11, confers non-race-specific resistance not only to blast but also to bacterial blight. The level of resistance in the spl11 mutant to the two pathogens correlates with the defense-related gene expression and lesion development on the leaves. The results suggest that some lesion mimic mutations in rice may be involved in disease resistance, and cloning of these genes may provide a clue to developing broad-spectrum resistance to diverse pathogens.",many plant mutant develop spontaneous lesion resemble disease symptom absence pathogen attack several pathosystems lesion mimic mutation shown involved programmed cell death instance lead enhanced disease resistance multiple pathogen investigated relationship spontaneous cell death disease resistance rice nine mutant range lesion mimic phenotype nine mutation controlled recessive gene mutant stunted growth abnormal characteristic lesion mimic appeared leaf mutant caused cell death measured trypan blue staining activation six defenserelated gene observed mutant mimic lesion developed four mutant exhibited significant enhanced resistance rice blast one mutant spl confers nonracespecific resistance blast also bacterial blight level resistance spl mutant two pathogen correlate defenserelated gene expression lesion development leaf result suggest lesion mimic mutation rice may involved disease resistance cloning gene may provide clue developing broadspectrum resistance diverse pathogen,1,"{'Disease': ['resemble disease symptom absence pathogen attack several pathosystems lesion mimic mutation', 'enhanced disease resistance multiple pathogen investigated relationship spontaneous cell death disease resistance rice nine mutant range lesion', 'disease resistance cloning gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['resemble disease symptom absence pathogen attack several pathosystems lesion mimic mutation']}",4

Heads remain upright at maturity, hence the name 'straighthead'. The diseased panicles may not emerge from the flag leaf sheath when the disease is severe. Straighthead disease in rice results in poorly developed panicles and significant yield loss. Although other soil physicochemical factors involved, arsenic contamination in soil has also been reported to be closely associated with straighthead of rice. Monosodium methanearsonate has been a popular herbicide in cotton production in the USA, which has shown to cause injuries in rice that are similar to straighthead. Since toxicity of inorganic arsenic (iAs) is higher than other forms of arsenic, it may produce a more severe straighthead disorder in rice.

33906570,Rhizosheath microbes induce root immune response under soil drying.,"The rhizosheath is an important drought-adaptive trait in roots of many angiosperms and has been regarded as a potential trait for future agricultural sustainability. In recent studies, we found that rice roots could form a pronounced rhizosheath under moderate soil drying (MSD) but not under continuous flooding irrigation (CF). The formation of rhizosheaths substantially changes the microbial community structure in endosphere root tissues and the rhizosphere in rice, which may induce a plant immune response. However, the manner by which the formation of rhizosheaths regulates the immune system of roots remains largely unknown. Here, we have analyzed the root transcriptomes of drought-tolerant rice and drought-sensitive rice under both MSD (rhizosheath-root) and CF (root without rhizosheath) conditions. Our results suggest that rhizosheath-associated microbes may trigger plant immune pathways in root under MSD, including the first line of defense component pattern-triggered immunity and the second line of defense component effector-triggered immunity.

32960916,A genome-wide association study in Indian wild rice accessions for resistance to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola.,"Rice root-knot nematode (RRKN), Meloidogyne graminicola is one of the major biotic constraints in rice-growing countries of Southeast Asia. Host plant resistance is an environmentally-friendly and cost-effective mean to mitigate RRKN damage to rice. Considering the limited availability of genetic resources in the Asian rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars, exploration of novel sources and genetic basis of RRKN resistance is necessary. We screened 272 diverse wild rice accessions (O. nivara, O. rufipogon, O. sativa f. spontanea) to identify genotypes resistant to RRKN. We dissected the genetic basis of RRKN resistance using a genome-wide association study with SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyped by 50K ""OsSNPnks"" genic Affymetrix chip. Population structure analysis revealed that these accessions were stratified into three major sub-populations. Overall, 40 resistant accessions (nematode gall number and multiplication factor/MF < 2) were identified, with 17 novel SNPs being significantly associated with phenotypic traits such as number of galls, egg masses, eggs/egg mass and MF per plant. SNPs were localized to the quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 and 11 harboring the candidate genes including NBS-LRR, Cf2/Cf5 resistance protein, MYB, bZIP, ARF, SCARECROW and WRKY transcription factors. Expression of these identified genes was significantly (P < 0.01) upregulated in RRKN-infected plants compared to mock-inoculated plants at 7 days after inoculation.

39341063,Noninvasive Raman spectroscopy for the detection of rice bacterial leaf blight and bacterial leaf streak.,"Plant diseases pose significant threats to agricultural yields and are responsible for nearly 20 % of losses in total food production. Therefore, the rapid detection of plant pathogens is critically important for preventing the rapid development of plant diseases and minimizing crop damage. Raman spectroscopy (RS) has been shown to be effective for detecting living biological samples. Compared with traditional detection methods, RS is fast, sensitive, and non-destructive; it also does not require sample labeling. In this study, we used Laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy combined with convolutional neural networks to detect two closely related strains of bacteria, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), exuded from bacteria-infected rice leaves. The accuracy of this technique was 97.5 %. For the application of RS in the field, we used the portable Raman spectrometer to detect mock-inoculated as well as Xoo- and Xoc-infected rice leaves at different disease courses. The identification accuracy via this technique was 87.02 % in the early stage, in which no obvious symptoms were apparent. This method also revealed spectral differences in rice leaves caused by the two bacteria, which could be leveraged for subsequent analysis of the molecular mechanism of infection.

The aim of this study was to explore the ability of wood biochar to induce resistance to the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne graminicola in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) and examine its histochemical and molecular impact on plant defense mechanisms. A 1.2 % concentration of biochar added to the potting medium of rice was found to be the most effective at reducing nematode development in rice roots, whereas direct toxic effects of biochar exudates on nematode viability, infectivity or development were not observed. The increased plant resistance was associated with biochar-primed H2O2 accumulation as well as with the transcriptional enhancement of genes involved in the ethylene (ET) signaling pathway. The increased susceptibility of the Ein2b-RNAi line, which is deficient in ET signaling, further confirmed that biochar-induced priming acts at least partly through ET signaling. These results suggest that biochar amendments protect rice plants challenged by nematodes.

The pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae, causing the disease is highly virulent to rice crops and is capable of evolving new races. Breeding efforts to incorporate single BB resistant gene often leads to resistance breakdown within a short period. To overcome such breakdown of resistance and develop germplasm with durable disease resistance, we have introgressed three bacterial blight resistance genes, xa5, xa13, and Xa21 into a fine grain rice variety, Samba Mahsuri, using sequence tagged site (STS) markers linked to these genes. Since the efficiency of the STS markers linked to recessive genes to detect homozygotes is less than 100%, we adopted four different pyramiding schemes to minimize loss of recessive resistance genes in advanced backcross generations. Pyramiding scheme A in which a two-gene Samba Mahsuri pyramid line containing Xa21 and xa5 genes was crossed with the Samba Mahsuri line having xa13 gene alone was found to be most effective in preventing the loss of an important recessive gene xa13.

25016378,Genetic diversity of the conserved motifs of six bacterial leaf blight resistance genes in a set of rice landraces.,"Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) caused by the vascular pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most serious diseases leading to crop failure in rice growing countries. A total of 37 resistance genes against Xoo has been identified in rice. Of these, ten BLB resistance genes have been mapped on rice chromosomes, while 6 have been cloned, sequenced and characterized. Diversity analysis at the resistance gene level of this disease is scanty, and the landraces from West Bengal and North Eastern states of India have received little attention so far. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity at conserved domains of 6 BLB resistance genes in a set of 22 rice accessions including landraces and check genotypes collected from the states of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and West Bengal. In this study 34 pairs of primers were designed from conserved domains of 6 BLB resistance genes; Xa1, xa5, Xa21, Xa21(A1), Xa26 and Xa27. The designed primer pairs were used to generate PCR based polymorphic DNA profiles to detect and elucidate the genetic diversity of the six genes in the 22 diverse rice accessions of known disease phenotype. A total of 140 alleles were identified including 41 rare and 26 null alleles. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) value was 0.56/primer pair. The DNA profiles identified each of the rice landraces unequivocally. The amplified polymorphic DNA bands were used to calculate genetic similarity of the rice landraces in all possible pair combinations. The similarity among the rice accessions ranged from 18% to 89% and the dendrogram produced from the similarity values was divided into 2 major clusters. The conserved domains identified within the sequenced rare alleles include Leucine-Rich Repeat, BED-type zinc finger domain, sugar transferase domain and the domain of the carbohydrate esterase 4 superfamily. This study revealed high genetic diversity at conserved domains of six BLB resistance genes in a set of 22 rice accessions.

However, little is known about the molecular response of rice to attacks by the smut pathogen. In this article, we define the initial infection process as having three stages: initial colonization on the pistil (stage 1, S1), amplification on the anther (stage 2, S2) and sporulation in the anther chambers (stage 3, S3). Based on the transcriptome of rice hosts in response to U. virens in two separate years, we identified 126, 204, and 580 specific regulated genes in their respective stages S1, S2, and S3, respectively, by excluding common expression patterns in other openly biotic/abiotic databases using bioinformatics. As the disease progresses, several stage-specific biological processes (BP) terms were distinctively enriched: ""Phosphorylation"" in stage S1, ""PCD"" in S2, and ""Cell wall biogenesis"" in S3, implying a concise signal cascade indicative of the tactics that smut pathogens use to control host rice cells during infection. 113 regulated genes were coexpressed among the three stages. They shared highly conserved promoter cis-element in the promoters in response to the regulation of WRKY and Myb for up-regulation, and ABA and Ca2+ for down regulation, indicating their potentially critical roles in signal transduction during rice-U. virens interaction. We further analyzed seven highly regulated unique genes; four were specific to pollen development, implying that pollen-related genes play critical roles in the establishment of rice susceptibility to U. virens.

31090421,Dissipation of Prothioconazole and Its Metabolite Prothioconazole-Desthio in Rice Fields and Risk Assessment of Its Dietary Intake.,"Rice is an important food crop, with a long history of cultivation in China, and is one of the important staple foods for Chinese today. However, the occurrence of rice diseases has had a substantial impact on its yield. At present, chemical control is the main means of prevention and control of rice diseases. As a high-efficacy and broad-spectrum fungicide, prothioconazole shows an ideal effect on the prevention and control of common rice diseases, but the residuals that remain after its use may have an impact on human health. In this paper, ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to develop a residue analysis method and explore the dissipation of prothioconazole and its metabolite prothioconazole-desthio in rice grain, rice husk, and rice plants, and the risks of chronic and acute dietary intake of prothioconazole in different Chinese populations were evaluated. The results showed that at a concentration range of 0.005-5.0 μg/mL, prothioconazole and its metabolites showed good linear correlations, and the correlation coefficients were all above 0.9992. The average recoveries of prothioconazole in three matrixes ranged from 80.0% to 99.7%, the RSD was between 1.54% and 11.0%, and the limit of quantitation was less than 0.01 μg/g. The sensitivity, accuracy, and precision of the established method all met the measurement requirements.

29164466,Bioagents and silicon promoting fast early upland rice growth.,"Upland rice can overcome major challenges through the insertion of silicate fertilization and the presence of plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPMs) during its cultivation, as these factors promote an increase in vigor and plant disease resistance. Two consecutive experiments were conducted to evaluate the beneficial effects of silicon fertilization combined with the PGPM, Pseudomonas fluorensces, Burkholderia pyrrocinia, and a pool of Trichoderma asperellum, in upland rice seedlings, cultivar BRS Primavera CL: (a) E1, selecting PGPM type and Si doses for rice growth promotion and leaf blast supression, and (b) E2, evaluating physiological characteristics correlated with mechanisms involved in the higher vegetative growth in highlighted treatments from E1. In E1, 2 Si t ha<sup>-1</sup> combined with the application of T. asperellum pool or PGPM mixture increased 54% in root dry matter biomass and 35 and 65% in shoot and root lengths, respectively; it also suppressed 99% of rice blast severity.

In this study, we found that the expression of <i>mohrip1</i> was significantly induced in the stages of fungal penetration and colonization. Although dispensable for the growth and conidiation, MoHrip1 was necessary for the full virulence of <i>M. oryzae</i>. Deletion of <i>mohrip1</i> remarkably compromised fungal virulence on rice seedlings and even on rice leaves with wounds. Rice sheath inoculation assay further demonstrated the defects of <i>mohrip1</i>-deleted mutants on penetration and proliferation in rice cells. Additionally, compared with WT and complementation strain, the inoculation of <i>mohrip1</i>-deleted mutants induced a higher expression of specific defense related genes and a higher production of specific defensive compounds in rice leaves.

To understand their differential virulence towards rice seedlings, we conducted a comparative survey in which three isolates each of P. arrhenomanes, P. graminicola and P. inflatum were selected to investigate host colonization, host responses and carbon utilization profiles using histopathological analyses, phenoarrays, DNA quantifications and gene expression studies. The isolate of the most virulent species, P. arrhenomanes, quickly colonized the outer and inner root tissues of rice seedlings, including the xylem, by which it possibly blocked the water transport and induced severe stunting, wilting and seedling death. The lower virulence of the tested P. graminicola and P. inflatum isolates seemed to be reflected in slower colonization processes, limited invasion of the vascular stele and less systemic spread, in which cell wall fortification appeared to play a role. Progressive hyphal invasions triggered the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phenolic compounds, which was the strongest for the P. arrhenomanes isolate and was delayed or much weaker upon inoculation with the P. inflatum isolate. The necrosis marker OsJamyb seemed faster and stronger induced by the most virulent isolates. Although the isolate of P. inflatum was nutritionally the most versatile, the most virulent Pythium isolate appeared physiologically more adapted to its host, evidenced by its broad amino acid utilization profile, including D-amino acids, L-threonine and hydroxyl-L-proline. The latter two compounds have been implicated in plant defense and their use by P. arrhenomanes could therefore represent a part of its virulence strategy. This study illustrates that the differential virulence of rice-pathogenic P. arrhenomanes, P. graminicola and P. inflatum isolates is related to their root colonization capacity, the intensity of induced root responses and their ability to utilize amino acids in their colonization niche. Accordingly, this paper presents important knowledge concerning rice root infections by oomycetes, which could be helpful to further disentangle virulence tactics of soil-borne pathogens.",progressive yield decline philippine aerobic rice field recently associated three closely related pythium spp p arrhenomanes p graminicola p inflatum understand differential virulence towards rice seedling conducted comparative survey three isolates p arrhenomanes p graminicola p inflatum selected investigate host colonization host response carbon utilization profile using histopathological analysis phenoarrays dna quantification gene expression study isolate virulent specie p arrhenomanes quickly colonized outer inner root tissue rice seedling including xylem possibly blocked water transport induced severe stunting wilting seedling death lower virulence tested p graminicola p inflatum isolates seemed reflected slower colonization process limited invasion vascular stele less systemic spread cell wall fortification appeared play role progressive hyphal invasion triggered production reactive oxygen specie ro phenolic compound strongest p arrhenomanes isolate delayed much weaker upon inoculation p inflatum isolate necrosis marker osjamyb seemed faster stronger induced virulent isolates although isolate p inflatum nutritionally versatile virulent pythium isolate appeared physiologically adapted host evidenced broad amino acid utilization profile including damino acid lthreonine hydroxyllproline latter two compound implicated plant defense use p arrhenomanes could therefore represent part virulence strategy study illustrates differential virulence ricepathogenic p arrhenomanes p graminicola p inflatum isolates related root colonization capacity intensity induced root response ability utilize amino acid colonization niche accordingly paper present important knowledge concerning rice root infection oomycetes could helpful disentangle virulence tactic soilborne pathogen,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
31906566,The Use of PTI-Marker Genes to Identify Novel Compounds that Establish Induced Resistance in Rice.,"Compounds that establish induced resistance (IR) in plants are promising alternatives for the pesticides that are progressively being banned worldwide. Screening platforms to identify IR-establishing compounds have been developed, but none were specifically designed for monocot plants. Here, we propose the use of an RT-qPCR screening platform, based on conserved immunity marker genes of rice as proxy for IR induction. Central regulators of biotic stress responses of rice were identified with a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), using more than 350 microarray datasets of rice under various sorts of biotic stress. Candidate genes were narrowed down to six immunity marker genes, based on consistent association with pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), both in rice plants as in rice cell suspension cultures (RCSCs). By monitoring the expression of these genes in RCSCs upon treatment with candidate IR-inducing compounds, we showed that our marker genes can predict IR induction in rice. Diproline, a novel IR-establishing compound for monocots that was detected with these marker genes, was shown to induce rice resistance against root-knot nematodes, without fitness costs. Gene expression profiling of the here-described PTI-marker genes can be executed on fully-grown plants or in RCSCs, providing a novel and versatile tool to predict IR induction.",compound establish induced resistance ir plant promising alternative pesticide progressively banned worldwide screening platform identify irestablishing compound developed none specifically designed monocot plant propose use rtqpcr screening platform based conserved immunity marker gene rice proxy ir induction central regulator biotic stress response rice identified weighted gene coexpression network analysis wgcna using microarray datasets rice various sort biotic stress candidate gene narrowed six immunity marker gene based consistent association patterntriggered immunity pti rice plant rice cell suspension culture rcscs monitoring expression gene rcscs upon treatment candidate irinducing compound showed marker gene predict ir induction rice diproline novel irestablishing compound monocot detected marker gene shown induce rice resistance rootknot nematode without fitness cost gene expression profiling heredescribed ptimarker gene executed fullygrown plant rcscs providing novel versatile tool predict ir induction,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['treatment candidate irinducing compound'], 'Symptom': []}",4
33782910,Efficacy of bioinoculants to control of bacterial and fungal diseases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in northwestern Himalaya.,"Biological control holds great promise for environmentally friendly and sustainable management of the phytopathogens. The multi-function features of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) enable to protect the plants from disease infections by replacing the chemical inputs. The interaction between the plant root exudates and the microbes stimulates the production of secondary metabolism and enzymes and induces systemic resistance in the plants. The aim was to identify the potential PGPR which would show an antagonistic effect against basmati rice fungal and bacterial diseases. In the study, native originating microbes have been isolated, characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing, and used as potential antagonistic microbial isolates against diseases of rice plants. Rhizobacteria isolated from rhizosphere, endo-rhizosphere, and bulk soil samples of Basmati 370 exhibited promising inhibitory activity against rice pathogens. Molecular characterization of bacterial isolates based on 16S rRNA sequencing classified the bacterial isolates into different genera such as Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Exiguobacterium, Aeromonas, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter, and Stenotrophomonas. PGPRs exhibited biocontrol activities against various rice diseases like bacterial leaf blight, leaf blast, brown spot, and sheath blight and boost the plant growth traits.

30679785,The rice CYP78A gene BSR2 confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice.,"The fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani causes devastating diseases in hundreds of plant species. Among these, R. solani causes sheath blight, one of the three major diseases in rice. To date, few genes have been reported that confer resistance to R. solani. Here, rice-FOX Arabidopsis lines identified as having resistance to a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, and a fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum higginsianum were screened for disease resistance to R. solani. BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE2 (BSR2), a gene encoding an uncharacterized cytochrome P450 protein belonging to the CYP78A family, conferred resistance to R. solani in Arabidopsis. When overexpressed in rice, BSR2 also conferred resistance to two R. solani anastomosis groups. Both Arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing BSR2 had slower growth and produced longer seeds than wild-type control plants. In contrast, BSR2-knockdown rice plants were more susceptible to R. solani and displayed faster growth and shorter seeds in comparison with the control. These results indicate that BSR2 is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis.",fungal pathogen rhizoctonia solani cause devastating disease hundred plant specie among r solani cause sheath blight one three major disease rice date gene reported confer resistance r solani ricefox arabidopsis line identified resistance bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc fungal pathogen colletotrichum higginsianum screened disease resistance r solani broadspectrum resistance bsr gene encoding uncharacterized cytochrome p protein belonging cypa family conferred resistance r solani arabidopsis overexpressed rice bsr also conferred resistance two r solani anastomosis group arabidopsis rice plant overexpressing bsr slower growth produced longer seed wildtype control plant contrast bsrknockdown rice plant susceptible r solani displayed faster growth shorter seed comparison control result indicate bsr associated disease resistance growth rate seed size rice suggest function evolutionarily conserved monocot rice dicot arabidopsis,2,"{'Disease': ['devastating disease hundred plant specie', 'one three major disease rice date gene', 'tomato dc fungal pathogen colletotrichum higginsianum screened disease resistance r solani broadspectrum resistance bsr gene', 'bsr associated disease resistance growth rate seed size rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

The strain was found positive for production of fungal cell wall degrading enzymes such as chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, β-1,4-glucanase, lipase and protease. The strain was also positive for plant growth promoting traits. It produced up to 30.5μg/ml of IAA and solubilized a significant amount of inorganic phosphate (up to 102μg/ml). It also produced 69% siderophore units. The strain also produced ammonia and gave positive result for ACC deaminase activity.

38727520,Selenium Nanomaterials Enhance Sheath Blight Resistance and Nutritional Quality of Rice: Mechanisms of Action and Human Health Benefit.,"In the current work, the foliar application of selenium nanomaterials (Se<sup>0</sup> NMs) suppressed sheath blight in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The beneficial effects were nanoscale specific and concentration dependent. Specifically, foliar amendment of 5 mg/L Se<sup>0</sup> NMs decreased the disease severity by 68.8% in <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>-infected rice; this level of control was 1.57- and 2.20-fold greater than that of the Se ions with equivalent Se mass and a commercially available pesticide (Thifluzamide). Mechanistically, (1) the controlled release ability of Se<sup>0</sup> NMs enabled a wider safe concentration range and greater bioavailability to Se<sup>0</sup> NMs, and (2) transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated that Se<sup>0</sup> NMs simultaneously promoted the salicylic acid- and jasmonic-acid-dependent acquired disease resistance pathways, antioxidative system, and flavonoid biosynthesis. Additionally, Se<sup>0</sup> NMs improved rice yield by 31.1%, increased the nutritional quality by 6.4-7.2%, enhanced organic Se content by 44.8%, and decreased arsenic and cadmium contents by 38.7 and 42.1%, respectively, in grains as compared with infected controls.

18192436,Activation of the indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase GH3-8 suppresses expansin expression and promotes salicylate- and jasmonate-independent basal immunity in rice.,"New evidence suggests a role for the plant growth hormone auxin in pathogenesis and disease resistance. Bacterial infection induces the accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the major type of auxin, in rice (Oryza sativa). IAA induces the expression of expansins, proteins that loosen the cell wall. Loosening the cell wall is key for plant growth but may also make the plant vulnerable to biotic intruders. Here, we report that rice GH3-8, an auxin-responsive gene functioning in auxin-dependent development, activates disease resistance in a salicylic acid signaling- and jasmonic acid signaling-independent pathway. GH3-8 encodes an IAA-amino synthetase that prevents free IAA accumulation. Overexpression of GH3-8 results in enhanced disease resistance to the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. This resistance is independent of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling. Overexpression of GH3-8 also causes abnormal plant morphology and retarded growth and development. Both enhanced resistance and abnormal development may be caused by inhibition of the expression of expansins via suppressed auxin signaling.",new evidence suggests role plant growth hormone auxin pathogenesis disease resistance bacterial infection induces accumulation indoleacetic acid iaa major type auxin rice oryza sativa iaa induces expression expansins protein loosen cell wall loosening cell wall key plant growth may also make plant vulnerable biotic intruder report rice gh auxinresponsive gene functioning auxindependent development activates disease resistance salicylic acid signaling jasmonic acid signalingindependent pathway gh encodes iaaamino synthetase prevents free iaa accumulation overexpression gh result enhanced disease resistance rice pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae resistance independent jasmonic acid salicylic acid signaling overexpression gh also cause abnormal plant morphology retarded growth development enhanced resistance abnormal development may caused inhibition expression expansins via suppressed auxin signaling,2,"{'Disease': ['role plant growth hormone auxin pathogenesis disease resistance bacterial infection', 'disease resistance salicylic acid'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
29358653,Bph6 encodes an exocyst-localized protein and confers broad resistance to planthoppers in rice.,"The brown planthopper (BPH) and white-backed planthopper (WBPH) are the most destructive insect pests of rice, and they pose serious threats to rice production throughout Asia. Thus, there are urgent needs to identify resistance-conferring genes and to breed planthopper-resistant rice varieties. Here we report the map-based cloning and functional analysis of Bph6, a gene that confers resistance to planthoppers in rice. Bph6 encodes a previously uncharacterized protein that localizes to exocysts and interacts with the exocyst subunit OsEXO70E1. Bph6 expression increases exocytosis and participates in cell wall maintenance and reinforcement. A coordinated cytokinin, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathway is activated in Bph6-carrying plants, which display broad resistance to all tested BPH biotypes and to WBPH without sacrificing yield, as these plants were found to maintain a high level of performance in a field that was heavily infested with BPH.

27532545,Plant Growth Promotion and Suppression of Bacterial Leaf Blight in Rice by Inoculated Bacteria.,"The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential of rice rhizosphere associated antagonistic bacteria for growth promotion and disease suppression of bacterial leaf blight (BLB). A total of 811 rhizospheric bacteria were isolated and screened against 3 prevalent strains of BLB pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) of which five antagonistic bacteria, i.e., Pseudomonas spp. E227, E233, Rh323, Serratia sp. Rh269 and Bacillus sp. Rh219 showed antagonistic potential (zone of inhibition 1-19 mm). Production of siderophores was found to be the common biocontrol determinant and all the strains solubilized inorganic phosphate (82-116 μg mL-1) and produced indole acetic acid (0.48-1.85 mg L-1) in vitro. All antagonistic bacteria were non-pathogenic to rice, and their co-inoculation significantly improved plant health in terms of reduced diseased leaf area (80%), improved shoot length (31%), root length (41%) and plant dry weight (60%) as compared to infected control plants. Furthermore, under pathogen pressure, bacterial inoculation resulted in increased activity of defense related enzymes including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase, along with 86% increase in peroxidase and 53% increase in catalase enzyme activities in plants inoculated with Pseudomonas sp. Rh323 as well as co-inoculated plants. Bacterial strains showed good colonization potential in the rice rhizosphere up to 21 days after seed inoculation. Application of bacterial consortia in the field resulted in an increase of 31% in grain yield and 10% in straw yield over non-inoculated plots. Although, yield increase was statistically non-significant but was accomplished with overall saving of 20% chemical fertilizers. The study showed that Pseudomonas sp.

27671120,Ethylene Biosynthesis and Signaling Is Required for Rice Immune Response and Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae Infection.,"Recent studies have suggested that ethylene enhances host resistance to fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Among the six 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase genes in rice, OsACS1 and OsACS2 are induced within 24 h of inoculation by M. oryzae. This induction occurs simultaneously with an increase in ethylene production that is noticeable 12 h postinoculation. The purpose of this study was to examine the dynamics of ethylene production and signaling in wild type and RNA interference-mediated suppression lines deficient in ethylene production (acs2) or signaling (eil1) after challenge with M. oryzae as well as fungal cell-wall elicitors. Ethylene-insensitive mutant lines show an attenuated basal defense response including lower basal expression of the genes encoding a chitin-binding receptor, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and the enzymes involved in the synthesis of diterprenoid phytoalexins, a reduction on early hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death, and reduced incidence of callose deposition. Ethylene-deficient mutants showed an intermediate phenotype, with a significant reduction in expression of defense-related genes and callose deposition, but only a slight reduction in HR-like cell death. As a result, all ethylene-insensitive mutants show increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, whereas the ethylene-deficient lines show a slight but less significant increase in disease severity.

31376807,Genome-wide alternative polyadenylation dynamics in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice.,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important way to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and is extensively involved in plant stress responses. However, the systematic roles of APA regulation in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in rice at the genome scale remain unknown. To take advantage of available RNA-seq datasets, using a novel tool APAtrap, we identified thousands of genes with significantly differential usage of polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites in response to the abiotic stress (drought, heat shock, and cadmium) and biotic stress [bacterial blight (BB), rice blast, and rice stripe virus (RSV)]. Genes with stress-responsive APA dynamics commonly exhibited higher expression levels when their isoforms with short 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) were more abundant. The stress-responsive APA events were widely involved in crucial stress-responsive genes and pathways: e.g. APA acted as a negative regulator in heat stress tolerance; APA events were involved in DNA repair and cell wall formation under Cd stress; APA regulated chlorophyll metabolism, being associated with the pathogenesis of leaf diseases under RSV and BB challenges. Furthermore, APA events were found to be involved in glutathione metabolism and MAPK signaling pathways, mediating a crosstalk among the abiotic and biotic stress-responsive regulatory networks in rice. Analysis of large-scale datasets revealed that APA may regulate abiotic and biotic stress-responsive processes in rice.

19522564,Suppression of the rice fatty-acid desaturase gene OsSSI2 enhances resistance to blast and leaf blight diseases in rice.,"Fatty acids and their derivatives play important signaling roles in plant defense responses. It has been shown that suppressing a gene for stearoyl acyl carrier protein fatty-acid desaturase (SACPD) enhances the resistance of Arabidopsis (SSI2) and soybean to multiple pathogens. In this study, we present functional analyses of a rice homolog of SSI2 (OsSSI2) in disease resistance of rice plants. A transposon insertion mutation (Osssi2-Tos17) and RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsSSI2 (OsSSI2-kd) reduced the oleic acid (18:1) level and increased that of stearic acid (18:0), indicating that OsSSI2 is responsible for fatty-acid desaturase activity. These plants displayed spontaneous lesion formation in leaf blades, retarded growth, slight increase in endogenous free salicylic acid (SA) levels, and SA/benzothiadiazole (BTH)-specific inducible genes, including WRKY45, a key regulator of SA/BTH-induced resistance, in rice. Moreover, the OsSSI2-kd plants showed markedly enhanced resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and leaf-blight bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results suggest that OsSSI2 is involved in the negative regulation of defense responses in rice, as are its Arabidopsis and soybean counterparts. Microarray analyses identified 406 genes that were differentially expressed (>or=2-fold) in OsSSI2-kd rice plants compared with wild-type rice and, of these, approximately 39% were BTH responsive. Taken together, our results suggest that induction of SA-responsive genes, including WRKY45, is likely responsible for enhanced disease resistance in OsSSI2-kd rice plants.",fatty acid derivative play important signaling role plant defense response shown suppressing gene stearoyl acyl carrier protein fattyacid desaturase sacpd enhances resistance arabidopsis ssi soybean multiple pathogen study present functional analysis rice homolog ssi osssi disease resistance rice plant transposon insertion mutation osssitos rnaimediated knockdown osssi osssikd reduced oleic acid level increased stearic acid indicating osssi responsible fattyacid desaturase activity plant displayed spontaneous lesion formation leaf blade retarded growth slight increase endogenous free salicylic acid sa level sabenzothiadiazole bthspecific inducible gene including wrky key regulator sabthinduced resistance rice moreover osssikd plant showed markedly enhanced resistance blast fungus magnaporthe grisea leafblight bacteria xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae result suggest osssi involved negative regulation defense response rice arabidopsis soybean counterpart microarray analysis identified gene differentially expressed orfold osssikd rice plant compared wildtype rice approximately bth responsive taken together result suggest induction saresponsive gene including wrky likely responsible enhanced disease resistance osssikd rice plant,2,"{'Disease': ['resistance arabidopsis ssi soybean multiple pathogen study present functional analysis rice homolog ssi osssi disease resistance rice plant transposon insertion mutation osssitos rnaimediated knockdown osssi osssikd', 'wrky likely responsible enhanced disease resistance osssikd rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
17909744,"A novel gene, Pi40(t), linked to the DNA markers derived from NBS-LRR motifs confers broad spectrum of blast resistance in rice.","Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea is a continuous threat to stable rice production worldwide. In a modernized agricultural system, the development of varieties with broad-spectrum and durable resistance to blast disease is essential for increased rice production and sustainability. In this study, a new gene is identified in the introgression line IR65482-4-136-2-2 that has inherited the resistance gene from an EE genome wild Oryza species, O. australiensis (Acc. 100882). Genetic and molecular analysis localized a major resistance gene, Pi40(t), on the short arm of chromosome 6, where four blast resistance genes (Piz, Piz-5, Piz-t, and Pi9) were also identified, flanked by the markers S2539 and RM3330. Through e-Landing, 14 BAC/PAC clones within the 1.81-Mb equivalent virtual contig were identified on Rice Pseudomolecule3. Highly stringent primer sets designed for 6 NBS-LRR motifs located within PAC clone P0649C11 facilitated high-resolution mapping of the new resistance gene, Pi40(t). Following association analysis and detailed haplotyping approaches, a DNA marker, 9871.T7E2b, was identified to be linked to the Pi40(t) gene at the 70 Kb chromosomal region, and differentiated the Pi40(t) gene from the LTH monogenic differential lines possessing genes Piz, Piz-5, Piz-t, and Pi-9. Pi40(t) was validated using the most virulent isolates of Korea as well as the Philippines, suggesting a broad spectrum for the resistance gene. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) and pathotyping of BC progenies having two japonica cultivar genetic backgrounds further supported the potential of the resistance gene in rice breeding. Our study based on new gene identification strategies provides insight into novel genetic resources for blast resistance as well as future studies on cloning and functional analysis of a blast resistance gene useful for rice improvement.",rice blast disease caused magnaporthe grisea continuous threat stable rice production worldwide modernized agricultural system development variety broadspectrum durable resistance blast disease essential increased rice production sustainability study new gene identified introgression line ir inherited resistance gene ee genome wild oryza specie australiensis acc genetic molecular analysis localized major resistance gene pit short arm chromosome four blast resistance gene piz piz pizt pi also identified flanked marker rm elanding bacpac clone within mb equivalent virtual contig identified rice pseudomolecule highly stringent primer set designed nbslrr motif located within pac clone pc facilitated highresolution mapping new resistance gene pit following association analysis detailed haplotyping approach dna marker teb identified linked pit gene kb chromosomal region differentiated pit gene lth monogenic differential line possessing gene piz piz pizt pi pit validated using virulent isolates korea well philippine suggesting broad spectrum resistance gene markerassisted selection ma pathotyping bc progeny two japonica cultivar genetic background supported potential resistance gene rice breeding study based new gene identification strategy provides insight novel genetic resource blast resistance well future study cloning functional analysis blast resistance gene useful rice improvement,1,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3

To investigate the relationship between the expression level of <i>XA21</i> and resulting resistance, we generated independent <i>HA-XA21</i> transgenic rice lines accumulating the XA21 immune receptor fused with an HA epitope tag. Whole-genome sequence analysis identified the T-DNA insertion sites in sixteen independent T0 events. Through quantification of the HA-XA21 protein and assessment of the resistance to <i>Xoo</i> strain PXO99 in six independent transgenic lines, we observed that XA21-mediated resistance is dose dependent. In contrast, based on the four agronomic traits quantified in these experiments, yield is unlikely to be affected by the expression level of <i>HA-XA21</i>.

28990717,Mechanisms of resistance in the rice cultivar Manikpukha to the rice stem nematode Ditylenchus angustus.,"The incompatible interaction between the rice cultivar Manikpukha and the rice stem nematode Ditylenchus angustus has been reported recently. This research focuses on the underlying mechanisms of resistance in Manikpukha. Invasion, post-infection development and reproduction of D. angustus were compared in compatible and incompatible interactions to identify the stage in which resistance occurs. The results indicate that resistance in Manikpukha is associated with reduced development and reproduction, implying that resistance acts post-invasion. We studied the possible involvement of three classical defence hormones, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), in response to infection in a compatible interaction using biosynthesis/signalling-deficient transgenic rice lines. All three hormones appear to have an influence on the basal defence of Nipponbare against the stem nematode. Although hormone application increases basal defences, expression studies and hormone analyses after nematode infection in Manikpukha did not show a clear involvement of the hormone defense pathways for SA, ET and JA. However, it seems that OsPAL1 plays a pivotal role in resistance, indicating that the phenylpropanoid pathway and its products might be key players in the incompatible interaction. Lignin measurement showed that, although basal levels are similar, Manikpukha had a significantly higher lignin content on nematode infection, whereas it was decreased in the susceptible cultivar. The results presented here show that SA, ET and JA are involved in basal defences, but the resistance of Manikpukha against D. angustus probably relies on products of the phenylpropanoid pathway.",incompatible interaction rice cultivar manikpukha rice stem nematode ditylenchus angustus reported recently research focus underlying mechanism resistance manikpukha invasion postinfection development reproduction angustus compared compatible incompatible interaction identify stage resistance occurs result indicate resistance manikpukha associated reduced development reproduction implying resistance act postinvasion studied possible involvement three classical defence hormone salicylic acid sa jasmonic acid ja ethylene et response infection compatible interaction using biosynthesissignallingdeficient transgenic rice line three hormone appear influence basal defence nipponbare stem nematode although hormone application increase basal defence expression study hormone analysis nematode infection manikpukha show clear involvement hormone defense pathway sa et ja however seems ospal play pivotal role resistance indicating phenylpropanoid pathway product might key player incompatible interaction lignin measurement showed although basal level similar manikpukha significantly higher lignin content nematode infection whereas decreased susceptible cultivar result presented show sa et ja involved basal defence resistance manikpukha angustus probably relies product phenylpropanoid pathway,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
12172799,"Genetic and physical mapping of a rice blast resistance locus, Pi-CO39(t), that corresponds to the avirulence gene AVR1-CO39 of Magnaporthe grisea.","We have identified, genetically mapped and physically delineated the chromosomal location of a new rice blast resistance locus, designated Pi-CO39(t). This locus confers resistance to Magnaporthe grisea isolates carrying the AVR1-CO39 avirulence locus. The AVR1-CO39 locus is conserved in non-rice (cereals and grasses)-infecting isolates of M. grisea, making Pi-CO39(t) useful for engineering M. grisea resistance in rice and other cereals. The resistance in the rice line CO39 was inherited as a single dominant locus in segregating populations derived from F(2) and F(3) crosses between disease-resistant (CO39) and susceptible (51583) rice genotypes. Microsatellite, RFLP and resistance gene analog (RGA) markers were used to map the Pi-CO39(t) locus to a 1.2-cM interval between the probenazole-responsive ( RPR1) gene (0.2 cM) and RFLP marker S2712 (1.0 cM) on the short arm of rice chromosome 11. RFLP markers G320 and F5003, and resistance gene analogs RGA8, RGA38 and RGACO39 were tightly linked to the Pi-CO39(t) locus (no recombination detected in a sample of ~2400 gametes). A large-insert genomic library of CO39 was constructed in the binary plant transformation vector pCLD04541. A library screen using RGA8, RGA38 and probes derived from the ends of CO39 clones, as well as BAC end probes from the corresponding locus in the rice cv. Nipponbare, resulted in the assembly of three CO39 contigs of 180 kb, 110 kb and 145 kb linked to the Pi-CO39(t) locus. A 650-kb contig was also constructed representing the susceptible locus, pi-CO39(t), in the Nipponbare genome.

27155478,Physiological changes promoted by a strobilurin fungicide in the rice-Bipolaris oryzae interaction.,"Strobilurins are among the most important fungicides that are used for plant disease control worldwide. In addition to their fungicide effect, strobilurins can also improve crop physiology. Nonetheless, the impact of azoxystrobin (Az), the main marketed strobilurin, on rice physiology is still unknown. Detailed gas exchange measurements and chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis were used to examine the Az effects on the photosynthetic performance of rice plants (cultivar Metica-1) either challenged or not with Bipolaris oryzae, the causal agent of brown spot. Az impaired carbon (C) fixation in the non-inoculated plants in a manner that was not related to photochemical or biochemical limitations, but rather to decreased stomatal conductance that limited the CO2 influx into the mesophyll cells. The photosynthesis of rice plants that were not sprayed with Az dramatically decreased upon B. oryzae infection, which was chiefly governed by photochemical and biochemical limitations. The energy surplus that was caused by limited C fixation in the rice plants that were treated with Az and inoculated with B. oryzae was thermally and effectively dissipated until 72h after inoculation. In Az absence, however, this mechanism was not sufficient to prevent chronic photoinhibition to photosynthesis. The inoculated plants were not able to fully capture and exploit the collected light energy, but these constraints were greatly limited in the presence of Az. In conclusion, Az impaired the photosynthetic performance of non-infected plants by diffusive constraints, but prevented, to a greater extent, the damage to the photosynthetic apparatus during the infection process of B. oryzae.",strobilurins among important fungicide used plant disease control worldwide addition fungicide effect strobilurins also improve crop physiology nonetheless impact azoxystrobin az main marketed strobilurin rice physiology still unknown detailed gas exchange measurement chlorophyll fluorescence analysis used examine az effect photosynthetic performance rice plant cultivar metica either challenged bipolaris oryzae causal agent brown spot az impaired carbon c fixation noninoculated plant manner related photochemical biochemical limitation rather decreased stomatal conductance limited co influx mesophyll cell photosynthesis rice plant sprayed az dramatically decreased upon b oryzae infection chiefly governed photochemical biochemical limitation energy surplus caused limited c fixation rice plant treated az inoculated b oryzae thermally effectively dissipated h inoculation az absence however mechanism sufficient prevent chronic photoinhibition photosynthesis inoculated plant able fully capture exploit collected light energy constraint greatly limited presence az conclusion az impaired photosynthetic performance noninfected plant diffusive constraint prevented greater extent damage photosynthetic apparatus infection process b oryzae,2,"{'Disease': ['important fungicide used plant disease control'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect strobilurins', 'nonetheless impact azoxystrobin az main marketed strobilurin rice physiology']}",4
24885215,Transcriptome profiling confirmed correlations between symptoms and transcriptional changes in RDV infected rice and revealed nucleolus as a possible target of RDV manipulation.,"Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is the causal agent of rice dwarf disease, which limits rice production in many areas of south East Asia. Transcriptional changes of rice in response to RDV infection have been characterized by Shimizu et al. and Satoh et al.. Both studies found induction of defense related genes and correlations between transcriptional changes and symptom development in RDV-infected rice. However, the same rice cultivar, namely Nipponbare belonging to the Japonic subspecies of rice was used in both studies. Gene expression changes of the indica subspecies of rice, namely Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica cv Yixiang2292 that show moderate resistance to RDV, in response to RDV infection were characterized using an Affymetrix Rice Genome Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were classified according to their Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. The effects of transient expression of Pns11 in Nicotiana benthaminana on the expression of nucleolar genes were studied using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). 856 genes involved in defense or other physiological processes were identified to be DEGs, most of which showed up-regulation. Ribosome- and nucleolus related genes were significantly enriched in the DEGs. Representative genes related to nucleolar function exhibited altered expression in N. benthaminana plants transiently expressing Pns11 of RDV. Induction of defense related genes is common for rice infected with RDV. There is a co-relation between symptom severity and transcriptional alteration in RDV infected rice. Besides ribosome, RDV may also target nucleolus to manipulate the translation machinery of rice. Given the tight links between nucleolus and ribosome, it is intriguing to speculate that RDV may enhance expression of ribosomal genes by targeting nucleolus through Pns11.",rice dwarf virus rdv causal agent rice dwarf disease limit rice production many area south east asia transcriptional change rice response rdv infection characterized shimizu et al satoh et al study found induction defense related gene correlation transcriptional change symptom development rdvinfected rice however rice cultivar namely nipponbare belonging japonic subspecies rice used study gene expression change indica subspecies rice namely oryza sativa l ssp indica cv yixiang show moderate resistance rdv response rdv infection characterized using affymetrix rice genome array differentially expressed gene degs classified according gene ontology go annotation effect transient expression pns nicotiana benthaminana expression nucleolar gene studied using realtime pcr rtpcr gene involved defense physiological process identified degs showed upregulation ribosome nucleolus related gene significantly enriched degs representative gene related nucleolar function exhibited altered expression n benthaminana plant transiently expressing pns rdv induction defense related gene common rice infected rdv corelation symptom severity transcriptional alteration rdv infected rice besides ribosome rdv may also target nucleolus manipulate translation machinery rice given tight link nucleolus ribosome intriguing speculate rdv may enhance expression ribosomal gene targeting nucleolus pns,3,"{'Disease': ['rice dwarf virus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['induction defense related gene correlation transcriptional change symptom development', 'pns rdv induction defense related gene common rice infected rdv corelation symptom severity transcriptional alteration rdv infected rice']}",0
23104764,Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice.,"The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants. Here, we report the importance of JA signaling in the defense system of rice. Exogenous application of JA conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA. OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner. OsJAZ8 also formed heterodimers with other OsJAZ proteins but did not form homodimer. JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the JA-dependent OsJAZ8 degradation was mediated by the Jas domain. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsJAZ8ΔC, which lacks the Jas domain, exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype. A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8ΔC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice. Furthermore, OsJAZ8ΔC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice. On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice.",plant hormone jasmonic acid ja crucial role host immunity development plant report importance ja signaling defense system rice exogenous application ja conferred resistance bacterial blight caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo rice expression osjaz rice jasmonate zimdomain protein highly upregulated ja osjaz interacted putative oscoi component scfcoi e ubiquitin ligase complex coronatinedependent manner osjaz also formed heterodimers osjaz protein form homodimer ja treatment caused osjaz degradation degradation dependent proteasome pathway furthermore jadependent osjaz degradation mediated jas domain transgenic rice plant overexpressing osjazδc lack jas domain exhibited jainsensitive phenotype largescale analysis using rice dna microarray revealed overexpression osjazδc altered expression jaresponsive gene including defenserelated gene rice furthermore osjazδc negatively regulated jainduced resistance xoo rice basis data conclude ja play important role resistance xoo osjaz act repressor ja signaling rice,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['protein form homodimer ja treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",1

26821568,A transcription activator-like effector from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola elicits dose-dependent resistance in rice.,"Xanthomonas spp. reduce crop yields and quality worldwide. During infection of their plant hosts, many strains secrete transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors, which enter the host cell nucleus and activate specific corresponding host genes at effector binding elements (EBEs) in the promoter. TAL effectors may contribute to disease by activating the expression of susceptibility genes or trigger resistance associated with the hypersensitive reaction (HR) by activating an executor resistance (R) gene. The rice bacterial leaf streak pathogen X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is known to suppress host resistance, and no host R gene has been identified against it, despite considerable effort. To further investigate Xoc suppression of host resistance, we conducted a screen of effectors from BLS256 and identified Tal2a as an HR elicitor in rice when delivered heterologously by a strain of the closely related rice bacterial blight pathogen X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) or by the soybean pathogen X. axonopodis pv. glycines. The HR required the Tal2a activation domain, suggesting an executor R gene. Tal2a activity was differentially distributed among geographically diverse Xoc isolates, being largely conserved among Asian isolates. We identified four genes induced by Tal2a in next-generation RNA sequencing experiments and confirmed them using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). However, neither individual nor collective activation of these genes by designer TAL effectors resulted in HR. A tal2a knockout mutant of BLS256 showed virulence comparable with the wild-type, but plasmid-based overexpression of tal2a at different levels in the wild-type reduced virulence in a directly corresponding way. Overall, the results reveal that host resistance suppression by Xoc plays a critical role in pathogenesis.

Here we identified a gene, <i>OsALDH2B1</i>, that functions as a master regulator of the growth-defense trade-off in rice. OsALDH2B1 has its primary function as an aldehyde dehydrogenase and a moonlight function as a transcriptional regulator. Loss of function of <i>OsALDH2B1</i> greatly enhanced resistance to broad-spectrum pathogens, including fungal blast, bacterial leaf blight, and leaf streak, but caused severe phenotypic changes such as male sterility and reduced plant size, grain size, and number. We showed that its primary function as a mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase conditions male fertility. Its moonlight function of transcriptional regulation, featuring both repressing and activating activities, regulates a diverse range of biological processes involving brassinolide, G protein, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid signaling pathways. Such regulations cause large impacts on the morphology and immunity of rice plants.

38713254,Multiomics-assisted characterization of rice-Yellow Stem Borer interaction provides genomic and mechanistic insights into stem borer resistance in rice.,"By deploying a multi-omics approach, we unraveled the mechanisms that might help rice to combat Yellow Stem Borer infestation, thus providing insights and scope for developing YSB resistant rice varieties. Yellow Stem Borer (YSB), Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is a major pest of rice, that can lead to 20-60% loss in rice production. Effective management of YSB infestation is challenged by the non-availability of adequate sources of resistance and poor understanding of resistance mechanisms, thus necessitating studies for generating resources to breed YSB resistant rice and to understand rice-YSB interaction. In this study, by using bulk-segregant analysis in combination with next-generation sequencing, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) intervals in five rice chromosomes were mapped that could be associated with YSB resistance at the vegetative phase in a resistant rice line named SM92. Further, multiple SNP markers that showed significant association with YSB resistance in rice chromosomes 1, 5, 10, and 12 were developed. RNA-sequencing of the susceptible and resistant lines revealed several genes present in the candidate QTL intervals to be differentially regulated upon YSB infestation. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed a putative candidate gene that was predicted to encode an alpha-amylase inhibitor. Analysis of the transcriptome and metabolite profiles further revealed a possible link between phenylpropanoid metabolism and YSB resistance. Taken together, our study provides deeper insights into rice-YSB interaction and enhances the understanding of YSB resistance mechanism. Importantly, a promising breeding line and markers for YSB resistance have been developed that can potentially aid in marker-assisted breeding of YSB resistance among elite rice cultivars.",deploying multiomics approach unraveled mechanism might help rice combat yellow stem borer infestation thus providing insight scope developing ysb resistant rice variety yellow stem borer ysb scirpophaga incertulas walker lepidoptera crambidae major pest rice lead loss rice production effective management ysb infestation challenged nonavailability adequate source resistance poor understanding resistance mechanism thus necessitating study generating resource breed ysb resistant rice understand riceysb interaction study using bulksegregant analysis combination nextgeneration sequencing quantitative trait locus qtl interval five rice chromosome mapped could associated ysb resistance vegetative phase resistant rice line named sm multiple snp marker showed significant association ysb resistance rice chromosome developed rnasequencing susceptible resistant line revealed several gene present candidate qtl interval differentially regulated upon ysb infestation comparative transcriptome analysis revealed putative candidate gene predicted encode alphaamylase inhibitor analysis transcriptome metabolite profile revealed possible link phenylpropanoid metabolism ysb resistance taken together study provides deeper insight riceysb interaction enhances understanding ysb resistance mechanism importantly promising breeding line marker ysb resistance developed potentially aid markerassisted breeding ysb resistance among elite rice cultivar,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['incertulas walker lepidoptera crambidae major pest rice lead loss rice production effective management ysb infestation'], 'Symptom': ['incertulas walker lepidoptera crambidae major pest rice lead loss rice production effective management ysb infestation']}",3
34618083,"Knock out of transcription factor WRKY53 thickens sclerenchyma cell walls, confers bacterial blight resistance.","Plant cell walls are the first physical barrier against pathogen invasion, and plants thicken the cell wall to strengthen it and restrain pathogen infection. Bacterial blight is a devastating rice (Oryza sativa) disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which typically enters the rice leaf through hydathodes and spreads throughout the plant via the xylem. Xoo interacts with cells surrounding the xylem vessel of a vascular bundle, but whether rice strengthens the sclerenchyma cell walls to stop pathogen proliferation is unclear. Here, we found that a WRKY protein, OsWRKY53, negatively confers resistance to Xoo by strengthening the sclerenchyma cell walls of the vascular bundle. OsMYB63 acts as a transcriptional activator and promotes the expression of three secondary cell wall-related cellulose synthase genes to boost cellulose accumulation, resulting in thickened sclerenchyma cell walls. Both OsWRKY53 and OsMYB63 are abundantly expressed in sclerenchyma cells of leaf vascular bundles. OsWRKY53 functions as a transcriptional repressor and acts genetically upstream of OsMYB63 to suppress its expression. The OsWRKY53-overexpressing and OsMYB63 knockout plants had thinner sclerenchyma cell walls, showing susceptibility to Xoo, while the OsWRKY53 knockout and OsMYB63-overexpressing plants had thicker sclerenchyma cell walls, exhibiting resistance to Xoo. These results suggest that modifying these candidate genes provides a strategy to improve rice resistance to bacterial pathogens.",plant cell wall first physical barrier pathogen invasion plant thicken cell wall strengthen restrain pathogen infection bacterial blight devastating rice oryza sativa disease caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo typically enters rice leaf hydathode spread throughout plant via xylem xoo interacts cell surrounding xylem vessel vascular bundle whether rice strengthens sclerenchyma cell wall stop pathogen proliferation unclear found wrky protein oswrky negatively confers resistance xoo strengthening sclerenchyma cell wall vascular bundle osmyb act transcriptional activator promotes expression three secondary cell wallrelated cellulose synthase gene boost cellulose accumulation resulting thickened sclerenchyma cell wall oswrky osmyb abundantly expressed sclerenchyma cell leaf vascular bundle oswrky function transcriptional repressor act genetically upstream osmyb suppress expression oswrkyoverexpressing osmyb knockout plant thinner sclerenchyma cell wall showing susceptibility xoo oswrky knockout osmyboverexpressing plant thicker sclerenchyma cell wall exhibiting resistance xoo result suggest modifying candidate gene provides strategy improve rice resistance bacterial pathogen,2,"{'Disease': ['rice oryza sativa disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
39039362,Inhibition of microelement accumulation and disorder of saccharide and amino acid metabolism explain rice grain empty under dimethylarsinic acid stress.,"Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed an intensification of energy metabolism in rice grains under DMA stress, possibly causing the consumption of sugars or non-sugars and the development of unfilled grains Excessive dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) causes rice straighthead disease, a physiological disorder typically with erect panicle due to empty grain at maturity. Although the toxicity of DMA and its uptake and transport in rice are well recognized, the underlying mechanism of unfilled grains remains unclear. Therefore, a pot experiment was conducted using a susceptible variety (Ruanhuayou1179, RHY) and a resistant one (Nanjingxiangzhan, NJXZ) via the metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches to explore the mechanisms of empty grains in diseased rice under DMA stress. The results demonstrate an increase in total and methylated As in grains of RHY and NJXZ under DMA addition, with RHY containing higher levels of DMA. DMA addition increased the soluble sugar content in grains of RHY and NJXZ by 17.1% and 14.3% compared to the control, respectively, but significantly reduced the levels of amino acid, soluble protein, and starch. The decrease of grain Zn and B contents was also observed, and inadequate Zn might be a key factor limiting rice grain yield under DMA stress. Notably, DMA addition altered the expression levels of genes involved in the transport of sugar, amino acids, nitrates/peptides, and mineral ions. In sugar and amino acid metabolism, the reduction of metabolites and the upregulated expression of genes reflect positive regulation at the level of energy metabolism, implying that the reduction of grain starch and proteins might be ascribed to generate sufficient energy to resist the stress.

The use of resistant cultivars is one of the main methods for control of nematodes. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the reaction of 36 upland-rice lines, with desirable agronomic characteristics, according to their resistance to root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita). The experimental design was entirely randomized with four replications. Each plot of land consisted of two rice plants in a 3-L vase. The plants were inoculated with 1000 eggs and eventual juveniles of the respective nematodes. Fifty-five days after the inoculation, the roots and the aerial part of the plant were weighed and the egg mass (EM) as well as the reproduction factor (Rf) were estimated. It was determined that the isolated use of EM was not beneficial in selecting rice lines resistant to the root-knot nematode. This procedure must, therefore, take into account the egg counting and the Rf, in order to improve the reliability of the selection. In our study, 30 evaluated lines were observed to be resistant.

29630984,Co-evolutionary interactions between host resistance and pathogen avirulence genes in rice-Magnaporthe oryzae pathosystem.,"Rice and Magnaporthe oryzae constitutes an ideal pathosystem for studying host-pathogen interaction in cereals crops. There are two alternative hypotheses, viz. Arms race and Trench warfare, which explain the co-evolutionary dynamics of hosts and pathogens which are under continuous confrontation. Arms race proposes that both R- and Avr- genes of host and pathogen, respectively, undergo positive selection. Alternatively, trench warfare suggests that either R- or Avr- gene in the pathosystem is under balanced selection intending to stabilize the genetic advantage gained over the opposition. Here, we made an attempt to test the above-stated hypotheses in rice-M. oryzae pathosystem at loci of three R-Avr gene pairs, Piz-t-AvrPiz-t, Pi54-AvrPi54 and Pita-AvrPita using allele mining approach. Allele mining is an efficient way to capture allelic variants existing in the population and to study the selective forces imposed on the variants during evolution. Results of nucleotide diversity, neutrality statistics and phylogenetic analyses reveal that Piz-t, Pi54 and AvrPita are diversified and under positive selection at their corresponding loci, while their counterparts, AvrPiz-t, AvrPi54 and Pita are conserved and under balancing selection, in nature. These results imply that rice-M. oryzae populations are engaged in a trench warfare at least at the three R/Avr loci studied. It is a maiden attempt to study the co-evolution of three R-Avr gene pairs in this pathosystem.

39627244,Intraspecific variability of rice root knot nematodes across diverse agroecosystems for sustainable management.,"In the rice agroecosystems of Southeast Asia, rice root knot nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) significantly impairs yield, representing a major species within the 'graminis-group' known for its morphological similarities with other root knot nematodes (RKNs). This study delves into the variations in reproductive potential, morphology, morphometrics, and genetic diversity among thirty RKN populations in rice across three distinct agroecological zones in Jharkhand, India. Despite notable differences in reproductive potential among the populations, morphological and morphometric correlations to reproductive potential were inconclusive. However, male and juvenile morphometrics were crucial for identifying intraspecific variability. Genetic analysis utilizing five molecular markers (ITS, 18 S rRNA, D2-D3 of 28 S, COX-I, and COX-II) affirmed the populations as M. graminicola, with ITS marker revealing significant intraspecific variability. Phylogenetic analysis underscored the close relationship between M. oryzae and M. graminicola, distinct from other mitotic RKN species. Low genetic distance and nucleotide diversity, coupled with high haplotype diversity, negative Tajima's D, and Fu's Fs of haplotype network analysis, suggested that all M. graminicola populations are expanding.

29391416,Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals molecular response to salinity stress of salt-tolerant and sensitive genotypes of indica rice at seedling stage.,"Abiotic stresses, such as salinity, greatly threaten the growth and productivity of plants. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important food crops, as well as a monocot model for genomic research. To obtain a global view of the molecular response to salinity stress, we conducted a leaf transcriptome analysis on rice seedlings. Two cultivars of rice subspecies indica, including the salt-tolerant genotype Xian156 and the salt-sensitive genotype IR28, were used in the present study. Eighteen RNA libraries were obtained from these two genotypes at three timepoints (0 h, 48 h and 72 h) after applying salinity stress. We obtained the reference-guided assembly of the rice transcriptome, which resulted in 1,375 novel genes, including 1,371 annotated genes. A comparative analysis between genotypes and time points showed 5,273 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 286 DEGs were only found in the tolerant genotype.

16093271,"Rice: sulfide-induced barriers to root radial oxygen loss, Fe2+ and water uptake, and lateral root emergence.","Akagare and Akiochi are diseases of rice associated with sulfide toxicity. This study investigates the possibility that rice reacts to sulfide by producing impermeable barriers in roots. Root systems of rice, Oryza sativa cv. Norin 36, were subjected to short-term exposure to 0.174 mm sulfide (5.6 ppm) in stagnant solution. Root growth was monitored; root permeability was investigated in terms of polarographic determinations of oxygen efflux from fine laterals and the apices of adventitious roots, water uptake, anatomy and permeability to Fe2+ using potassium ferricyanide. Both types of root responded rapidly to the sulfide with immediate cessation of growth, decreased radial oxygen loss (ROL) to the rhizospheres and reduced water uptake. Profiles of ROL measured from apex to basal regions of adventitious roots indicated that more intense barriers to ROL than normal were formed around the apices. Absorption of Fe2+ appeared to be impeded in sulfide-treated roots. In adventitious roots, deposition of lipid material (suberisation) and thickenings of walls within the superficial cell layers were obvious within a week after lifting the treatment and could prevent the emergence of laterals and commonly result in their upward longitudinal growth within the cortex. Death of laterals sometimes occurred prior to emergence; emergent laterals eventually died. In adventitious roots, blockages formed within the vascular and aeration systems in response to the sulfide. In both adventitious and lateral roots, sulfide-induced cell wall suberization and thickening of the superficial layers were correlated with reduced permeability to O2, water and Fe2+.

Using map-based strategy and in silico approach we isolated a new rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast resistance allele of Pid3, designated Pi25, from a stable blast resistance cultivar Gumei2. Over-expression analysis and complementation test showed that Pi25 conferred blast resistance to M. oryzae isolate js001-20. Sequence analysis showed that Pi25 was an intronless gene of 2,772 nucleotides with single nucleotide substitution in comparison to Pid3 at the nucleotide position 459 and predicatively encoded a typical coiled coil--nucleotide binding site--leucine rich repeat (CC--NBS--LRR) protein of 924 amino acid residuals with 100% identity to Pid3 putative protein.

This devastating virus causes rice plants to produce a variety of symptoms during different growth stages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a large group of 21-24-nt RNA molecules that are important regulators of plant development processes and stress responses. In this study, we used microarray profiling to investigate rice miRNAs responding to SRBSDV infection at 3, 9, 15, and 20 days post-inoculation (dpi). Expression levels of 56 miRNAs were altered in SRBSDV-infected rice plants, with these changes classified into eight different regulation patterns according to their temporal expression dynamics. Fourteen miRNAs belonging to six families (miR164, R396, R530, R1846, R1858, and R2097) were significantly regulated at 20 dpi. We used RT-qPCR to search for expression level correlations between members of these families and their putative targets at 3, 9, and 15 dpi. Some members of the miR164, R396, R530, and R1846 families were found to be positively or negatively correlated with their respective targets during 3-15 days after SRBSDV infection, whereas in more cases the rice miRNAs were not in correlation with their targets along the post-inoculation period, suggesting that some additional factors may be involved in rice miRNA-target interactions.

The genotype variation and resistant/susceptible phenotype at the Pi-ta locus of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the ancestor of cultivated rice (O. sativa), was surveyed in 36 locations worldwide to study the molecular evolution and functional adaptation of the Pi-ta gene. The low nucleotide polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene of O. rufipogon was similar to that of O. sativa, but greatly differed from what has been reported for other O. rufipogon genes. The haplotypes can be subdivided into two divergent haplogroups named H1 and H2. H1 is derived from H2, with nearly no variation and at a low frequency. H2 is common and is the ancestral form. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain has a high pi(non)/pi(syn) ratio, and the low polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene might have primarily been caused by recurrent selective sweep and constraint by other putative physiological functions. Meanwhile, we provide data to show that the amino acid Ala-918 of H1 in the LRR domain has a close relationship with the resistant phenotype.

A novel approach of evaluating plant (rice) callus suspension cultures for anticancer activity is reported. The ability of different dilutions of rice callus suspension cultures to inhibit growth of two human cancer cell lines was tested employing varying cell numbers and different incubation times. A crystal violet assay was performed to assess cell viability of the cancer cell lines. Furthermore, microscopic analysis was carried out to determine the effect of the rice callus culture on the morphology of the cancer cells. Rice callus suspension cultures significantly inhibited the growth of human cancer and renal cell lines at densities of 5000 and 10000 cells/mL when incubated for 72 and 96 h. Rice callus suspension culture was more efficient than paclitaxel (Taxol®) and etoposide in selectively killing human colon and renal cancer cell lines compared with a control cell line (human lung fibroblasts). The use of plant callus suspension cultures is a novel approach for inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, which will lead to the development of new agents for selectively killing cancer cells.",multitude natural product plant extract tested ability inhibit progression several disease including cancer novel approach evaluating plant rice callus suspension culture anticancer activity reported ability different dilution rice callus suspension culture inhibit growth two human cancer cell line tested employing varying cell number different incubation time crystal violet assay performed assess cell viability cancer cell line furthermore microscopic analysis carried determine effect rice callus culture morphology cancer cell rice callus suspension culture significantly inhibited growth human cancer renal cell line density cellsml incubated h rice callus suspension culture efficient paclitaxel taxol® etoposide selectively killing human colon renal cancer cell line compared control cell line human lung fibroblast use plant callus suspension culture novel approach inhibiting growth cancer cell lead development new agent selectively killing cancer cell,2,"{'Disease': ['several disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect rice callus culture morphology cancer cell rice callus suspension culture']}",2
17172048,Adapting rice anther culture to gene transformation and RNA interference.,"Anther culture offers a rapid method of generating homozygous lines for breeding program and genetic analysis. To produce homozygous transgenic lines of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in one step, we developed an efficient protocol of anther-callus-based transformation mediated by Agrobacterium after optimizing several factors influencing efficient transformation, including callus induction and Agrobacterium density for co-cultivation. Using this protocol, we obtained 145 independent green transformants from five cultivars of japonica rice by transformation with a binary vector pCXK1301 bearing the rice gene, Xa21 for resistance to bacterial blight, of which 140 were further confirmed by PCR and Southern hybridization analysis, including haploids (32.1%), diploids (62.1%) and mixoploids (7.5%). Fifteen diploids were found to be doubled haploids, which accounted for 10.7% of the total positive lines. Finally, by including 28 from colchicine induced or spontaneous diploidization of haploids later after transformation, a total of 43 doubled haploids (30.7%) of Xa21 transgenic lines were obtained. We also generated two RNAi transgenic haploids of the rice OsMADS2 gene, a putative redundant gene of OsMADS4 based on their sequence similarity, to investigate its possible roles in rice flower development by this method. Flowers from the two OsMADS2 RNAi transgenic haploids displayed obvious homeotic alternations, in which lodicules were transformed into palea/lemma-like tissues, whereas identities of other floral organs were maintained. The phenotypic alternations were proved to result from specific transcriptional suppression of OsMADS2 gene by the introduced RNAi transgene. The results confirmed that OsMADS2 is involved in lodicule development of rice flower and functionally redundant with OsMADS4 gene. Our results demonstrated that rice anther culture could be adapted to gene transformation and RNAi analysis in rice.",anther culture offer rapid method generating homozygous line breeding program genetic analysis produce homozygous transgenic line rice oryza sativa l one step developed efficient protocol anthercallusbased transformation mediated agrobacterium optimizing several factor influencing efficient transformation including callus induction agrobacterium density cocultivation using protocol obtained independent green transformants five cultivar japonica rice transformation binary vector pcxk bearing rice gene xa resistance bacterial blight confirmed pcr southern hybridization analysis including haploid diploid mixoploids fifteen diploid found doubled haploid accounted total positive line finally including colchicine induced spontaneous diploidization haploid later transformation total doubled haploid xa transgenic line obtained also generated two rnai transgenic haploid rice osmads gene putative redundant gene osmads based sequence similarity investigate possible role rice flower development method flower two osmads rnai transgenic haploid displayed obvious homeotic alternation lodicules transformed palealemmalike tissue whereas identity floral organ maintained phenotypic alternation proved result specific transcriptional suppression osmads gene introduced rnai transgene result confirmed osmads involved lodicule development rice flower functionally redundant osmads gene result demonstrated rice anther culture could adapted gene transformation rnai analysis rice,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['rapid method', 'possible role rice flower development method'], 'Symptom': []}",1
17115220,Molecular mapping of two cultivar-specific avirulence genes in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is a globally important disease of rice that causes annual yield losses. The segregation of genes controlling the virulence of M. grisea on rice was studied to establish the genetic basis of cultivar specificity in the interaction of rice and M. grisea. The segregation of avirulence and virulence was studied in 87 M. grisea F(1) progeny isolates from a cross of two isolates, Guy11 and JS153, using resistance-gene-differential rice cultivars. The segregation ratio indicated that avirulence and virulence in the rice cultivars Aichi-asahi and K59, respectively, are controlled by single major genes. Genetic analyses of backcrosses and full-sib crosses in these populations were also performed. The chi(2 )test of goodness-of-fitness for a 1:1 ratio indicated that one dominant gene controls avirulence in Aichi-asahi and K59 in this population. Based on the resistance reactions of rice differential lines harboring known resistance genes to the parental isolates, two genetically independent avirulence genes, AVR-Pit and AVR-Pia, were identified. Genetic linkage analysis showed that the SSR marker m355-356 is closely linked to AVR-Pit, on the telomere of chromosome 1 at a distance of approximately 2.3 cM. The RAPD marker S487, which was converted to a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker, was found to be closely linked to AVR-Pia, on the chromosome 7 telomere at a distance of 3.5 cM.

26991395,The broadly effective recessive resistance gene xa5 of rice is a virulence effector-dependent quantitative trait for bacterial blight.,"Mutations in disease susceptibility (S) genes, here referred to as recessive resistance genes, have promise for providing broad durable resistance in crop species. However, few recessive disease resistance genes have been characterized. Here, we show that the broadly effective resistance gene xa5,for resistance to bacterial blight of rice (Oryza sativa), is dependent on the effector genes present in the pathogen. Specifically, the effectiveness of xa5 in preventing disease by strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is dependent on major transcription activation-like (TAL) effector genes, and correlates with reduced expression of the cognate S genes. xa5 is ineffective in preventing disease by strains containing the TAL effector gene pthXo1, which directs robust expression of the S gene OsSWEET11, a member of sucrose transporter gene family. Incompatibility is associated with major TAL effectors that target the known alternative S genes OsSWEET14 and OsSWEET13. Incompatibility is defeated by transfer of pthXo1 to otherwise xa5-incompatible strains or by engineering a synthetic designer TAL effector to boost SWEET gene expression. In either case, compatible or incompatible, target gene expression and lesion formation are reduced in the presence of xa5. The results indicate that xa5 functions as a quantitative trait locus, dampening effector function, and, regardless of compatibility, target gene expression. Resistance is hypothesized to occur when S gene expression, and, by inference, sucrose leakage, falls below a threshold level.",mutation disease susceptibility gene referred recessive resistance gene promise providing broad durable resistance crop specie however recessive disease resistance gene characterized show broadly effective resistance gene xafor resistance bacterial blight rice oryza sativa dependent effector gene present pathogen specifically effectiveness xa preventing disease strain xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae dependent major transcription activationlike tal effector gene correlate reduced expression cognate gene xa ineffective preventing disease strain containing tal effector gene pthxo directs robust expression gene ossweet member sucrose transporter gene family incompatibility associated major tal effector target known alternative gene ossweet ossweet incompatibility defeated transfer pthxo otherwise xaincompatible strain engineering synthetic designer tal effector boost sweet gene expression either case compatible incompatible target gene expression lesion formation reduced presence xa result indicate xa function quantitative trait locus dampening effector function regardless compatibility target gene expression resistance hypothesized occur gene expression inference sucrose leakage fall threshold level,4,"{'Disease': ['mutation disease susceptibility gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['broadly effective resistance gene xafor resistance bacterial blight rice oryza sativa dependent effector gene present pathogen', 'tal effector gene', 'tal effector gene pthxo', 'major tal effector target known alternative gene ossweet ossweet incompatibility', 'tal effector', 'xa function quantitative trait locus dampening effector function']}",1
38462083,Carbon nanosol promotes plant growth and broad-spectrum resistance.,"Carbon nanosol (CNS) is a carbon-based nanomaterial capable of promoting plant growth while the underlying mechanism involved in this process remains unknown. This study demonstrates that CNS promotes rice seedling growth under restricted concentrations. Macroelement transporter mutants were investigated to further investigate the CNS-mediated promotion of rice seedling growth. The genetic and physiological findings revealed that nitrate transporter 1.1B (NRT1.1B) and ammonium transporter 1 (AMT1) mutants inhibited the CNS-induced growth development of rice seedlings, whereas potassium transporter (AKT1) and phosphate transporter 8 (PT8) did not exhibit any inhibitory effects. Further investigations demonstrated the inhibition of CNS-mediated growth promotion via glutamine synthetase 1;1 (gs1;1) mutants. Additionally, the administration of CNS resulted in enhanced accumulation of chlorophyll in plants, and the promotion of CNS-induced growth was inhibited by yellow-green leaf 8 (YGL8) mutants and the chlorophyll biosynthetic gene divinyl reductase (DVR) mutants. According to these findings, the CNS promotes plant growth by stimulating chlorophyll biosynthesis. Furthermore, the presence of CNS enhanced the ability of rice to withstand blast, sheath blight (ShB), and bacterial blight. The nrt1.1b, amt1, dvr, and ygl8 mutants did not exhibit a broad spectrum effect. The positive regulation of broad-spectrum resistance in rice by GS1;1 suggests the requirement of N assimilation for CNS-mediated broad-spectrum resistance. In addition, an in vitro assay demonstrated that CNS inhibits the growth of pathogens responsible for blast, ShB, and bacterial blight, namely Magnaporthe oryzae, Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae, respectively. CNS application may also induce broad-spectrum resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens, indicating that in addition to its antifungal and antibacterial properties, CNS application may also stimulate N assimilation.

39341852,A time-course transcriptomic analysis reveals the key responses of a resistant rice cultivar to brown planthopper infestation.,"The brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the most problematic pests affecting rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields in Asia. Breeding rice varieties containing resistance genes is the most economical and effective means of controlling BPH. In this study, the key factors in resistance to BPH were investigated between the high-resistance rice variety ""R26"" and the susceptible variety ""TN1"" using RNA-sequencing. We identified 9527 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the rice varieties under BPH-induced stress. Weighted time-course gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that the increased expression of genes is associated with plant hormones, MAPK signaling pathway and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, which were involved in disease resistance. A connection network identified a hub gene, OsREM4.1 (BGIOSGA024059), that may affect rice resistance to the BPH. Knocking out OsREM4.1 in rice can lead to a decrease in callose, making it less resistant to BPH. Overall, the expression of differentially expressed genes varies among rice varieties with different resistance in BPH invasion. Inaddition, R26 enhances resistance to BPH by upregulating genes and secondary metabolites related to stress resistance and plant immunity. In summary, our study provides valuable insights into the genome-wide expression profile of DEGs in rice under BPH invasion through high-throughput sequencing, and further suggests that R26 can be used to develop high resistance rice lines in BPH resistant breeding programs.",brown planthopper bph one problematic pest affecting rice oryza sativa l yield asia breeding rice variety containing resistance gene economical effective mean controlling bph study key factor resistance bph investigated highresistance rice variety r susceptible variety tn using rnasequencing identified differentially expressed gene degs rice variety bphinduced stress weighted timecourse gene coexpression network analysis wgcna indicated increased expression gene associated plant hormone mapk signaling pathway biosynthesis secondary metabolite involved disease resistance connection network identified hub gene osrem bgiosga may affect rice resistance bph knocking osrem rice lead decrease callose making less resistant bph overall expression differentially expressed gene varies among rice variety different resistance bph invasion inaddition r enhances resistance bph upregulating gene secondary metabolite related stress resistance plant immunity summary study provides valuable insight genomewide expression profile degs rice bph invasion highthroughput sequencing suggests r used develop high resistance rice line bph resistant breeding program,0,"{'Disease': ['secondary metabolite involved disease resistance connection network'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
30222251,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.","Plants have evolved many receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) to modulate their growth, development, and innate immunity. Broad-Spectrum Resistance 1 (BSR1) encodes a rice RLCK, whose overexpression confers resistance to multiple diseases, including fungal rice blast and bacterial leaf blight. However, the mechanisms underlying resistance remain largely unknown. In the present study, we report that BSR1 is a functional protein kinase that autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates an artificial substrate in vitro. Although BSR1 is classified as a serine/threonine kinase, it was shown to autophosphorylate on tyrosine as well as on serine/threonine residues when expressed in bacteria, demonstrating that it is a dual-specificity kinase. Protein kinase activity was found to be indispensable for resistance to rice blast and leaf blight in BSR1-overexpressing plants. Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of BSR1 was critical for proper localization of BSR1 in rice cells and played a crucial role in BSR1-mediated resistance to multiple diseases, as evidenced by compromised disease resistance in transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant BSR1 in which Tyr-63 was substituted with Ala. Overall, our data indicate that BSR1 is a non-receptor dual-specificity kinase and that both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activities are critical for the normal functioning of BSR1 in the resistance to multiple pathogens. Our results support the notion that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a major regulatory role in the transduction of defense signals from cell-surface receptor complexes to downstream signaling components in plants.",plant evolved many receptorlike cytoplasmic kinase rlcks modulate growth development innate immunity broadspectrum resistance bsr encodes rice rlck whose overexpression confers resistance multiple disease including fungal rice blast bacterial leaf blight however mechanism underlying resistance remain largely unknown present study report bsr functional protein kinase autophosphorylates transphosphorylates artificial substrate vitro although bsr classified serinethreonine kinase shown autophosphorylate tyrosine well serinethreonine residue expressed bacteria demonstrating dualspecificity kinase protein kinase activity found indispensable resistance rice blast leaf blight bsroverexpressing plant importantly tyrosine phosphorylation bsr critical proper localization bsr rice cell played crucial role bsrmediated resistance multiple disease evidenced compromised disease resistance transgenic plant overexpressing mutant bsr tyr substituted ala overall data indicate bsr nonreceptor dualspecificity kinase tyrosine serinethreonine kinase activity critical normal functioning bsr resistance multiple pathogen result support notion tyrosine phosphorylation play major regulatory role transduction defense signal cellsurface receptor complex downstream signaling component plant,4,"{'Disease': ['resistance multiple disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
21930802,Ortholog alleles at Xa3/Xa26 locus confer conserved race-specific resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae in rice.,"The rice disease resistance (R) gene Xa3/Xa26 (having also been named Xa3 and Xa26) against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacterial blight disease, belongs to a multiple gene family clustered in chromosome 11 and is from an AA genome rice cultivar (Oryza sativa L.). This family encodes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type proteins. Here, we show that the orthologs (alleles) of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3, from wild Oryza species O. officinalis (CC genome) and O. minuta (BBCC genome), respectively, were also R genes against Xoo. Xa3/Xa26-2 and Xa3/Xa26-3 conferred resistance to 16 of the 18 Xoo strains examined. Comparative sequence analysis of the Xa3/Xa26 families in the two wild Oryza species showed that Xa3/Xa26-3 appeared to have originated from the CC genome of O. minuta. The predicted proteins encoded by Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, and Xa3/Xa26-3 share 91-99% sequence identity and 94-99% sequence similarity. Transgenic plants carrying a single copy of Xa3/Xa26, Xa3/Xa26-2, or Xa3/Xa26-3, in the same genetic background, showed a similar resistance spectrum to a set of Xoo strains, although plants carrying Xa3/Xa26-2 or Xa3/Xa26-3 showed lower resistance levels than the plants carrying Xa3/Xa26. These results suggest that the Xa3/Xa26 locus predates the speciation of A and C genome, which is approximately 7.5 million years ago. Thus, the resistance specificity of this locus has been conserved for a long time.",rice disease resistance r gene xaxa also named xa xa xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo cause bacterial blight disease belongs multiple gene family clustered chromosome aa genome rice cultivar oryza sativa l family encodes leucinerich repeat lrr receptor kinasetype protein show orthologs allele xaxa xaxa xaxa wild oryza specie officinalis cc genome minuta bbcc genome respectively also r gene xoo xaxa xaxa conferred resistance xoo strain examined comparative sequence analysis xaxa family two wild oryza specie showed xaxa appeared originated cc genome minuta predicted protein encoded xaxa xaxa xaxa share sequence identity sequence similarity transgenic plant carrying single copy xaxa xaxa xaxa genetic background showed similar resistance spectrum set xoo strain although plant carrying xaxa xaxa showed lower resistance level plant carrying xaxa result suggest xaxa locus predates speciation c genome approximately million year ago thus resistance specificity locus conserved long time,4,"{'Disease': ['rice disease resistance r gene xaxa', 'bacterial blight disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

Real-time PCR was used to explore the differential expression of eight blast resistance genes among the ten local varieties.

39244093,"Synergy between virus and three kingdom pathogens, fungus, bacterium and virus is lost in rice mutant lines of OsRDR1/6.","Co-infection, caused by multiple pathogen attacks on an organism, can lead to disease development or immunity. This complex interaction can be synergetic, co-existing, or antagonistic, ultimately influencing disease severity. The interaction between fungus, bacterium, and virus (three kingdom pathogens) is most prevalent. However, the underlying mechanisms of co-infection need to be explored further. In this study, we investigated the co-infection phenomenon in rice plants exposed to multiple pathogen species, specifically Rice necrosis mosaic virus (RNMV) and rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae, MO), bacterial leaf blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, XO) or Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Our research showed that RNMV interacts synergistically with MO, XO, or CMV, increasing pathogen growth and lesion size.

26030358,Combination Patterns of Major R Genes Determine the Level of Resistance to the M. oryzae in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating disease of rice and poses a serious threat to world food security. In this study, the distribution and effectiveness of 18 R genes in 277 accessions were investigated based on pathogenicity assays and molecular markers. The results showed that most of the accessions exhibited some degree of resistance (resistance frequency, RF >50%). Accordingly, most of the accessions were observed to harbor two or more R genes, and the number of R genes harbored in accessions was significantly positively correlated with RF. Some R genes were demonstrated to be specifically distributed in the genomes of rice sub-species, such as Pigm, Pi9, Pi5 and Pi1, which were only detected in indica-type accessions, and Pik and Piz, which were just harbored in japonica-type accessions. By analyzing the relationship between R genes and RF using a multiple stepwise regression model, the R genes Pid3, Pi5, Pi9, Pi54, Pigm and Pit were found to show the main effects against M. oryzae in indica-type accessions, while Pita, Pb1, Pik, Pizt and Pia were indicated to exhibit the main effects against M. oryzae in japonica-type accessions. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis revealed that combination patterns of major R genes were the main factors determining the resistance of rice varieties to M. oryzae, such as 'Pi9+Pi54', 'Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pi54+Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pid3' and 'Pi5+Pit+Pid3' in indica-type accessions and 'Pik+Pib', 'Pik+Pita', 'Pik+Pb1', 'Pizt+Pia' and 'Pizt+Pita' in japonica-type accessions, which were able to confer effective resistance against M. oryzae.

19161601,Differential effectiveness of Serratia plymuthica IC1270-induced systemic resistance against hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic leaf pathogens in rice.,"Induced resistance is a state of enhanced defensive capacity developed by a plant reacting to specific biotic or chemical stimuli. Over the years, several forms of induced resistance have been characterized, including systemic acquired resistance, which is induced upon localized infection by an avirulent necrotizing pathogen, and induced systemic resistance (ISR), which is elicited by selected strains of nonpathogenic rhizobacteria. However, contrary to the relative wealth of information on inducible defense responses in dicotyledoneous plants, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying induced resistance phenomena in cereal crops is still in its infancy. Using a combined cytomolecular and pharmacological approach, we analyzed the host defense mechanisms associated with the establishment of ISR in rice by the rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica IC1270. In a standardized soil-based assay, root treatment with IC1270 rendered foliar tissues more resistant to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, causal agent of the devastating rice blast disease. Analysis of the cytological and biochemical alterations associated with restriction of fungal growth in IC1270-induced plants revealed that IC1270 primes rice for enhanced attacker-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescent phenolic compounds in and near epidermal cells displaying dense cytoplasmic granulation. Similar, yet more abundant, phenotypes of hypersensitively dying cells in the vicinity of fungal hyphae were evident in a gene-for-gene interaction with an avirulent M. oryzae strain, suggesting that IC1270-inducible ISR and R protein conditioned effector-triggered immunity (ETI) target similar defense mechanisms. Yet, this IC1270-inducible ISR response seems to act as a double-edged sword within the rice defense network as induced plants displayed an increased vulnerability to the necrotrophic pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Cochliobolus miyabeanus. Artificial enhancement of ROS levels in inoculated leaves faithfully mimicked the opposite effects of IC1270 bacteria on aforementioned pathogens, suggesting a central role for oxidative events in the IC1270-induced resistance mechanism. Besides identifying ROS as modulators of antagonistic defense mechanisms in rice, this work reveals the mechanistic similarities between S. plymuthica-mediated ISR and R protein-dictated ETI and underscores the importance of using appropriate innate defense mechanisms when breeding for broad-spectrum rice disease resistance.",induced resistance state enhanced defensive capacity developed plant reacting specific biotic chemical stimulus year several form induced resistance characterized including systemic acquired resistance induced upon localized infection avirulent necrotizing pathogen induced systemic resistance isr elicited selected strain nonpathogenic rhizobacteria however contrary relative wealth information inducible defense response dicotyledoneous plant understanding molecular mechanism underlying induced resistance phenomenon cereal crop still infancy using combined cytomolecular pharmacological approach analyzed host defense mechanism associated establishment isr rice rhizobacterium serratia plymuthica ic standardized soilbased assay root treatment ic rendered foliar tissue resistant hemibiotrophic pathogen magnaporthe oryzae causal agent devastating rice blast disease analysis cytological biochemical alteration associated restriction fungal growth icinduced plant revealed ic prime rice enhanced attackerinduced accumulation reactive oxygen specie ro autofluorescent phenolic compound near epidermal cell displaying dense cytoplasmic granulation similar yet abundant phenotype hypersensitively dying cell vicinity fungal hypha evident geneforgene interaction avirulent oryzae strain suggesting icinducible isr r protein conditioned effectortriggered immunity eti target similar defense mechanism yet icinducible isr response seems act doubleedged sword within rice defense network induced plant displayed increased vulnerability necrotrophic pathogen rhizoctonia solani cochliobolus miyabeanus artificial enhancement ro level inoculated leaf faithfully mimicked opposite effect ic bacteria aforementioned pathogen suggesting central role oxidative event icinduced resistance mechanism besides identifying ro modulators antagonistic defense mechanism rice work reveals mechanistic similarity plymuthicamediated isr r proteindictated eti underscore importance using appropriate innate defense mechanism breeding broadspectrum rice disease resistance,2,"{'Disease': ['devastating rice blast disease analysis cytological biochemical alteration associated restriction fungal growth icinduced plant', 'broadspectrum rice disease resistance'], 'Treatment': ['assay root treatment'], 'Symptom': ['opposite effect']}",3
31297040,Mapping and characterization of a quantitative trait locus resistance to the brown planthopper in the rice variety IR64.,"Rice planthoppers (main brown planthopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> Stål; BPH) was one of substantial threats to Asia rice production as its serious destruction and difficulties in control under field conditions. Notably, host-plant resistance was proved to be one of the effective ways to manage the pest. And stronger virulence will probably emergence when continuous use of insecticides. Therefore, more resistance genes with different resistance mechanisms were needed to be detected and then applied in the rice breeding practice. Resistance genes in the rice variety IR64 were evaluated considering the seedling bulk test and seedling survival rate. As a result, a locus with a large LOD score of 7.23 was found between markers RM302 and YM35 on chromosome 1. The locus explained 36.9% of phenotypic variation and was tentatively denominated <i>Bph37</i>. Moreover, <i>Bph1</i> was detected to be harbored by the markers RM28366 and RM463, and had the largest LOD score of 2.08, explaining 7.7% of phenotypic variance in the same mapping population. Finally, the preliminary-near-isogenic-lines (pre-NILs) carrying <i>Bph37</i> exhibited significant tolerance to the insects. But no antibiotic or antixenotic effects were observed in the resistant plants when infested with the insects. We mapped one major BPH resistance gene <i>Bph37</i> in consideration of seedling survival rate and the resistance lines showed tolerance to BPH.

29771278,A Pelota-like gene regulates root development and defence responses in rice.,"Pelota (Pelo) are evolutionarily conserved genes reported to be involved in ribosome rescue, cell cycle control and meiotic cell division. However, there is little known about their function in plants. The aim of this study was to elucidate the function of an ethylmethane sulphonate (EMS)-derived mutation of a Pelo-like gene in rice (named Ospelo). A dysfunctional mutant was used to characterize the function of OsPelo. Analyses of its expression and sub-cellular localization were performed. The whole-genome transcriptomic change in leaves of Ospelo was also investigated by RNA sequencing. The Ospelo mutant showed defects in root system development and spotted leaves at early seedling stages. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in the putative Pelo gene. OsPelo was found to be expressed in various tissues throughout the plant, and the protein was located in mitochondria. Defence responses were induced in the Ospelo mutant, as shown by enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, coupled with upregulation of three pathogenesis-related marker genes. In addition, whole-genome transcriptome analysis showed that OsPelo was significantly associated with a number of biological processes, including translation, metabolism and biotic stress response. Detailed analysis showed that activation of a number of innate immunity-related genes might be responsible for the enhanced disease resistance in the Ospelo mutant. These results demonstrate that OsPelo positively regulates root development while its loss of function enhances pathogen resistance by pre-activation of defence responses in rice.",pelota pelo evolutionarily conserved gene reported involved ribosome rescue cell cycle control meiotic cell division however little known function plant aim study elucidate function ethylmethane sulphonate emsderived mutation pelolike gene rice named ospelo dysfunctional mutant used characterize function ospelo analysis expression subcellular localization performed wholegenome transcriptomic change leaf ospelo also investigated rna sequencing ospelo mutant showed defect root system development spotted leaf early seedling stage mapbased cloning revealed mutation occurred putative pelo gene ospelo found expressed various tissue throughout plant protein located mitochondrion defence response induced ospelo mutant shown enhanced resistance bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae coupled upregulation three pathogenesisrelated marker gene addition wholegenome transcriptome analysis showed ospelo significantly associated number biological process including translation metabolism biotic stress response detailed analysis showed activation number innate immunityrelated gene might responsible enhanced disease resistance ospelo mutant result demonstrate ospelo positively regulates root development loss function enhances pathogen resistance preactivation defence response rice,3,"{'Disease': ['responsible enhanced disease resistance ospelo mutant result'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
30676922,Genotype by Environment Interaction: The Greatest Obstacle in Precise Determination of Rice Sheath Blight Resistance in the Field.,"Rice sheath blight (SB) is the most serious rice disease in China. Resistance of rice to SB is a quantitative trait that is easily influenced by the environment; however, the extent of environmental influence on SB field resistance is still poorly understood. To identify rice genotype by environment interactions for SB resistance, 211 rice genotypes originating from 15 countries were planted and evaluated for SB field resistance in six different environments between 2012 and 2016 after inoculation with the SB pathogen isolate ZJ03. In addition, 65 rice genotypes were evaluated for SB field resistance in another four environments between 2013 and 2016 using ZJ03. Variations in SB field resistance were observed in different genotypes in different environments using objective and subjective rating methods. Two-way analysis of variance indicated that the interaction between the genotype and environment had a highly significant effect on SB field resistance. This analysis indicated that the environment had more of an influence than the genotype itself on SB field resistance, and the genotype by environment interaction was the greatest obstacle in obtaining a precise determination of SB field resistance in rice. The most resistant genotype, GD66, is a good candidate for genetic studies and breeding.",rice sheath blight sb serious rice disease china resistance rice sb quantitative trait easily influenced environment however extent environmental influence sb field resistance still poorly understood identify rice genotype environment interaction sb resistance rice genotype originating country planted evaluated sb field resistance six different environment inoculation sb pathogen isolate zj addition rice genotype evaluated sb field resistance another four environment using zj variation sb field resistance observed different genotype different environment using objective subjective rating method twoway analysis variance indicated interaction genotype environment highly significant effect sb field resistance analysis indicated environment influence genotype sb field resistance genotype environment interaction greatest obstacle obtaining precise determination sb field resistance rice resistant genotype gd good candidate genetic study breeding,2,"{'Disease': ['serious rice disease'], 'Treatment': ['objective subjective rating method twoway analysis variance'], 'Symptom': ['highly significant effect']}",0

The role and function of the OsGADD45a2 in DNA demethylation are not well-understood and were investigated in this study. <i>Osgadd45a2</i> mutants exhibited reduced height, shorter panicle length, fewer grains per panicle, and a lower seed setting rate compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the results showed that <i>OsGADD45a2</i> negatively regulates rice blast fungus resistance and exhibited high expression in various tissues. Using the 3000 Rice Genomes Project database, we identified four major haplotypes (each with over 100 cultivars) based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding sequence of <i>OsGADD45a2</i>. Among these, Hap4 was associated with a significantly greater plant height than Hap1-3, possibly due to a functional alteration of <i>OsGADD45a2</i> linked to the SNP at position 2614993. In <i>OsGADD45a2</i> overexpression lines, significant decreases in CG and CHG methylation levels were observed in protein-coding genes, leading to their upregulation.

25547964,Cytological and molecular analysis of nonhost resistance in rice to wheat powdery mildew and leaf rust pathogens.,"Cereal powdery mildews caused by Blumeria graminis and cereal rusts caused by Puccinia spp. are constant disease threats that limit the production of almost all important cereal crops. Rice is an intensively grown agricultural cereal that is atypical because of its immunity to all powdery mildew and rust fungi. We analyzed the nonhost interactions between rice and the wheat powdery mildew fungus B. graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) and the wheat leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina (Ptr) to identify the basis of nonhost resistance (NHR) in rice against cereal powdery mildew and rust fungi at cytological and molecular levels. No visible symptoms were observed on rice leaves inoculated with Bgt or Ptr. Microscopic observations showed that both pathogens exhibited aberrant differentiation and significantly reduced penetration frequencies on rice compared to wheat. The development of Bgt and Ptr was also completely arrested at early infection stages in cases of successful penetration into rice leaves. Attempted infection of rice by Bgt and Ptr induced similar defense responses, including callose deposition, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and hypersensitive response in rice epidermal and mesophyll cells, respectively. Furthermore, a set of defense-related genes were upregulated in rice against Bgt and Ptr infection. Rice is an excellent monocot model for genetic and molecular studies. Therefore, our results demonstrate that rice is a useful model to study the mechanisms of NHR to cereal powdery mildew and rust fungi, which provides useful information for the development of novel and durable strategies to control these important pathogens.",cereal powdery mildew caused blumeria graminis cereal rust caused puccinia spp constant disease threat limit production almost important cereal crop rice intensively grown agricultural cereal atypical immunity powdery mildew rust fungi analyzed nonhost interaction rice wheat powdery mildew fungus b graminis f sp tritici bgt wheat leaf rust fungus puccinia triticina ptr identify basis nonhost resistance nhr rice cereal powdery mildew rust fungi cytological molecular level visible symptom observed rice leaf inoculated bgt ptr microscopic observation showed pathogen exhibited aberrant differentiation significantly reduced penetration frequency rice compared wheat development bgt ptr also completely arrested early infection stage case successful penetration rice leaf attempted infection rice bgt ptr induced similar defense response including callose deposition accumulation reactive oxygen specie hypersensitive response rice epidermal mesophyll cell respectively furthermore set defenserelated gene upregulated rice bgt ptr infection rice excellent monocot model genetic molecular study therefore result demonstrate rice useful model study mechanism nhr cereal powdery mildew rust fungi provides useful information development novel durable strategy control important pathogen,2,"{'Disease': ['puccinia spp constant disease threat limit production', 'nonhost interaction rice wheat powdery mildew fungus b graminis f sp tritici bgt wheat leaf rust fungus puccinia triticina ptr'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
15980201,Vitamin B1 functions as an activator of plant disease resistance.,"Vitamin B(1) (thiamine) is an essential nutrient for humans. Vitamin B(1) deficiency causes beriberi, which disturbs the central nervous and circulatory systems. In countries in which rice (Oryza sativa) is a major food, thiamine deficiency is prevalent because polishing of rice removes most of the thiamine in the grain. We demonstrate here that thiamine, in addition to its nutritional value, induces systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants. Thiamine-treated rice, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and vegetable crop plants showed resistance to fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. Thiamine treatment induces the transient expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in rice and other plants. In addition, thiamine treatment potentiates stronger and more rapid PR gene expression and the up-regulation of protein kinase C activity. The effects of thiamine on disease resistance and defense-related gene expression mobilize systemically throughout the plant and last for more than 15 d after treatment. Treatment of Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia-0 plants with thiamine resulted in the activation of PR-1 but not PDF1.2. Furthermore, thiamine prevented bacterial infection in Arabidopsis mutants insensitive to jasmonic acid or ethylene but not in mutants impaired in the SAR transduction pathway. These results clearly demonstrate that thiamine induces SAR in plants through the salicylic acid and Ca(2+)-related signaling pathways.

The objective of this study was to assess the leaf blast-suppressing effects of rice phylloplane fungi. One Cladosporium sp. phylloplane fungus was shown to possess biocontrolling traits based on its morphological characteristics and an analysis of its 18S ribosomal DNA. Experiments aimed at determining the optimal time to apply the bioagent and the mechanisms involved in its rice blast-suppressing activities were performed under controlled greenhouse conditions. We used foliar spraying to apply the Cladosporium sp. 48 h prior to applying the pathogen, and we found that this increased the enzymatic activity. Furthermore, in vitro tests performed using isolate C24 showed that it possessed the ability to secrete endoxylanases and endoglucanases. When Cladosporium sp. was applied either prior to or simultaneous with the pathogen, we observed a significant increase in defence enzyme activity, and rice blast was suppressed by 84.0 and 78.6 %, respectively. However, some enzymes showed higher activity at 24 h while others did so at 48 h after the challenge inoculation. Cladosporium sp. is a biological agent that is capable of suppressing rice leaf blast by activating biochemical defence mechanisms in rice plants.

Here, we show that the japonica landrace Yangmaogu (YMG) displays a broader spectrum of resistance to blast isolates than other previously reported broad-spectrum resistant (BSR) cultivars. Genetic analysis suggested that YMG contains at least three major R genes.

Two open reading frames (NBS-1 and NBS-2) encoding nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins were short-listed as candidate genes for Pi64. Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into three susceptible japonica cultivars. Only transformants with NBS-2 conferred resistance to leaf and neck blast, validating the idea that NBS-2 represents the functional Pi64 gene. Pi64 is constitutively expressed at all development stages and in all tissues examined. Pi64 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.

28990483,Identification of a Hypervirulent Pathotype of Rice yellow mottle virus: A Threat to Genetic Resistance Deployment in West-Central Africa.,"Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) causes high losses to rice production in Africa. Several sources of varietal high resistance are available but the emergence of virulent pathotypes that are able to overcome one or two resistance alleles can sometimes occur. Both resistance spectra and viral adaptability have to be taken into account to develop sustainable rice breeding strategies against RYMV. In this study, we extended previous resistance spectrum analyses by testing the rymv1-4 and rymv1-5 alleles that are carried by the rice accessions Tog5438 and Tog5674, respectively, against isolates that are representative of RYMV genetic and pathogenic diversity. Our study revealed a hypervirulent pathotype, named thereafter pathotype T', that is able to overcome all known sources of high resistance. This pathotype, which is spatially localized in West-Central Africa, appears to be more abundant than previously suspected. To better understand the adaptive processes of pathotype T', molecular determinants of resistance breakdown were identified via Sanger sequencing and validated through directed mutagenesis of an infectious clone. These analyses confirmed the key role of convergent nonsynonymous substitutions in the central part of the viral genome-linked protein to overcome RYMV1-mediated resistance. In addition, deep-sequencing analyses revealed that resistance breakdown does not always coincide with fixed mutations. Actually, virulence mutations that are present in a small proportion of the virus population can be sufficient for resistance breakdown. Considering the spatial distribution of RYMV strains in Africa and their ability to overcome the RYMV resistance genes and alleles, we established a resistance-breaking risk map to optimize strategies for the deployment of sustainable and resistant rice lines in Africa.",rice yellow mottle virus rymv cause high loss rice production africa several source varietal high resistance available emergence virulent pathotypes able overcome one two resistance allele sometimes occur resistance spectrum viral adaptability taken account develop sustainable rice breeding strategy rymv study extended previous resistance spectrum analysis testing rymv rymv allele carried rice accession tog tog respectively isolates representative rymv genetic pathogenic diversity study revealed hypervirulent pathotype named thereafter pathotype able overcome known source high resistance pathotype spatially localized westcentral africa appears abundant previously suspected better understand adaptive process pathotype molecular determinant resistance breakdown identified via sanger sequencing validated directed mutagenesis infectious clone analysis confirmed key role convergent nonsynonymous substitution central part viral genomelinked protein overcome rymvmediated resistance addition deepsequencing analysis revealed resistance breakdown always coincide fixed mutation actually virulence mutation present small proportion virus population sufficient resistance breakdown considering spatial distribution rymv strain africa ability overcome rymv resistance gene allele established resistancebreaking risk map optimize strategy deployment sustainable resistant rice line africa,0,"{'Disease': ['rice yellow mottle virus rymv', 'present small proportion virus population sufficient resistance breakdown'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3

In this study, we found that overexpression of RGSV P1, a specific viral protein encoded by viral RNA1, results in enhanced sensitivity to low K<sup>+</sup> stress and exhibits a significantly lower rate of K<sup>+</sup> influx compared to wild-type rice plants. Further investigation revealed that RGSV P1 interacts with OsCIPK23, an upstream regulator of Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel OsAKT1. Moreover, we found that the P1 protein recruits the OsCIPK23 to the Cajal bodies (CBs). In vivo assays demonstrated that the P1 protein competitively binds to OsCIPK23 with both OsCBL1 and OsAKT1. In the nucleus, the P1 protein enhances the binding of OsCIPK23 to OsCoilin, a homologue of the signature protein of CBs in Arabidopsis, and facilitates their trafficking through these CB structures. Genetic analysis indicates that mutant in oscipk23 suppresses RGSV systemic infection. Conversely, osakt1 mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to RGSV infection. These findings suggest that RGSV P1 hinders the absorption of K<sup>+</sup> in rice plants by recruiting the OsCIPK23 to the CB structures. This process potentially promotes virus systemic infection but comes at the expense of inhibiting OsAKT1 activity.",potassium ksupsup play crucial role macronutrient growth development plant study definitely determined vital role ksupsup response pathogen invasion previous investigation revealed rice plant infected rice grassy stunt virus rgsv displayed reduction ksupsup content mechanism rgsv infection subverts ksupsup uptake remains unknown study found overexpression rgsv p specific viral protein encoded viral rna result enhanced sensitivity low ksupsup stress exhibit significantly lower rate ksupsup influx compared wildtype rice plant investigation revealed rgsv p interacts oscipk upstream regulator shaker ksupsup channel osakt moreover found p protein recruit oscipk cajal body cbs vivo assay demonstrated p protein competitively bind oscipk oscbl osakt nucleus p protein enhances binding oscipk oscoilin homologue signature protein cbs arabidopsis facilitates trafficking cb structure genetic analysis indicates mutant oscipk suppresses rgsv systemic infection conversely osakt mutant exhibited increased sensitivity rgsv infection finding suggest rgsv p hinders absorption ksupsup rice plant recruiting oscipk cb structure process potentially promotes virus systemic infection come expense inhibiting osakt activity,3,"{'Disease': ['rice grassy stunt virus rgsv', 'virus systemic infection'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
22150231,Genetic evidence for natural product-mediated plant-plant allelopathy in rice (Oryza sativa).,"• There is controversy as to whether specific natural products play a role in directly mediating antagonistic plant-plant interactions - that is, allelopathy. If proved to exist, such phenomena would hold considerable promise for agronomic improvement of staple food crops such as rice (Oryza sativa). • However, while substantiated by the presence of phytotoxic compounds at potentially relevant concentrations, demonstrating a direct role for specific natural products in allelopathy has been difficult because of the chemical complexity of root and plant litter exudates. This complexity can be bypassed via selective genetic manipulation to ablate production of putative allelopathic compounds, but such an approach previously has not been applied. • The rice diterpenoid momilactones provide an example of natural products for which correlative biochemical evidence has been obtained for a role in allelopathy. Here, we apply reverse genetics, using knock-outs of the relevant diterpene synthases (copalyl diphosphate synthase 4 (OsCPS4) and kaurene synthase-like 4 (OsKSL4)), to demonstrate that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy, including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli). • Thus, our results not only provide novel genetic evidence for natural product-mediated allelopathy, but also furnish a molecular target for breeding and metabolic engineering of this important crop plant.",• controversy whether specific natural product play role directly mediating antagonistic plantplant interaction allelopathy proved exist phenomenon would hold considerable promise agronomic improvement staple food crop rice oryza sativa • however substantiated presence phytotoxic compound potentially relevant concentration demonstrating direct role specific natural product allelopathy difficult chemical complexity root plant litter exudate complexity bypassed via selective genetic manipulation ablate production putative allelopathic compound approach previously applied • rice diterpenoid momilactones provide example natural product correlative biochemical evidence obtained role allelopathy apply reverse genetics using knockout relevant diterpene synthases copalyl diphosphate synthase oscps kaurene synthaselike osksl demonstrate rice momilactones involved allelopathy including suppressing growth widespread rice paddy weed barnyard grass echinochloa crusgalli • thus result provide novel genetic evidence natural productmediated allelopathy also furnish molecular target breeding metabolic engineering important crop plant,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0

To evaluate possible risks associated with pollen-mediated transgene dispersal, we conducted a two-year survey in Vietnam to examine overlapping flowering periods of rice (Oryza sativa L.), weedy rice (O. sativa), and wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.), all of which are inter-fertile. We surveyed populations in two regions of the Mekong Delta, northern and southern, and at three sites in each of three habitats per region: fresh water, saline water, and acid sulfate soil. Weedy rice frequently flowered simultaneously with neighboring cultivated rice plants. Flowering was more seasonal in wild rice and often peaked in November and December. Peak flowering times of wild rice overlapped with adjacent rice fields at all of the saline sites and half of the acid sulfate sites. The longer flowering season of wild rice ensured that crop-to-wild gene flow was possible in fresh water habitats as well. Our second objective was to determine whether wild and weedy rice populations are exposed to pests that could be targeted by future transgenes, which may then provide fitness benefits. These populations shared many pathogen and insect herbivore species with cultivated rice (leaffolder, locust, cricket, planthoppers, rice bug, stem borer, sheath blight, blast, bacterial leaf blight, and brown spot). Damage by leaffolders and locusts was the most frequently observed insect feeding damage on all three rice types. Indicator species analysis revealed that most of the insect herbivores were associated with particular habitats, demonstrating the importance of broad geographic sampling for transgenic rice risk assessment. These survey data and the strong likelihood of gene flow from cultivated rice suggest that further studies are needed to examine the effects of transgenic traits such as resistance to pests on the abundance of wild and weedy rice.",many variety transgenic rice development country wild weedy relative cooccur crop evaluate possible risk associated pollenmediated transgene dispersal conducted twoyear survey vietnam examine overlapping flowering period rice oryza sativa l weedy rice sativa wild rice rufipogon griff interfertile surveyed population two region mekong delta northern southern three site three habitat per region fresh water saline water acid sulfate soil weedy rice frequently flowered simultaneously neighboring cultivated rice plant flowering seasonal wild rice often peaked november december peak flowering time wild rice overlapped adjacent rice field saline site half acid sulfate site longer flowering season wild rice ensured croptowild gene flow possible fresh water habitat well second objective determine whether wild weedy rice population exposed pest could targeted future transgene may provide fitness benefit population shared many pathogen insect herbivore specie cultivated rice leaffolder locust cricket planthopper rice bug stem borer sheath blight blast bacterial leaf blight brown spot damage leaffolders locust frequently observed insect feeding damage three rice type indicator specie analysis revealed insect herbivore associated particular habitat demonstrating importance broad geographic sampling transgenic rice risk assessment survey data strong likelihood gene flow cultivated rice suggest study needed examine effect transgenic trait resistance pest abundance wild weedy rice,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['examine effect transgenic trait resistance pest abundance wild weedy rice']}",1

12684879,Three types of defense-responsive genes are involved in resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases in rice.,"Bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Pyricularia grisea Sacc., respectively, are two of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide. To study the defense responses to infection with each of these pathogens, expression profiling of 12 defense-responsive genes was performed using near-isogenic rice lines that are resistant or susceptible to bacterial blight and fungal blast, respectively, and rice cultivars that are resistant or susceptible to both pathogens. All 12 genes showed constitutive expression, but expression levels increased in response to infection. Based on their expression patterns in 12 host-pathogen combinations, these genes could be classified into three types, pathogen non-specific (6), pathogen specific but race non-specific (4) and race specific (2). Most of the 12 genes were only responsive during incompatible interactions. These results suggest that bacterial blight and fungal blast resistances share common pathway(s), but are also regulated by different defense pathways in rice. Activation of the corresponding R gene is the key step that initiates the action of these genes in defense responses. The chromosomal locations and pathogen specificities of seven of the 12 genes were consistent with those of previously identified quantitative trait loci for rice disease resistance, which indicates that some of the 12 genes studied may have a phenotypic impact on disease resistance in rice.",bacterial blight fungal blast disease rice caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae pyricularia grisea sacc respectively two devastating disease rice worldwide study defense response infection pathogen expression profiling defenseresponsive gene performed using nearisogenic rice line resistant susceptible bacterial blight fungal blast respectively rice cultivar resistant susceptible pathogen gene showed constitutive expression expression level increased response infection based expression pattern hostpathogen combination gene could classified three type pathogen nonspecific pathogen specific race nonspecific race specific gene responsive incompatible interaction result suggest bacterial blight fungal blast resistance share common pathway also regulated different defense pathway rice activation corresponding r gene key step initiate action gene defense response chromosomal location pathogen specificity seven gene consistent previously identified quantitative trait locus rice disease resistance indicates gene studied may phenotypic impact disease resistance rice,1,"{'Disease': ['bacterial blight fungal blast disease rice', 'two devastating disease rice', 'previously identified quantitative trait locus rice disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
24162153,Major QTLs reduce the deleterious effects of high temperature on rice amylose content by increasing splicing efficiency of Wx pre-mRNA.,"We discovered four QTLs that maintain proper rice amylose content at high temperature by increasing the splicing efficiency of Wx gene. Amylose content mainly controlled by Wx gene is a key physicochemical property for eating and cooking quality in rice. During the grain filling stage, high temperature can harm rice grain quality by significantly reducing the amylose content in many rice varieties. Here, we provide genetic evidences between Wx gene expression and rice amylose content at high temperature, and identified several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in this pathway. We performed a genome-wide survey on a set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) which carried chromosomal segments from the heat resistant indica 9311 in the heat-sensitive japonica Nipponbare background. Four QTLs, qHAC4, qHAC8a, qHAC8b and qHAC10, which can reduce the deleterious effects of amylose content at high temperature, were identified and mapped to chromosome 4, 8, 8 and 10, respectively. The major QTL qHAC8a, with the highest LOD score of 6.196, was physically mapped to a small chromosome segment (~300 kb). The CSSLs carrying the qHAC8a, qHAC8b and/or qHAC4 from 9311 have the high pre-mRNA splicing efficiency of Wx gene and likely lead to stable amylose content at high temperature. Thus, increasing pre-mRNA processing efficiency of Wx gene could be an important regulation mechanism for maintaining stable amylose content in rice seeds at high temperature. In addition, our results provide a theoretical basis for breeding heat-stable grain in rice.",discovered four qtls maintain proper rice amylose content high temperature increasing splicing efficiency wx gene amylose content mainly controlled wx gene key physicochemical property eating cooking quality rice grain filling stage high temperature harm rice grain quality significantly reducing amylose content many rice variety provide genetic evidence wx gene expression rice amylose content high temperature identified several quantitative trait locus qtls pathway performed genomewide survey set chromosome segment substitution line cssls carried chromosomal segment heat resistant indica heatsensitive japonica nipponbare background four qtls qhac qhaca qhacb qhac reduce deleterious effect amylose content high temperature identified mapped chromosome respectively major qtl qhaca highest lod score physically mapped small chromosome segment kb cssls carrying qhaca qhacb andor qhac high premrna splicing efficiency wx gene likely lead stable amylose content high temperature thus increasing premrna processing efficiency wx gene could important regulation mechanism maintaining stable amylose content rice seed high temperature addition result provide theoretical basis breeding heatstable grain rice,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['deleterious effect amylose content high temperature']}",0
23216197,Comparative proteomic analysis of rice seedlings in response to inoculation with Bacillus cereus.,"Reports suggest that Bacillus spp. can be used to increase plant growth and resistance to disease, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Bacillus spp. and plant is not completely understood. In the present study, to clarify these underlying mechanisms, the interaction between Bacillus cereus and rice was investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Through comparative analysis, a total of 31 differentially expressed proteins were obtained upon B. cereus NMSL88 treatment, including 22 proteins that were up-regulated and nine that were down-regulated. These data indicated that certain proteins involved in plant growth and development were up-regulated, such as xyloglucan endotransglycosylase. Interestingly, proteins involved in defence were also up-regulated, including peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases and kinases. Thus, proteins associated with disease resistance characteristics were induced in the plants after exposure to B. cereus NMSL88.

In this study, comprehensive analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) transcriptome after M. grisea infection was conducted using robust-long serial analysis of gene expression. A total of 83,382 distinct 21-bp robust-long serial analysis of gene expression tags were identified from 627,262 individual tags isolated from the resistant (R), susceptible (S), and control (C) libraries. Sequence analysis revealed that the tags in the R and S libraries had a significant reduced matching rate to the rice genomic and expressed sequences in comparison to the C library. The high level of one-nucleotide mismatches of the R and S library tags was due to nucleotide conversions. The A-to-G and U-to-C nucleotide conversions were the most predominant types, which were induced in the M. grisea-infected plants. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that expression of the adenine deaminase and cytidine deaminase genes was highly induced after inoculation. In addition, many antisense transcripts were induced in infected plants and expression of four antisense transcripts was confirmed by strand-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Here, we have investigated the role of hormone defense pathways in Si-induced resistance to the rice brown spot fungus Cochliobolus miyabeanus. To delineate the involvement of multiple hormone pathways, a multidisciplinary approach was pursued, combining exogenous hormone applications, pharmacological inhibitor experiments, time-resolved hormone measurements, and bioassays with hormone-deficient and/or -insensitive mutant lines. Contrary to other types of induced resistance, we found Si-induced brown spot resistance to function independently of the classic immune hormones salicylic acid and jasmonic acid. Our data also rule out a major role of the abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin pathways, but suggest that Si mounts resistance to C. miyabeanus by preventing the fungus from hijacking the rice ethylene (ET) machinery. Interestingly, rather than suppressing rice ET signaling per se, Si probably interferes with the production and/or action of fungal ET.

38615784,The Oryza sativa transcriptome responds spatiotemporally to polystyrene nanoplastic stress.,"Nanoplastic represents an emerging abiotic stress facing modern agriculture, impacting global crop production. However, the molecular response of crop plants to this stress remains poorly understood at a spatiotemporal resolution. We therefore used RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptome expressed in rice (Oryza sativa) root and leaf organs at 1, 2, 4, and 8 d post exposure with nanoplastic. We revealed a striking similarity between the rice biomass dynamics in aboveground parts to that in belowground parts during nanoplastic stress, but transcriptome did not. At the global transcriptomic level, a total of 2332 differentially expressed genes were identified, with the majority being spatiotemporal specific, reflecting that nanoplastics predominantly regulate three processes in rice seedlings: (1) down-regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and starch, sucrose and nitrogen metabolism, (2) activation of defense responses such as brassinosteroid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and (3) modulation of jasmonic acid and cytokinin signaling pathways by transcription factors. Notably, the genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction were shown to be successively modulated by both root and leaf organs, particularly plant disease defense genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53, Os4CL3, OsPAL4, and MPK5), possibly indicating that nanoplastics affect rice growth indirectly through other biota. Finally, we associated biomass phenotypes with the temporal reprogramming of rice transcriptome by weighted gene co-expression network analysis, noting a significantly correlation with photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis that may reflect the mechanisms of biomass reduction. Functional analysis further identified PsbY, MYB, cytochrome P450, and AP2/ERF as hub genes governing these pathways.

However, only one AVR gene, AVR1-CO39, which corresponds to a resistance (R) gene Pi-CO39(t) in rice cv. CO39, has been found from 2539 thus far. In order to identify more AVR genes, we isolated 228 progeny strains from a cross between 2539 and Guy11, an M. oryzae strain with strong virulence on rice, and inoculated these strains onto 23 rice accessions (22 individual cultivars and a mixture of 14 cultivars) that are all resistant to 2539 but susceptible to Guy11. Unexpectedly, the experimental results indicated that the avirulence of 2539 on these rice cultivars appeared to be controlled only by the AVR1-CO39 locus. Consistent with this result, we further found that all except one of the rice cultivars were resistant to two transformed Guy11 strains carrying a 1.05-kb fragment containing the AVR1-CO39 gene from 2539. These results suggest that AVR1-CO39 is a predominant locus controlling the broad avirulence of 2539 on cultivated rice. Based on the results of this study and other previous studies, we infer that AVR1-CO39 is a species-wise rather than a cultivar-wise host-specific AVR locus of M. oryzae for rice.",magnaporthe oryzae previously found avirulent rice cultivar therefore assumed carry many avirulence avr gene however one avr gene avrco corresponds resistance r gene picot rice cv co found thus far order identify avr gene isolated progeny strain cross guy oryzae strain strong virulence rice inoculated strain onto rice accession individual cultivar mixture cultivar resistant susceptible guy unexpectedly experimental result indicated avirulence rice cultivar appeared controlled avrco locus consistent result found except one rice cultivar resistant two transformed guy strain carrying kb fragment containing avrco gene result suggest avrco predominant locus controlling broad avirulence cultivated rice based result study previous study infer avrco specieswise rather cultivarwise hostspecific avr locus oryzae rice,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
39558244,TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis of defense responses induced by the Bph3 gene following brown planthopper infection in rice.,"The brown planthopper (BPH) is an economically significant pest of rice. Bph3 is a key BPH resistance gene. However, the proteomic response of rice to BPH infestation, both in the presence and absence of Bph3, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we employed tandem mass tag labeling in conjunction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in rice samples. We detected 265 and 125 DEPs via comparison of samples infected with BPH for 2 and 4 days with untreated samples of the BPH-sensitive line R582. For the Bph3 introgression line R373, we identified 29 and 94 DEPs in the same comparisons. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that Bph3 significantly influences the abundance of proteins associated with metabolic pathways, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Moreover, Bph3 regulates the activity of proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and plant hormone signal transduction. Our results indicate that Bph3 enhances the resistance of rice to BPH mainly by inhibiting the down-regulation of proteins associated with metabolic pathways; calcium signaling, the MAPK signaling pathway, and plant hormone signal transduction might also be involved in BPH resistance induced by Bph3.",brown planthopper bph economically significant pest rice bph key bph resistance gene however proteomic response rice bph infestation presence absence bph remains largely unexplored study employed tandem mass tag labeling conjunction liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry lcmsms analysis identify differentially expressed protein deps rice sample detected deps via comparison sample infected bph day untreated sample bphsensitive line r bph introgression line r identified deps comparison bioinformatic analysis revealed bph significantly influence abundance protein associated metabolic pathway secondary metabolite biosynthesis microbial metabolism diverse environment phenylpropanoid biosynthesis moreover bph regulates activity protein involved calcium signaling pathway mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk signaling pathway plant hormone signal transduction result indicate bph enhances resistance rice bph mainly inhibiting downregulation protein associated metabolic pathway calcium signaling mapk signaling pathway plant hormone signal transduction might also involved bph resistance induced bph,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

12671749,Expression and inheritance of hypersensitive resistance to rice hoja blanca virus mediated by the viral nucleocapsid protein gene in transgenic rice.,"Rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV) is a major virus disease of economic importance affecting rice in northern South America, Central America and the Caribbean. This is the first report of transgenic resistance to RHBV and the transformation of an indica rice variety from Latin America. Rice transformed with the RHBV nucleocapsid protein ( N) gene had a significant reduction in disease development. Several reactions were observed that ranged from susceptible to completely resistant plants (immunity). The resistant reactions were characterized by the production of local lesions like a hypersensitive reaction or a recovery phenotype with the emergence of symptom-less new leaves. These transgenic RHBV-resistant rice lines expressed the N gene RNA at low levels that were below the detection limit by Northern blots and only resolved by RT-PCR. The nucleocapsid protein could not be detected in any of the transgenic plants either by Western or ELISA tests. These results suggest that the resistance encoded by the N gene in these plants appears to be mediated by RNA. When challenged with RHBV, the resistant transgenic lines showed a significant increased performance for important agronomic traits including the number of tillers, the number of grains per plant and the yield as compared to the susceptible control. Furthermore, upon inoculation some of the most-resistant transgenic lines showed agronomic traits similar to the uninoculated non-transgenic Cica 8 control. Using both agronomic traits and disease severity as criteria, several of the most-resistant lines were followed through the R(4) generation and demonstrated that the N gene and RHBV resistance was inherited in a stable manner.

29161206,A Hypersensitivity-Like Response to Meloidogyne graminicola in Rice (Oryza sativa).,"Meloidogyne graminicola is a major plant-parasitic nematode affecting rice cultivation in Asia. Resistance to this nematode was found in the African rice genotypes Oryza glaberrima and O. longistaminata; however, due to interspecific hybrid sterility, the introgression of resistance genes in the widely consumed O. sativa varieties remains challenging. Recently, resistance was found in O. sativa and, here, we report for the first time the histological and genetic characterization of the resistance to M. graminicola in Zhonghua 11, an O. sativa variety. Bright-light microscopy and fluorescence observations of the root tissue of this variety revealed that the root cells surrounding the nematode displayed a hypersensitivity-like reaction with necrotic cells at early stages of infection when nematodes are migrating in the root's mesoderm. An accumulation of presumably phenolic compounds in the nematodes' neighboring root cells was also observed. In addition, at a later stage of infection, not only were few feeding sites observed but also the giant cells were underdeveloped, underlining an incompatible interaction. Furthermore, we generated a hybrid O. sativa population by crossing Zhonghua 11 with the susceptible O. sativa variety IR64 in order to describe the genetic background of this resistance. Our data suggested that the resistance to M. graminicola infection was qualitative rather than quantitative and, therefore, major resistance genes must be involved in this infection process.

30536828,Potassium deficiency aggravates yield loss in rice by restricting the translocation of non-structural carbohydrates under Sarocladium oryzae infection condition.,"Sheath rot disease (ShR) caused by Sarocladium oryzae (S. oryzae) infection is an emerging disease that causes severe yield loss by restricting the translocation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Potassium (K) nutrition plays a critical role in disease resistance and the exportation of NSC. However, the physiological mechanisms of K with respect to ShR have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. The objectives of this study were to reveal the mechanisms by which K increases ShR resistance by regulating NSC translocation of rice, therefore, a field experiment combined with an inoculation experiment was conducted. We demonstrate that ShR disease incidence and disease index decreased dramatically with an increasing K application. K deficiency sharply induced the accumulation of NSC in the flag leaf (FL) and flag leaf sheath (FLS) under S. oryzae infection condition, which reduced the contribution of transferred NSC to final yield. A permutational multivariate analysis showed that K deficiency had a greater (49.0%, P < 0.001) effect on the NSC content variation in FL than that of S. oryzae infection (15.0%, P < 0.001). S. oryzae infection dramatically increased the difference in apparent transferred mass of NSC and cell membrane injury of diseased organs between K-deficient and K-sufficient rice. Finally, we demonstrate that cell membrane injury was a limiting factor imposed by K deficiency, which restricts the export of NSC from source organs. This work highlights the importance of K in improving ShR resistance by regulating NSC translocation (particularly the stem NSC).",sheath rot disease shr caused sarocladium oryzae oryzae infection emerging disease cause severe yield loss restricting translocation nonstructural carbohydrate nsc potassium k nutrition play critical role disease resistance exportation nsc however physiological mechanism k respect shr thoroughly elucidated date objective study reveal mechanism k increase shr resistance regulating nsc translocation rice therefore field experiment combined inoculation experiment conducted demonstrate shr disease incidence disease index decreased dramatically increasing k application k deficiency sharply induced accumulation nsc flag leaf fl flag leaf sheath fl oryzae infection condition reduced contribution transferred nsc final yield permutational multivariate analysis showed k deficiency greater p effect nsc content variation fl oryzae infection p oryzae infection dramatically increased difference apparent transferred mass nsc cell membrane injury diseased organ kdeficient ksufficient rice finally demonstrate cell membrane injury limiting factor imposed k deficiency restricts export nsc source organ work highlight importance k improving shr resistance regulating nsc translocation particularly stem nsc,2,"{'Disease': ['sheath rot disease shr', 'critical role disease resistance exportation nsc', 'apparent transferred mass nsc cell membrane injury diseased organ kdeficient ksufficient rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['greater p effect nsc content variation']}",0

In this study, two rice lines, KP1 and KP2-Hd1, were obtained by introgressing the blast resistance genes Pi1 and Pi2 into KY131, respectively. However, both lines headed later than KY131. RICE60K SNP array analysis showed that Hd1 closely linked to Pi2 was introgressed into KP2-Hd1, and the linkage drag of Hd1 was broken by recombination. On the other hand, no known flowering genes were introgressed into KP1. Gene diagnosis by resequencing six flowering genes showed that KP1 carried functional Hd16 and Ghd8 alleles. Due to its suppression role in heading under long-day conditions, Ghd8 was chosen as the target for gene editing to disrupt its function. Four sgRNAs targeting different sites within Ghd8 were utilized to induce large-deletion mutations, which were easy to detect via agarose gel electrophoresis. All the ghd8-mutated KP1 lines were resistant to rice blast disease and headed earlier than the control KP1, even than KY131, under natural long-day conditions, which ensures its growth in Northeast China.

18943742,The role of silicon in preventing appressorial penetration by the rice blast fungus.,"To test the hypothesis that silicon (Si) confers resistance against appressorial penetration of the rice blast fungus, the proportion of appressorial penetration into the leaf epidermis to total appressoria formed was compared among rice plants amended with various rates of silica gel to those plants nonamended. The amounts of Si in the youngest leaves were consistent with the amounts of silica gel applied to the rice plants. Relative Si levels on the adaxial surface of leaves as detected by energy dispersive X-ray analysis also increased with the amounts of silica gel applied. Based on light microscopic observation of the adaxial surface of rice leaves, the proportion of appressorial penetration was reduced by increasing amounts of silica gel applied and increased with the length of period after spray inoculation. Consequently, these results strongly support the hypothesis and suggest that Si in the leaf epidermis may confer resistance against appressorial penetration. Meanwhile, the number of lesions per leaf also decreased with the amount of Si applied, while only a certain part of penetrated appressoria could become sporulating susceptible lesions. This suggests that Si also confers physiological resistance against blast infection after the penetration.",test hypothesis silicon si confers resistance appressorial penetration rice blast fungus proportion appressorial penetration leaf epidermis total appressoria formed compared among rice plant amended various rate silica gel plant nonamended amount si youngest leaf consistent amount silica gel applied rice plant relative si level adaxial surface leaf detected energy dispersive xray analysis also increased amount silica gel applied based light microscopic observation adaxial surface rice leaf proportion appressorial penetration reduced increasing amount silica gel applied increased length period spray inoculation consequently result strongly support hypothesis suggest si leaf epidermis may confer resistance appressorial penetration meanwhile number lesion per leaf also decreased amount si applied certain part penetrated appressoria could become sporulating susceptible lesion suggests si also confers physiological resistance blast infection penetration,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

A total of eight functional blast R-genes were identified among nine NBS-LRR genes, and some of these showed resistance to three or more blast strains. Evolutionary analysis indicated that high nucleotide diversity of coding regions served as important parameters in the determination of gene resistance. We also observed that amino-acid variants (nonsynonymous mutations, insertions, or deletions) in essential motifs of the NBS domain contribute to the blast resistance capacity of NBS-LRR genes. These results suggested that the NBS regions might also play an important role in resistance specificity determination.

Compared with leaf blast resistance, our understanding of panicle blast resistance is limited. The japonica landrace Jiangnanwan from Taihu Lake region in China shows highly resistance to panicle and leaf blast. In this study, three generations (F2:5, F2:6, F2:7) consisting of 221 RILs (recombination inbreeding lines), developed from the cross of Jiangnanwan and Suyunuo, a susceptible-blast japonica variety, were evaluated for panicle blast resistance in the fields and leaf blast resistance in greenhouse in Nanjing in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

39556648,The blast pathogen effector AVR-Pik binds and stabilizes rice heavy metal-associated (HMA) proteins to co-opt their function in immunity.,"Intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in immunity across multiple domains of life. In plants, a subset of NLRs contain noncanonical integrated domains that are thought to have evolved from host targets of pathogen effectors to serve as pathogen baits. However, the functions of host proteins with similarity to NLR integrated domains and the extent to which they are targeted by pathogen effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the blast fungus effector AVR-Pik binds a subset of related rice proteins containing a heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain, one of the domains that has repeatedly integrated into plant NLR immune receptors. We find that AVR-Pik binding stabilizes the rice small HMA (sHMA) proteins OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20. Knockout of OsHIPP20 causes enhanced disease resistance towards the blast pathogen, indicating that OsHIPP20 is a susceptibility gene (S-gene). We propose that AVR-Pik has evolved to bind HMA domain proteins and co-opt their function to suppress immunity. Yet this binding carries a trade-off, it triggers immunity in plants carrying NLR receptors with integrated HMA domains.",intracellular nucleotidebinding domain leucinerich repeatcontaining nlr receptor play crucial role immunity across multiple domain life plant subset nlrs contain noncanonical integrated domain thought evolved host target pathogen effector serve pathogen bait however function host protein similarity nlr integrated domain extent targeted pathogen effector remain largely unknown show blast fungus effector avrpik bind subset related rice protein containing heavy metalassociated hma domain one domain repeatedly integrated plant nlr immune receptor find avrpik binding stabilizes rice small hma shma protein oshipp oshipp knockout oshipp cause enhanced disease resistance towards blast pathogen indicating oshipp susceptibility gene sgene propose avrpik evolved bind hma domain protein coopt function suppress immunity yet binding carry tradeoff trigger immunity plant carrying nlr receptor integrated hma domain,4,"{'Disease': ['largely unknown show blast fungus effector', 'enhanced disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['host protein similarity nlr integrated domain extent targeted pathogen effector', 'largely unknown show blast fungus effector']}",1

However, to our knowledge, regulation of the proteomic and metabolic networks in the ShB-resistant transgenic rice plants has not been studied. In the present investigation, the relative proteome and metabolome profiles of the non-transformed wild-type and the AtNPR1-transgenic rice lines prior to and subsequent to the R. solani infection were investigated. Total proteins from wild type and transgenic plants were investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by mass spectrometry (MS). The metabolomics study indicated an increased abundance of various metabolites, which draws parallels with the proteomic analysis. Furthermore, the proteome data was cross-examined using network analysis which identified modules that were rich in known as well as novel immunity-related prognostic proteins, particularly the mitogen-activated protein kinase 6, probable protein phosphatase 2C1, probable trehalose-phosphate phosphatase 2 and heat shock protein. A novel protein, 14-3-3GF14f was observed to be upregulated in the leaves of the transgenic rice plants after ShB infection, and the possible mechanistic role of this protein in ShB resistance may be investigated further.",generation sheath blight shbresistant transgenic rice plant expression arabidopsis npr gene significant development research field biotic stress however knowledge regulation proteomic metabolic network shbresistant transgenic rice plant studied present investigation relative proteome metabolome profile nontransformed wildtype atnprtransgenic rice line prior subsequent r solani infection investigated total protein wild type transgenic plant investigated using twodimensional gel electrophoresis de followed mass spectrometry m metabolomics study indicated increased abundance various metabolite draw parallel proteomic analysis furthermore proteome data crossexamined using network analysis identified module rich known well novel immunityrelated prognostic protein particularly mitogenactivated protein kinase probable protein phosphatase c probable trehalosephosphate phosphatase heat shock protein novel protein gff observed upregulated leaf transgenic rice plant shb infection possible mechanistic role protein shb resistance may investigated,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

34931899,Morphological and Molecular Analysis of Fungal Species Associated with Blast and Brown Spot Diseases of <i>Oryza sativa</i>.,"Fungal diseases blast and brown spot in rice cause severe yield losses worldwide. Blast is caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, and <i>Bipolaris oryzae</i> is reported as the main causal organism of brown spot. Both diseases cause leaf lesions that are difficult differentiate until the later stages. Early detection and differentiation of the lesions would help the adoption of disease management strategies specific to the pathogens and prevent reductions in the quality and quantity of rice yields. This study was conducted in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka over five consecutive rice cultivating seasons to characterize the causal fungi of rice blast and brown spot diseases by morphological and molecular means and to develop a visual guide to differentiate the two diseases. Disease incidence was recorded in 114 fields from 2017 to 2019, and fungal isolates associated with the lesions of both diseases were cultured and subjected to morphological and molecular characterization. Competitive growth interactions between <i>M. oryzae</i> and the more common individual fungal isolates of the brown spot lesions were evaluated. Fungal metagenomic analysis was conducted for the fungal species isolated from brown spot lesions. A suppression of blast accompanied by an increased incidence of brown spot disease was observed during the study period. <i>M. oryzae</i> was confirmed to be the causal organism of the blast, and >20 species of fungi were identified to be associated with brown spot lesions through morphological and molecular studies and metagenomic analyses. Fungal internal transcribed spacer region sequencing revealed genetic variation in the highly conserved region of DNA sequences of blast and brown spot fungal isolates. <i>B. oryzae</i>, <i>Curvularia</i>, and <i>Microdochium</i> species were commonly isolated from brown spot lesions. In vitro competitive growth interactions between the fungal isolates revealed growth suppression of <i>M. oryzae</i> by the fungal isolates associated with brown spot lesions. Similarly, it can be speculated that the abundance and severity of blast in the field may have an influence on brown spot-associated fungi. A simple visual guide was developed to differentiate blast and brown spot lesions.

(Graminales: Poaceae), in Asia. The current study investigated the resistance of 17 rice varieties or lines to C. medinalis and behavioral responses of the insect to varieties of different corrected damage ratings (CDRs) and damaged leaves scales (DLSs). The results showed that most varieties (or lines) commonly cultured in rice production were susceptible (DLS 3 and 5) to damage caused by C. medinalis; Yangjing 9538, 91SP, and TN1 were the most susceptible (DLS 7 and 9). A significant positive correlation was observed between CDR and leaf width and chlorophyll content in rice leaves, whereas no significant correlations between resistance and plant height and leaf length were found. The number of eggs laid by C. medinalis adult females significantly increased with CDR. There was a significant difference in the number of eggs laid for varieties of different DLSs. The number laid on varieties of DLS 9 was 44.4, 134.5, and 466.7% greater than DLS 7, 5 and 3, respectively; the number laid on varieties of DLS 7 was 65.5% greater than DLS 5 and 300% greater than DLS 3; and the number laid on those of DLS 5 was 141.7% greater than DLS 3. Developmental duration (day) of larvae, the body length of fifth instar larvae and pupae weight also significantly increased with CDR. A significant difference of to excised leaves was also found among different DLSs with a higher proportion of both first and third instars settled on the leaves of high DLS.

16025655,[Safety of rice grains and mycotoxins - a historical review of yellow rice mycotoxicoses].,"Aflatoxins, the most powerful mycotoxins, were brought to the attention fo the people in the early 1960s with the outbreak of the turkey ""X"" disease in England. However, the history of mycotoxin research in Japan began 100 years ago. In 1891, Sakaki demonstrated that moldy, unpolished rice was fatal to experimental animals, with symptoms indicating paralysis of the central nervous system (Shoshin-kakke). In 1920, Prof. I. Miyake and Dr. Takada first reported that Penicillium commune, which was known as a causal agent of ""Mossy diseased rice"" was found to be toxic to experimental animals by feeding the moldy rice to rabbits and rats.With such a historical background, taking the idea of ""rice, fungus and toxin"" as a working hypothesis, Miyake and his co-workers discovered the first sample of yellow rice grains from Taiwanese and domestic rice, from which was isolated a species of Penicillium and later identified it with P. citreonigrum (=P. toxicarium). The fungus produced a highly toxic metabolite, citreoviridin. Unfortunately because this study was published during wartime, it failed to alert the world to the potential or actual dangers of the toxicity of common molds. After World War II, Japanese people suffered for some years from a shortage in domestic rice production and depended on foreign countries to supply rice, which led to the toxicological screening on fungal isolates from polluted rice grains by Dr. Tsunoda and his co-workers. AMong the isolates from imported rice, there were two species of Penicillium which were particularly associated with high toxicity; P. islandicum responsible for brownish discolored rice, and P. citrinum responsible for yellowish rice. P. islandicum produces two hepatotoxic metabolites: luteoskyrin and cyclochlorotine, while a nephrotoxic of P. citrinum is citrinin. These toxicological characters, including the induction of cancer and chemical structures, were studied by Profs. uraguchi, Saito, Shibata, Tatsuno and their co-workers. In this way, toxic disturbances associated with the consumption of rice contaminated with these Peniciliium species occurred and became known under the collective name of the ""Yellow rice syndrome"". Although no human cases of poisoning were recorded, scientists in the field of mycotoxin research recommended to the Japanese Government that administrative action should be taken to protect the people against any possible hazards from ""yellow rice"". Consequently, mycological inspections of imported rice were started by the government. The safety control system for domestic rice during post-harvest handling and long-term storage has been progressively established after learning of these problems.",aflatoxin powerful mycotoxin brought attention fo people early outbreak turkey x disease england however history mycotoxin research japan began year ago sakaki demonstrated moldy unpolished rice fatal experimental animal symptom indicating paralysis central nervous system shoshinkakke prof miyake dr takada first reported penicillium commune known causal agent mossy diseased rice found toxic experimental animal feeding moldy rice rabbit ratswith historical background taking idea rice fungus toxin working hypothesis miyake coworkers discovered first sample yellow rice grain taiwanese domestic rice isolated specie penicillium later identified p citreonigrum p toxicarium fungus produced highly toxic metabolite citreoviridin unfortunately study published wartime failed alert world potential actual danger toxicity common mold world war ii japanese people suffered year shortage domestic rice production depended foreign country supply rice led toxicological screening fungal isolates polluted rice grain dr tsunoda coworkers among isolates imported rice two specie penicillium particularly associated high toxicity p islandicum responsible brownish discolored rice p citrinum responsible yellowish rice p islandicum produce two hepatotoxic metabolite luteoskyrin cyclochlorotine nephrotoxic p citrinum citrinin toxicological character including induction cancer chemical structure studied prof uraguchi saito shibata tatsuno coworkers way toxic disturbance associated consumption rice contaminated peniciliium specie occurred became known collective name yellow rice syndrome although human case poisoning recorded scientist field mycotoxin research recommended japanese government administrative action taken protect people possible hazard yellow rice consequently mycological inspection imported rice started government safety control system domestic rice postharvest handling longterm storage progressively established learning problem,2,"{'Disease': ['penicillium commune known causal agent mossy diseased rice', 'idea rice fungus toxin working hypothesis miyake coworkers', 'p citreonigrum p toxicarium fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['moldy unpolished rice fatal experimental animal symptom']}",2
15118822,"High-resolution genetic mapping of Xa27(t), a new bacterial blight resistance gene in rice, Oryza sativa L.","Bacterial blight of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo) (Ishyama) Dye, is one of the serious diseases prevalent throughout Asia. In a previous study, a resistance ( R) locus was transferred from the tetraploid wild rice Oryza minuta to the cultivated rice species, Oryza sativa L. Here, we report the fine genetic mapping of the R locus, tentatively designated as Xa27(t). We performed disease evaluation with an Xa27(t) near-isogenic line, IRBB27, testing 35 Xoo strains collected from 11 countries. The Xa27(t) locus conferred a high level of resistance to 27 strains and moderate resistance to three strains. Resistance of the Xa27(t) gene was developmentally regulated in IRBB27 and showed semi-dominant or a dosage effect in the cv. CO39 genetic background. As a prelude to cloning Xa27(t), a molecular mapping strategy was employed with a large mapping population consisting of 3,875 gametes. Three molecular markers, M336, M1081, and M1059, closely linked to Xa27(t), were identified to facilitate the mapping of Xa27(t) to the long arm of chromosome 6. The Xa27(t) locus was confirmed by chromosome landing of M1081 and M1095 markers on the rice genome. Markers derived from the genomic sequence of O. sativa cv. Nipponbare were used to further saturate the Xa27(t) genomic region.

29566243,"Overexpression of miR169o, an Overlapping MicroRNA in Response to Both Nitrogen Limitation and Bacterial Infection, Promotes Nitrogen Use Efficiency and Susceptibility to Bacterial Blight in Rice.","Limiting nitrogen (N) supply contributes to improved resistance to bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in susceptible rice (Oryza sativa). To understand the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this phenomenon, 63 differentially expressed overlapping miRNAs in response to Xoo infection and N limitation stress in rice were identified through deep RNA sequencing and stem-loop quantitative real-time PCR. Among these, miR169o was further assessed as a typical overlapping miRNA through the overexpression of the miR169o primary gene. Osa-miR169o-OX plants were taller, and had more biomass accumulation with significantly increased nitrate and total amino acid contents in roots than the wild type (WT). Transcript level assays showed that under different N supply conditions, miR169o oppositely regulated NRT2, and this is reduced under normal N supply conditions but remarkably induced under N-limiting stress. On the other hand, osa-miR169o-OX plants also displayed increased disease lesion lengths and reduced transcriptional levels of defense gene (PR1b, PR10a, PR10b and PAL) compared with the WT after inoculation with Xoo. In addition, miR169o impeded Xoo-mediated NRT transcription. Therefore, the overlapping miR169o contributes to increase N use efficiency and negatively regulates the resistance to BB in rice. Consistently, transient expression of NF-YA genes in rice protoplasts promoted the transcripts of PR genes and NRT2 genes, while it reduced the transcripts of NRT1 genes.

32535325,Characterization and genetic analysis of the oshpl3 rice lesion mimic mutant showing spontaneous cell death and enhanced bacterial blight resistance.,"Plant lesion mimic mutants have been used as ideal materials for studying pathogen defense mechanisms due to their spontaneous activation of defense responses in plants. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a rice lesion mimic mutant, oshpl3. The oshpl3 mutant initially displayed white spots on leaves of 7-day-old seedlings, and the white spots gradually turned into large brown spots during plant development, accompanied by poor metrics of major agronomic traits. Histochemical analysis showed that spontaneous cell death and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> hyperaccumulation occurred in oshpl3. Defense responses were induced in the oshpl3 mutant, such as enhanced ROS signaling activated by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and also upregulated expression of genes involved in pathogenesis and JA metabolism. These defense responses enhanced resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The mutated gene was identified as OsHPL3 (LOC_Os02g02000) by map-based cloning. A G1006A mutation occurred in OsHPL3, causing a G-to-D mutation of the 295th amino acid in the transmembrane region of OsHPL3. OsHPL3 localized to the chloroplast, cytoplasm, and another unknown organelle, while the mutated protein OsHPL3<sup>G295D</sup> was not obviously observed in the chloroplast, suggesting that the G295D mutation affected its chloroplast localization.

In the present study, we screened 312 rice accessions for resistance to SBPH. The indica variety, N22, is highly resistant to SBPH. One hundred and eighty two recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of N22 and the highly susceptible variety, USSR5, were used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of resistances to SBPH and RSV. In a modified seedbox screening test, three QTLs for SBPH resistance, qSBPH2, qSBPH3 and qSBPH7.1, were mapped on chromosomes 2, 3 and 7, a total explaining 35.1% of the phenotypic variance. qSBPH7.2 and qSBPH11.2, conferring antibiosis against SBPH, were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 and accounted for 20.7% of the total phenotypic variance.

In a previous study, it was reported that two recombinant rice (Oryza sativa L.) defensin (OsDEF) genes (OsDEF7 and OsDEF8) produced heterologously by bacteria inhibited the growth of several phytopathogen. Here, we analyzed gene expression patterns in Thai jasmine rice (O. sativa L. ssp. indica 'KDML 105') using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and compared them with those in Japanese rice (O. sativa L. ssp. japonica 'Nipponbare'). Although the cultivars exhibited similar gene expression patterns at the developmental stages examined, the expression levels differed between organs. Upon Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae infection in the leaves, both OsDEFs were highly upregulated at 8 days post-infection, suggesting that they play a role in pathogen defense. Moreover, in silico analyses revealed that OsDEF expression levels were affected by drought, cold, imbibition, anoxia, and dehydration stress. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions, we found that both OsDEFs were in the extracellular compartment, confirming their functions against pathogen infection. However, when recombinant OsDEFs (without GFP) were produced in tobacco BY-2 cells or Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, they could not be detected in either the culture medium or the cells. Yet, N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with OsDEF7 or OsDEF8 constructs exhibited in planta inhibitory activity against the phytopathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. glycines, suggesting that recombinant OsDEFs were present.

Foreground selection for the five target genes was performed using closely linked markers and tracked in each backcross generations. Background selection in plants carrying the target genes was performed by using 100 simple sequence repeat markers. Amongst backcross derivatives, the plant carrying five target genes and maximum recurrent parent genome content was selected in each generation and hybridized with recipient parent. Eighteen BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> plants were obtained by selfing the selected BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>1</sub> line. Amongst the pyramided lines, 3 lines were homozygous for all the target genes.

22846459,HINT: High-quality protein interactomes and their applications in understanding human disease.,"A global map of protein-protein interactions in cellular systems provides key insights into the workings of an organism. A repository of well-validated high-quality protein-protein interactions can be used in both large- and small-scale studies to generate and validate a wide range of functional hypotheses. We develop HINT (http://hint.yulab.org) - a database of high-quality protein-protein interactomes for human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Oryza sativa. These were collected from several databases and filtered both systematically and manually to remove low-quality/erroneous interactions. The resulting datasets are classified by type (binary physical interactions vs. co-complex associations) and data source (high-throughput systematic setups vs. literature-curated small-scale experiments). We find strong sociological sampling biases in literature-curated datasets of small-scale interactions. An interactome without such sampling biases was used to understand network properties of human disease-genes - hubs are unlikely to cause disease, but if they do, they usually cause multiple disorders. HINT is of significant interest to researchers in all fields of biology as it addresses the ubiquitous need of having a repository of high-quality protein-protein interactions. These datasets can be utilized to generate specific hypotheses about specific proteins and/or pathways, as well as analyzing global properties of cellular networks.

Structural analyses showed that the ZGLs (designated Tv-ZGL2 and Tv-ZGL3) were the same as the glycosphingolipids ZGL2 and ZGL4 from Acremonium sp., which are described in our previous paper. ZGLs have the following structure: Man(alpha1-6)GlcN(alpha1-2)Ins-P-Cer (Tv-ZGL2) and phosphocholine (PC)-->6Man(alpha1-6)GlcN(alpha1-2)Ins-P-Cer (Tv-ZGL3). To determine whether these ZGLs have functional roles in plant-fungus interaction, we tested to determine whether they would induce defense responses in cultured rice cells. We found that T. viride's ZGLs elicited expression of the PAL and PBZ1 genes, both of which are associated with pathogen resistance. Tv-ZGL2 induced cell death at a moderate rate.

24832615,Fine mapping of the lesion mimic and early senescence 1 (lmes1) in rice (Oryza sativa).,"A novel rice mutant, lesion mimic and early senescence 1 (lmes1), was induced from the rice 93-11 cultivar in a γ-ray field. This mutant exhibited spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of pathogen attack at the beginning of the tillering stage. Moreover, at the booting stage, lmes1 mutants exhibited a significantly increased MDA but decreased chlorophyll content, soluble protein content and photosynthetic rate in the leaves, which are indicative of an early senescence phenotype. The lmes1 mutant was significantly more resistant than 93-11 against rice bacterial blight infection, which was consistent with a marked increase in the expression of three resistance-related genes. Here, we employed a map-based cloning approach to finely map the lmes1 gene. In an initial mapping with 94 F2 individuals derived from a cross between the lmes1 mutant and Nipponbare, the lmes1 gene was located in a 10.6-cM region on the telomere of the long arm of chromosome 7 using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. To finely map lmes1, we derived two F2 populations with 940 individuals from two crosses between the lmes1 mutant and two japonica rice varieties, Nipponbare and 02428.

23210861,Characterization and genetic analysis of a novel rice spotted-leaf mutant HM47 with broad-spectrum resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"A stable inherited rice spotted-leaf mutant HM47 derived from an EMS-induced IR64 mutant bank was identified. The mutant expressed hypersensitive response (HR)-like symptoms throughout its whole life from the first leaf to the flag leaf, without pathogen invasion. Initiation of the lesions was induced by light under natural summer field conditions. Expression of pathogenesis-related genes including PAL, PO-C1, POX22.3 and PBZ1 was enhanced significantly in association with cell death and accumulation of H2 O2 at and around the site of lesions in the mutant in contrast to that in the wild-type (WT). Disease reaction to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae from the Philippines and China showed that HM47 is a broad-spectrum disease-resistant mutant with enhanced resistance to multiple races of bacterial blight pathogens tested. An F2 progeny test showed that bacterial blight resistance to race HB-17 was co-segregated with the expression of lesions. Genetic analysis indicated that the spotted-leaf trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively named spl(HM47) , flanked by two insertion/deletion markers in a region of approximately 74 kb on the long arm of chromosome 4. Ten open reading frames are predicted, and all of them are expressed proteins.

17657469,Functional analysis of Xa3/Xa26 family members in rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.,"Plant disease resistant (R) genes are frequently clustered in the genome. The diversity of members in a complex R-gene family may provide variation in resistance specificity. Rice Xa3/Xa26, conferring resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase-type protein and belongs to a multigene family, consisting of Xa3/Xa26, MRKa, MRKc and MRKd in rice cultivar Minghui 63. MRKa and MRKc are intact genes, while MRKd is a pseudogene. Complementary analyses showed that MRKa and MRKc could not mediate resistance to Xoo when regulated by their native promoters, but MRKa not MRKc conferred partial resistance to Xoo when regulated by a strong constitutive promoter. Plants carrying truncated XA3/XA26, which lacked the kinase domain, were compromised in their resistance to Xoo. However, the kinase domain of MRKa could partially restore the function of the truncated XA3/XA26 in resistance. MRKa and MRKc showed similar expression pattern as Xa3/Xa26, which expressed only in the vascular systems of different tissues. The expressional characteristic of MRKa and MRKc perfectly fits the function of genes conferring resistance to Xoo, a vascular pathogen. These results suggest that although MRKa and MRKc cannot mediate bacterial blight resistance nowadays, they may be once effective genes for Xoo resistance. Their expressional characteristic and sequence similarity to Xa3/Xa26 will provide templates for generating novel recognition specificity to face the evolution of Xoo. In addition, both LRR and kinase domains encoded by Xa3/Xa26 and MRKa are the functional determinants and MRKa-mediated resistance is dosage-dependent.",plant disease resistant r gene frequently clustered genome diversity member complex rgene family may provide variation resistance specificity rice xaxa conferring resistance xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo encodes leucinerich repeat lrr receptor kinasetype protein belongs multigene family consisting xaxa mrka mrkc mrkd rice cultivar minghui mrka mrkc intact gene mrkd pseudogene complementary analysis showed mrka mrkc could mediate resistance xoo regulated native promoter mrka mrkc conferred partial resistance xoo regulated strong constitutive promoter plant carrying truncated xaxa lacked kinase domain compromised resistance xoo however kinase domain mrka could partially restore function truncated xaxa resistance mrka mrkc showed similar expression pattern xaxa expressed vascular system different tissue expressional characteristic mrka mrkc perfectly fit function gene conferring resistance xoo vascular pathogen result suggest although mrka mrkc mediate bacterial blight resistance nowadays may effective gene xoo resistance expressional characteristic sequence similarity xaxa provide template generating novel recognition specificity face evolution xoo addition lrr kinase domain encoded xaxa mrka functional determinant mrkamediated resistance dosagedependent,4,"{'Disease': ['plant disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
16228246,"High-resolution mapping, cloning and molecular characterization of the Pi-k ( h ) gene of rice, which confers resistance to Magnaporthe grisea.","In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the gene-for-gene type of pathogen resistance, high-resolution genetic and physical mapping of resistance loci is required to facilitate map-based cloning of resistance genes. Here, we report the molecular mapping and cloning of a dominant gene (Pi-k ( h )) present in the rice line Tetep, which is associated with resistance to rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea.

Several research works have been conducted on GABA production from germinated brown rice. However, the yielded GABA (10.1-69.2 mg/100 g germinated brown rice) was comparatively low; thus the amount was insufficient to be used as active ingredients in functional foods. The objective of this study was to explore alternative methods in order to gain higher yield of GABA. A new process of repeated soaking (in tap water at 35 °C, 3 h) and incubation (at 37 °C, 21 h) during germination was developed. The amount of GABA produced was highest at 116.88 ± 9.24 mg/100 g germinated brown rice (dry basis). However, an unpleasant odour was generated by some microorganisms during long germination.

Nevertheless, the genetic basis of resistance remains poorly understood for most rice varieties, and new resistance genes remain to be identified. We identified the resistance gene corresponding to the cloned avirulence gene ACE1 using pairs of isogenic strains of Magnaporthe grisea differing only by their ACE1 allele. This resistance gene was mapped on the short arm of rice chromosome 8 using progenies from the crosses IR64 (resistant) x Azucena (susceptible) and Azucena x Bala (resistant). The isogenic strains also permitted the detection of this resistance gene in several rice varieties, including the differential isogenic line C101LAC. Allelism tests permitted us to distinguish this gene from two other resistance genes [ Pi11 and Pi-29(t)] that are present on the short arm of chromosome 8.

19203276,The pi40 gene for durable resistance to rice blast and molecular analysis of pi40-advanced backcross breeding lines.,"Rice blast severely reduces production in both irrigated and water-stressed upland ecosystems of tropical and temperate countries. Nearly 50 blast resistance genes have been identified and some of those are incorporated into several rice cultivars. However, most of the resistance genes break down in a few years because of their race specificity and the rapid change in pathogenicity of the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). The objective of this study was to analyze advanced backcross breeding lines (ABL) possessing the gene Pi40 for durable rice blast resistance. In all, 4 resistant genotypes, 4 japonica cultivars, and 10 monogenic differential rice genotypes with some known resistance genes were bioassayed in the greenhouse using seven sequential plantings and 29 virulent M. grisea isolates of Korea. The genotypes with the Pi40 gene had <3% diseased leaf area, which was significantly below the disease threshold level of 40% considered for durable blast resistance. Moreover, the genotypes with the Pi40 gene expressed compatibility with only two to three virulent M. grisea isolates supporting durability of resistance, in contrast to susceptible cultivars with >50% diseased leaf area and 10 compatible isolates. Of the 10 known resistance genes tested, Piz-t, Piz-5, and Pi9 showed differential reactions to the pathogen isolates in seven plantings. Genotyping of the ABL with 260 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed rapid conversion toward recurrent parent genotypes with fewer donor chromosomal segments (5.3 to 14.5%).

24099390,Application of resistance gene analog markers to analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice.,"Plant disease resistance gene analog (RGA) markers were designed according to the conserved sequence of known RGAs and used to map resistance genes. We used genome-wide RGA markers for genetic analyses of structure and diversity in a global rice germplasm collection. Of the 472 RGA markers, 138 were polymorphic and these were applied to 178 entries selected from the USDA rice core collection. Results from the RGA markers were similar between two methods, UPGMA and STRUCTURE. Additionally, the results from RGA markers in our study were agreeable with those previously reported from SSR markers, including cluster of ancestral classification, genetic diversity estimates, genetic relatedness, and cluster of geographic origins. These results suggest that RGA markers are applicable for analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice. However, unlike SSR markers, the RGA markers failed to differentiate temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and aromatic subgroups. The restricted way for developing RGA markers from the cDNA sequence might limit the polymorphism of RGA markers in the genome, thus limiting the discriminatory power in comparison with SSR markers. Genetic differentiation obtained using RGA markers may be useful for defining genetic diversity of a suite of random R genes in plants, as many studies show a differentiation of resistance to a wide array of pathogens. They could also help to characterize the genetic structure and geographic distribution in crops, including rice, wheat, barley, and banana.",plant disease resistance gene analog rga marker designed according conserved sequence known rgas used map resistance gene used genomewide rga marker genetic analysis structure diversity global rice germplasm collection rga marker polymorphic applied entry selected usda rice core collection result rga marker similar two method upgma structure additionally result rga marker study agreeable previously reported ssr marker including cluster ancestral classification genetic diversity estimate genetic relatedness cluster geographic origin result suggest rga marker applicable analysis genetic structure diversity rice however unlike ssr marker rga marker failed differentiate temperate japonica tropical japonica aromatic subgroup restricted way developing rga marker cdna sequence might limit polymorphism rga marker genome thus limiting discriminatory power comparison ssr marker genetic differentiation obtained using rga marker may useful defining genetic diversity suite random r gene plant many study show differentiation resistance wide array pathogen could also help characterize genetic structure geographic distribution crop including rice wheat barley banana,1,"{'Disease': ['plant disease resistance gene analog rga marker'], 'Treatment': ['similar two method upgma structure'], 'Symptom': []}",4

19055443,Defective active silicon uptake affects some components of rice resistance to brown spot.,"Rice is known to accumulate high amounts of silicon (Si) in plant tissue, which helps to decrease the intensity of many economically important rice diseases. Among these diseases, brown spot, caused by the fungus Bipolaris oryzae, is one of the most devastating because it negatively affects yield and grain quality. This study aimed to evaluate the importance of active root Si uptake in rice for controlling brown spot development. Some components of host resistance were evaluated in a rice mutant, low silicon 1 (lsi1), defective in active Si uptake, and its wild-type counterpart (cv. Oochikara). Plants were inoculated with B. oryzae after growing for 35 days in a hydroponic culture amended with 0 or 2 mMol Si. The components of host resistance evaluated were incubation period (IP), relative infection efficiency (RIE), area under brown spot progress curve (AUBSPC), final lesion size (FLS), rate of lesion expansion (r), and area under lesion expansion progress curve (AULEPC). Si content from both Oochikara and lsi1 in the +Si treatment increased in leaf tissue by 219 and 178%, respectively, over the nonamended controls. Plants from Oochikara had 112% more Si in leaf tissue than plants from lsi1. The IP of brown spot from Oochikara increased approximately 6 h in the presence of Si and the RIE, AUBSPC, FLS, r, and AULEPC were significantly reduced by 65, 75, 33, 36, and 35%, respectively. In the presence of Si, the IP increased 3 h for lsi1 but the RIE, AUBSPC, FLS, r, and AULEPC were reduced by only 40, 50, 12, 21, and 12%, respectively. The correlation between Si leaf content and IP was significantly positive but Si content was negatively correlated with RIE, AUBSPC, FLS, r, and AULEPC. Single degree-of-freedom contrasts showed that Oochikara and lsi1 supplied with Si were significantly different from those not supplied with Si for all components of resistance evaluated. This result showed that a reduced Si content in tissues of plants from lsi1 dramatically affected its basal level of resistance to brown spot, suggesting that a minimum Si concentration is needed.

20626286,Identification of the quantitative trait loci in japonica rice landrace Heikezijing responsible for broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast.,"Rice blast is one of the most devastating diseases affecting rice production worldwide. One japonica landrace, Heikezijing, from the Taihu Lake area in China, has been reported to be highly resistant to most of the rice blast isolates collected from China and Japan. To effectively dissect the inheritance of its resistance, a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (F(2:8)) was constructed from a cross between Heikezijing and Suyunuo, a blast-susceptible cultivar. Nineteen blast isolates from China and Japan were inoculated into 166 RILs and their parents, and 22 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring resistance to these isolates were identified and mapped onto rice chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 11, and 12. Most of the QTLs conferred race-specific resistance to blast. Some QTLs, such as qtl11-5-5, conferred resistance to two or more isolates. One blast-resistant gene cluster, including qtl11-2-2, qtl11-3-1, qtl11-4-1, qtl11-5-5, qtl11-6-1, qtl11-7-5, qtl11-8-2, qtl11-9-2, qtl11-10-4, and qtl11-11-1, was found on the long arm of chromosome 11 in the japonica landrace. These loci offered effective resistance toward as many as 17 isolates, including 16 isolates from seven Chinese race groups and 1 isolate from Japan.

28191641,Genetic variation and host-parasite specificity of Striga resistance and tolerance in rice: the need for predictive breeding.,"The parasitic weeds Striga asiatica and Striga hermonthica cause devastating yield losses to upland rice in Africa. Little is known about genetic variation in host resistance and tolerance across rice genotypes, in relation to virulence differences across Striga species and ecotypes. Diverse rice genotypes were phenotyped for the above traits in S. asiatica- (Tanzania) and S. hermonthica-infested fields (Kenya and Uganda) and under controlled conditions. New rice genotypes with either ecotype-specific or broad-spectrum resistance were identified. Resistance identified in the field was confirmed under controlled conditions, providing evidence that resistance was largely genetically determined. Striga-resistant genotypes contributed to yield security under Striga-infested conditions, although grain yield was also determined by the genotype-specific yield potential and tolerance. Tolerance, the physiological mechanism mitigating Striga effects on host growth and physiology, was unrelated to resistance, implying that any combination of high, medium or low levels of these traits can be found across rice genotypes. Striga virulence varies across species and ecotypes. The extent of Striga-induced host damage results from the interaction between parasite virulence and genetically determined levels of host-plant resistance and tolerance. These novel findings support the need for predictive breeding strategies based on knowledge of host resistance and parasite virulence.",parasitic weed striga asiatica striga hermonthica cause devastating yield loss upland rice africa little known genetic variation host resistance tolerance across rice genotype relation virulence difference across striga specie ecotypes diverse rice genotype phenotyped trait asiatica tanzania hermonthicainfested field kenya uganda controlled condition new rice genotype either ecotypespecific broadspectrum resistance identified resistance identified field confirmed controlled condition providing evidence resistance largely genetically determined strigaresistant genotype contributed yield security strigainfested condition although grain yield also determined genotypespecific yield potential tolerance tolerance physiological mechanism mitigating striga effect host growth physiology unrelated resistance implying combination high medium low level trait found across rice genotype striga virulence varies across specie ecotypes extent strigainduced host damage result interaction parasite virulence genetically determined level hostplant resistance tolerance novel finding support need predictive breeding strategy based knowledge host resistance parasite virulence,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0

Genetic control through the identification of novel sources of bacterial blight resistance and their utilization in resistance breeding remains the most effective and economical strategy to manage the disease. Here we report the identification of a novel locus from the wild Oryza species, Oryza latifolia, conferring a race-specific resistance to Philippine Xoo race 9A (PXO339). The locus was identified from two introgression lines i.e. WH12-2252 and WH12-2256 that segregated from O. latifolia monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs). The discrete segregation ratio of susceptible and resistant phenotypes in the F2 (χ2[3:1] = 0.22 at p>0.05) and F3 (χ2[3:1] = 0.36 at p>0.05) populations indicates that PXO339 resistance in the MAAL-derived introgression lines (MDILs) is controlled by a single, recessive gene. Genotyping of a total of 216 F2, 1130 F3 and 288 F4 plants derived from crossing either of the MDILs with the recurrent parent used to generate the MAALs narrowed the candidate region to a 1,817 kb locus that extends from 10,425 to 12,266 kb in chromosome 12. Putative candidate genes that were identified by data mining and comparative sequence analysis can provide targets for further studies on mapping and cloning of the causal gene for PXO339 resistance in the MDILs.

Various proteins responsible for lesion mimics have been identified; however, the mechanisms underlying lesion formation and pathogen resistance are still unknown. Here, we identify a lesion mimic mutant in rice, lesion mimic leaf 1 (lml1). The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast. LML1 is expressed in all types of leaf cells, and encodes a novel eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein sequences of LML1 orthologs are conserved in yeast, animals and plants. LML1 can partially rescue the growth delay phenotype of the LML1 yeast ortholog mutant, dom34. Both lml1 and mutants of AtLML1 (the LML1 Arabidopsis ortholog) exhibited a growth delay phenotype like dom34. This indicates that LML1 and its orthologs are functionally conserved. LML1 forms a functional complex with a eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A)-like protein, SPL33/LMM5.1, whose mutant phenotype was similar to the lml1 phenotype.

To assess the function of the Rirlb gene in rice blast resistance, it was placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and transferred into rice plants of the japonica variety Taipei 309 by biolistic transformation of immature embryos. Two out of 12 hygromycin-resistant regenerated plants (OE1 and OE3) were fertile. DNA gel blot analysis suggested that these two T0 plants were independent transformants, each of which had stably incorporated one complete copy of the transgene into the genome. In addition, the OE1 plant appeared also a contain a rearranged copy or incomplete copy. T1 plants homozygous for the transgene were identified by DNA gel blot analysis of individual T2 progeny and further propagated. Expression analysis of the transgene showed that the transgene was active both in T1 plants and homozygous decendants.

Traditional irrigation methods used in rice farming often result in great water loss. New water-saving methods are urgently needed to reduce water consumption. Three field and pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the furrow irrigation (FI) system to improve water use efficiency (WUE) and production of direct sowing rice in southern China. Compared to the conventional irrigation (CI) system (continuous flooding irrigation), for every square hectometer of rice field, the FI system reduced water use by 3130 m3, or 48.1%, and increased grain production by 13.9% for an early cultivar. For a late cultivar, the FI system reduced water use by 2655 m3, or 40.6%, and an increase of grain production by 12.1%. The improved WUE in the FI system is attributed to (1) a significant reduction of irrigation rate, seepage, evaporation, and evapotranspiration; (2) a significant reduction in the reduced materials, such as ferrous ion (Fe2+), and therefore an increase in the vitality of the root system, evident by the increases in the number of white roots by 32.62%, and decreases in the number of black roots by 20.04% and yellow roots by 12.58%; the use of the FI system may also reduce humidity of the rice field and enhance gas transport in the soil and light penetration, which led to reduced rice diseases and increased leaf vitality; and (3) increases in tiller and effective spikes by 11.53% and the weight per thousand grains by 1.0 g.

24312331,Comparative proteomic analysis reveals the cross-talk between the responses induced by H2O2 and by long-term rice black-streaked dwarf virus infection in rice.,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) could be produced during the plant-virus compatible interaction. However, the cell responses regulated by the enhanced H2O2 in virus infected plant are largely unknown. To make clear the influence of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) infection on H2O2 accumulation, we measured the content of H2O2 and found the H2O2 level was increased in rice seedlings inoculated with RBSDV. To reveal the responses initiated by the enhanced H2O2 during plant-virus interaction, the present study investigated the global proteome changes of rice under long-term RBSDV infection. Approximately 1800 protein spots were detected on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) gels. Among them, 72 spots were found differently expressed, of which 69 spots were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Furthermore, the differentially expressed proteins induced by RBSDV infection were compared to that induced by H2O2. 19 proteins corresponding to 37 spots, which were differentially expressed under RBSDV infection, were observed differentially expressed under H2O2 stress as well. These overlapping responsive proteins are mainly related to photosynthesis, redox homeostasis, metabolism, energy pathway, and cell wall modification. The increased H2O2 in RBSDV infected plant may produce an oxidative stress, impair photosynthesis, disturb the metabolism, and eventually result in abnormal growth.

12955204,Molecular markers linked to the blast resistance gene Pi-z in rice for use in marker-assisted selection.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Pyricularia grisea, is a serious disease affecting rice-growing regions around the world. Current methods for identification of blast-resistant germplasm and progeny typically utilize phenotypic screening. However, phenotypic screens are influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of one resistance gene can sometimes phenotypically mask other genes conferring resistance to the same blast race. Pi-z is a dominant gene located on the short arm of chromosome 6 that confers complete resistance to five races of blast. Using sequence data found in public databases and degenerate primer pairs based on the P-loop, nucleotide binding sites and kinase domain motifs of previously cloned resistance genes, we have developed PCR-based DNA markers that cosegregate with the gene. These markers are polymorphic in a wide range of germplasm, including the narrow crosses characteristic of applied rice-breeding programs. They can now be used as a low cost, high-throughput alternative to conventional phenotypic screening for direct detection of blast resistance genes, allowing rapid introgression of genes into susceptible varieties as well as the incorporation of multiple genes into individual lines for more-durable blast resistance.",rice blast caused fungal pathogen pyricularia grisea serious disease affecting ricegrowing region around world current method identification blastresistant germplasm progeny typically utilize phenotypic screening however phenotypic screen influenced environmental condition presence one resistance gene sometimes phenotypically mask gene conferring resistance blast race piz dominant gene located short arm chromosome confers complete resistance five race blast using sequence data found public database degenerate primer pair based ploop nucleotide binding site kinase domain motif previously cloned resistance gene developed pcrbased dna marker cosegregate gene marker polymorphic wide range germplasm including narrow cross characteristic applied ricebreeding program used low cost highthroughput alternative conventional phenotypic screening direct detection blast resistance gene allowing rapid introgression gene susceptible variety well incorporation multiple gene individual line moredurable blast resistance,1,"{'Disease': ['fungal pathogen pyricularia grisea serious disease'], 'Treatment': ['world current method identification blastresistant germplasm progeny'], 'Symptom': []}",1
16832648,Genetic characterization and fine mapping of the blast resistance locus Pigm(t) tightly linked to Pi2 and Pi9 in a broad-spectrum resistant Chinese variety.,"The identification and utilization of broad-spectrum resistance genes have been proven the most effective and economical approach to control rice blast disease. To understand the molecular mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, we conducted genetic and fine mapping analysis of the blast resistance gene in a Chinese rice variety: Gumei 4 (GM4) identified with broad-spectrum resistance and used in rice breeding for blast resistance for more than 20 years. Genetic and mapping analysis indicated that blast resistance to nine isolates of different Chinese races in GM4 was controlled by the same dominant locus designated as Pigm(t) that was finely mapped to an approximately 70-kb interval between markers C5483 and C0428 on chromosome 6, which contains five candidate NBS--LRR disease resistance genes. The allelism test showed that Pigm(t) was either tightly linked or allelic to Pi2 and Pi9, two known blast resistance genes. Mapping information also indicated that another blast resistance gene Pi26(t) might also be located at the same region. Candidate genes were identified by sequence analysis of the Nipponbare and Pi9 locus and the corresponding region in GM4. Sequence divergence of candidate genes was observed between GM4 and model varieties Nipponbare and 9311, and Pi9.

Oxidative burst.,"Suspension cultured cells of six rice cultivars differing in their sensitivity to blast were treated with mycelial wall hydrolysates prepared from seven isolates belonging to different Pyricularia grisea lineages. Soon after elicitor addition, rice cells produced significant amounts of superoxide anion, which was rapidly converted into diffusible peroxide. Maximal effects were achieved at 50 mg L-1 elicitor. In all cases, a 7 to 13-fold increase in the basal rate of reactive oxygen species production was found. Neither differential effects among strains nor clear relationships between lineage and the resulting oxidative burst were evident. Interestingly, a good correlation was found between basal (and elicited) levels of peroxide generation and the overall tolerance of rice cultivars to the pathogen. About two days after elicitation, cell death occurred proportional to the amount of hydrogen peroxide released. Peroxide was required to trigger loss of cell viability, but the latter was not due to a direct toxic effect, suggesting the induction of programmed cell death.

21112065,Probing the role of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolism in defense responses against Bipolaris oryzae infection in rice leaves by a suicide substrate of tryptophan decarboxylase.,"Tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites, including serotonin and its hydroxycinnamic acid amides, markedly accumulate in rice leaves in response to pathogen attack. These compounds have been implicated in the physical defense system against pathogen invasion by being deposited in cell walls. Serotonin is biosynthesized from tryptophan via tryptamine, and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) catalyzes the first committed reaction. In this study, (S)-α-(fluoromethyl)tryptophan (S-αFMT) was utilized to investigate the effects of the inhibition of TDC on the defense responses of rice leaves. S-αFMT, enantiospecifically synthesized from L-tryptophan, effectively inhibited TDC activity extracted from rice leaves infected by Bipolaris oryzae. The inhibition rate increased dependently on the incubation time, indicating that S-αFMT served as a suicide substrate. Treatment of rice seedlings with S-αFMT suppressed accumulation of serotonin, tryptamine, and hydroxycinnamic acid amides of serotonin in a dose-dependent manner in B. oryzae-inoculated leaves. The lesions formed on seedlings treated with S-αFMT lacked deposition of brown materials, and those leaves were severely damaged in comparison with leaves without S-αFMT treatment. Administrating tryptamine to S-αFMT-treated leaves restored accumulation of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites as well as deposition of brown material. In addition, tryptamine administration reduced damage caused by fungal infection. Accordingly, the accumulation of tryptophan-derived secondary metabolites was suggested to be part of the effective defense mechanism of rice.",tryptophanderived secondary metabolite including serotonin hydroxycinnamic acid amide markedly accumulate rice leaf response pathogen attack compound implicated physical defense system pathogen invasion deposited cell wall serotonin biosynthesized tryptophan via tryptamine tryptophan decarboxylase tdc catalyzes first committed reaction study sαfluoromethyltryptophan sαfmt utilized investigate effect inhibition tdc defense response rice leaf sαfmt enantiospecifically synthesized ltryptophan effectively inhibited tdc activity extracted rice leaf infected bipolaris oryzae inhibition rate increased dependently incubation time indicating sαfmt served suicide substrate treatment rice seedling sαfmt suppressed accumulation serotonin tryptamine hydroxycinnamic acid amide serotonin dosedependent manner b oryzaeinoculated leaf lesion formed seedling treated sαfmt lacked deposition brown material leaf severely damaged comparison leaf without sαfmt treatment administrating tryptamine sαfmttreated leaf restored accumulation tryptophanderived secondary metabolite well deposition brown material addition tryptamine administration reduced damage caused fungal infection accordingly accumulation tryptophanderived secondary metabolite suggested part effective defense mechanism rice,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['suicide substrate treatment rice seedling sαfmt', 'treatment'], 'Symptom': ['ltryptophan effectively inhibited tdc activity', 'part effective defense mechanism rice']}",1
27249349,Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture.,"Global food security requires increased crop productivity to meet escalating demand(1-3). Current food production systems are heavily dependent on synthetic inputs that threaten the environment and human well-being(2,4,5). Biodiversity, for instance, is key to the provision of ecosystem services such as pest control(6,7), but is eroded in conventional agricultural systems. Yet the conservation and reinstatement of biodiversity is challenging(5,8,9), and it remains unclear whether the promotion of biodiversity can reduce reliance on inputs without penalizing yields on a regional scale. Here we present results from multi-site field studies replicated in Thailand, China and Vietnam over a period of four years, in which we grew nectar-producing plants around rice fields, and monitored levels of pest infestation, insecticide use and yields. Compiling the data from all sites, we report that this inexpensive intervention significantly reduced populations of two key pests, reduced insecticide applications by 70%, increased grain yields by 5% and delivered an economic advantage of 7.5%. Additional field studies showed that predators and parasitoids of the main rice pests, together with detritivores, were more abundant in the presence of nectar-producing plants.

23718837,Fine mapping and identification of blast resistance gene Pi-hk1 in a broad-spectrum resistant japonica rice landrace.,"One Japonica rice landrace, Heikezijing, from the Taihu Lake region of China, exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast.

To fine map Pi-hk1, one recombinant inbred line (RIL), RIL72 (F2:8), from the cross between Heikezijing and blast-susceptible variety Suyunuo, was further crossed and backcrossed with Suyunuo to produce a BC1F2 population of 477 individuals.

This study explores the effects of MT (0 and 200 mg/L) and six doses of fluroxypyr-meptyl (FLUME) (0-0.14 mg/L) on the physiological response of rice (Oryza sativa). FLUME exposure inhibited the growth of rice seedlings, with MT treatment ameliorating this effect. To determine the biochemical processes and catalytic events involved in FLUME breakdown in rice, six rice root and shoot libraries exposed to either FLUME or FLUME-MT were generated and then subjected to RNA-Seq-LC-Q-TOF-HRMS/MS analyses. The results showed that 1510 root genes and 139 shoot genes exhibited higher upregulation in plants treated with an ecologically realistic FLUME concentration and MT than in those treated with FLUME alone. Gene enrichment analysis revealed numerous FLUME-degradative enzymes operating in xenobiotic tolerance to environmental stress and molecular metabolism. Regarding the FLUME degradation process, certain differentially expressed genes were responsible for producing important enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, glycosyltransferases, and acetyltransferases. Four metabolites and ten conjugates in the pathways involving hydrolysis, malonylation, reduction, glycosylation, or acetylation were characterized using LC-Q-TOF-HRMS/MS to support FLUME-degradative metabolism. Overall, external application of MT can increase rice tolerance to FLUME-induced oxidative stress by reducing phytotoxicity and FLUME accumulation.

25532750,Chromosomal locations of a gene underlying heat-accelerated brown spot formation and its suppressor genes in rice.,"Brown spots on mature leaves from the heading to ripening stages in rice are considered to be lesions induced by heat stress. However, there are few studies of lesions that are induced by heat stress rather than by pathogen infections. To understand the genetic background underlying such lesions, we used the chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) SL518, derived from a distant cross between rice cultivars Koshihikari (japonica) and Nona Bokra (indica). We observed brown spots on mature leaf blades of the CSSL, although the parents barely showed any spots. Spot formation in SL518 was accelerated by high temperature, suggesting that the candidate gene for spot formation is related to heat stress response. Using progeny derived from a cross between SL518 and Koshihikari, we mapped the causative gene, BROWN-SPOTTED LEAF 1 (BSPL1), on chromosome 5. We speculated that one or more Nona Bokra genes suppress spot formation caused by BSPL1 and identified candidate genomic regions on chromosomes 2 and 9 using a cross between a near-isogenic line for BSPL1 and other CSSLs possessing Nona Bokra segments in the Koshihikari genetic background. In conclusion, our data support the concept that multiple genes are complementarily involved in brown spot formation induced by heat stress and will be useful for cloning of the novel gene(s) related to the spot formation.",brown spot mature leaf heading ripening stage rice considered lesion induced heat stress however study lesion induced heat stress rather pathogen infection understand genetic background underlying lesion used chromosome segment substitution line cssl sl derived distant cross rice cultivar koshihikari japonica nona bokra indica observed brown spot mature leaf blade cssl although parent barely showed spot spot formation sl accelerated high temperature suggesting candidate gene spot formation related heat stress response using progeny derived cross sl koshihikari mapped causative gene brownspotted leaf bspl chromosome speculated one nona bokra gene suppress spot formation caused bspl identified candidate genomic region chromosome using cross nearisogenic line bspl cssls possessing nona bokra segment koshihikari genetic background conclusion data support concept multiple gene complementarily involved brown spot formation induced heat stress useful cloning novel gene related spot formation,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
26239726,The complete genome sequence of Dickeya zeae EC1 reveals substantial divergence from other Dickeya strains and species.,"Dickeya zeae is a bacterial species that infects monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Two antibiotic-like phytotoxins named zeamine and zeamine II were reported to play an important role in rice seed germination, and two genes associated with zeamines production, i.e., zmsA and zmsK, have been thoroughly characterized. However, other virulence factors and its molecular mechanisms of host specificity and pathogenesis are hardly known. The complete genome of D. zeae strain EC1 isolated from diseased rice plants was sequenced, annotated, and compared with the genomes of other Dickeya spp.. The pathogen contains a chromosome of 4,532,364 bp with 4,154 predicted protein-coding genes. Comparative genomics analysis indicates that D. zeae EC1 is most co-linear with D. chrysanthemi Ech1591, most conserved with D. zeae Ech586 and least similar to D. paradisiaca Ech703. Substantial genomic rearrangement was revealed by comparing EC1 with Ech586 and Ech703. Most virulence genes were well-conserved in Dickeya strains except Ech703. Significantly, the zms gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of zeamines, which were shown previously as key virulence determinants, is present in D. zeae strains isolated from rice, and some D. solani strains, but absent in other Dickeya species and the D. zeae strains isolated from other plants or sources. In addition, a DNA fragment containing 9 genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis was found inserted in the fli gene cluster encoding flagellar biosynthesis of strain EC1 and other two rice isolates but not in other strains. This gene cluster shares a high protein similarity to the fatty acid genes from Pantoea ananatis. Our findings delineate the genetic background of D. zeae EC1, which infects both dicotyledons and monocotyledons, and suggest that D. zeae strains isolated from rice could be grouped into a distinct pathovar, i.e., D. zeae subsp. oryzae. In addition, the results of this study also unveiled that the zms gene cluster presented in the genomes of D. zeae rice isolates and D. solani strains, and the fatty acid genes inserted in the fli gene cluster of strain EC1 were likely derived from horizontal gene transfer during later stage of bacterial evolution.",dickeya zeae bacterial specie infects monocotyledon dicotyledon two antibioticlike phytotoxin named zeamine zeamine ii reported play important role rice seed germination two gene associated zeamines production ie zmsa zmsk thoroughly characterized however virulence factor molecular mechanism host specificity pathogenesis hardly known complete genome zeae strain ec isolated diseased rice plant sequenced annotated compared genome dickeya spp pathogen contains chromosome bp predicted proteincoding gene comparative genomics analysis indicates zeae ec colinear chrysanthemi ech conserved zeae ech least similar paradisiaca ech substantial genomic rearrangement revealed comparing ec ech ech virulence gene wellconserved dickeya strain except ech significantly zms gene cluster involved biosynthesis zeamines shown previously key virulence determinant present zeae strain isolated rice solani strain absent dickeya specie zeae strain isolated plant source addition dna fragment containing gene associated fatty acid biosynthesis found inserted fli gene cluster encoding flagellar biosynthesis strain ec two rice isolates strain gene cluster share high protein similarity fatty acid gene pantoea ananatis finding delineate genetic background zeae ec infects dicotyledon monocotyledon suggest zeae strain isolated rice could grouped distinct pathovar ie zeae subsp oryzae addition result study also unveiled zms gene cluster presented genome zeae rice isolates solani strain fatty acid gene inserted fli gene cluster strain ec likely derived horizontal gene transfer later stage bacterial evolution,2,"{'Disease': ['complete genome zeae strain ec isolated diseased rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
20544229,Optimizing tillage schedule for maintaining activity of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal population in a rainfed upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) agro-ecosystem.,"Rainfed uplands in India are predominantly mono-cropped with rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the wet season (June/July to September/October) and grown under aerobic soil conditions. The remaining fallow period (winter followed by summer) of about 8-9 months leads to natural crash in the population of native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the soil. Attempts have been made to minimize this population crash by reducing soil disturbance-induced deleterious effects on native AMF activity of improperly scheduled off-season tillage, an agronomic recommendation for weed and disease (soil-borne) management, practiced by the upland farmers. On-farm (farmers' field) evaluation of effects of all suitable off-season tillage schedule combinations on rice during wet seasons of 2004, 2005, and 2006 revealed that a maximum of two off-season tillage schedules with a minimum gap of 13 weeks between them minimized the population crash of native AMF with a concomitant increase in phosphorus (P) uptake and grain yield of upland rice (variety ""Vandana"").",rainfed upland india predominantly monocropped rice oryza sativa l wet season junejuly septemberoctober grown aerobic soil condition remaining fallow period winter followed summer month lead natural crash population native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf soil attempt made minimize population crash reducing soil disturbanceinduced deleterious effect native amf activity improperly scheduled offseason tillage agronomic recommendation weed disease soilborne management practiced upland farmer onfarm farmer field evaluation effect suitable offseason tillage schedule combination rice wet season revealed maximum two offseason tillage schedule minimum gap week minimized population crash native amf concomitant increase phosphorus p uptake grain yield upland rice variety vandana,2,"{'Disease': ['offseason tillage agronomic recommendation weed disease soilborne management'], 'Treatment': ['offseason tillage agronomic recommendation weed disease soilborne management'], 'Symptom': ['deleterious effect native amf activity', 'upland farmer onfarm farmer field evaluation effect']}",1
22137607,Two phenylalanine ammonia lyase isoforms are involved in the elicitor-induced response of rice to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Suspension cultured cells of a blast-resistant rice genotype (Oryza sativa L. cv. Gigante Vercelli) were treated with cell wall hydrolysates prepared from the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. As a consequence, a complex pattern of phenylalanine ammonia lyase time course specific activity levels was evident. Ion-exchange chromatographic fractionation of crude extracts suggested that the early (6 h) and the late (48-72 h after elicitation) increase of activity relied upon the sequential induction of two different isoenzymes. The relative expression levels of 11 genes putatively coding for a phenylalanine ammonia lyase were measured by semi-quantitative capillary gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products. Two genes were indeed found to be induced by treatments with the hydrolysate, and data were validated by real-time PCR. Conversely, only the early-responsive enzyme form was observed following elicitation in a blast-sensitive rice genotype (cv. Vialone nano). Therefore, the late-responsive isoform may represent a candidate gene to select for decreased sensitivity to blast.",suspension cultured cell blastresistant rice genotype oryza sativa l cv gigante vercelli treated cell wall hydrolysate prepared fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae consequence complex pattern phenylalanine ammonia lyase time course specific activity level evident ionexchange chromatographic fractionation crude extract suggested early h late h elicitation increase activity relied upon sequential induction two different isoenzymes relative expression level gene putatively coding phenylalanine ammonia lyase measured semiquantitative capillary gel electrophoresis rtpcr product two gene indeed found induced treatment hydrolysate data validated realtime pcr conversely earlyresponsive enzyme form observed following elicitation blastsensitive rice genotype cv vialone nano therefore lateresponsive isoform may represent candidate gene select decreased sensitivity blast,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['induced treatment hydrolysate data'], 'Symptom': []}",1
16011032,[Identification and marker-assisted selection of two major quantitative genes controlling rice sheath blight resistance in backcross generations].,"We constructed an F2 clonal population of intercross,Teqing/Lemont, and identified two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contributing to rice sheath blight resistance on chromosome 9 and 11. The two QTLs were qSB-9 and qSB-11, respectively. From the population, three clonal lines were selected by markers' band types on both sides of these two QTLs, qSB-9 and qSB-11. Two were double-susceptible parent with homozygous susceptible alleles of these two loci,and the other was named as double-resistant parent,of which these two loci were all homozygous resistant alleles. These parents were separately backcrossed to recurrent parents, Teqing or Lemont. From BC2F1, marker-assisted selection was conducted in each proceeding generation and all back-crossed plants in BC2F1 and BC4F1 were inoculated by short toothpicks incubated with a strain, RH-9 of the fungus for identification of the resistance. Results suggested that these two QTLs were selected effectively in each backcross generation and their positions were also verified in identification of resistance to rice sheath blight. In seedling nursery of BC3F2 population, plants were selected through marker-assisted selection, and were separately mixed as homozygous lines of double-susceptible alleles on the background of Teqing, double-susceptible and double-resistant on the background of Lemont. The homozygous lines and their recurrent parents were simultaneously planted on experiment fields of Agriculture Collage of Yangzhou University and Lixiahe District Institute of Agricultural Science. The inoculation was performed by a random-block test with two replicates at each site. The results indicated that 1) The difference of sheath blight disease development was highly significant among materials under the same genetic background,and the order of disease seriousness among different homozygous lines were: double-susceptible line on the background of Lemont > double-susceptible line on the background of Teqing > Lemont > Teqing > double-resistant line on the background of Lemont; 2) When the resistant allele of qSB-9 or qSB-11 solely existed in a plant, its disease rating was reduced about 1.2 score, and 2.0 score when they simultaneously existed on the background of Lemont; 3) No significant interaction between the two QTLs controlling sheath blight resistance and environments was found.

16018181,Genetic dissections of partial resistances to leaf and neck blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"In a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of indica rice, two subpopulations composed of susceptible lines were selected for mapping of partial resistance to leaf blast with two isolates of the pathogen. A third subpopulation composed of susceptible lines with similar heading time was used for mapping of partial resistance to neck blast with a third isolate. The traits measured for partial resistance included diseased leaf area (DLA), lesion size (LS) and lesion number (LN) for leaf blast and lesion length (LL) and conidium amount (CA) for neck blast. A linkage map consisting of 168 DNA markers was constructed by using the whole RIL population. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conditioning these traits were determined at one-locus and two-locus levels. Eleven main-effect QTLs and 28 digenic interactions were detected by QTLMapper 1.01 b. Only three QTLs showing main effects were also involved in digenic interactions for the same trait. General contributions of epistatic QTLs of each trait ranged from 16.0% to 51.7%, while those of main-effect QTLs of each trait ranged from 4.7% to 38.8%. The general contributions of main-effect QTLs of most traits were smaller than those of epistatic QTLs, confirming the importance of epistasis as the genetic basis for complex traits. The general contributions of the main and epistatic effects of all QTLs detected for the two traits LL and CA of the partial resistance to neck blast reached 70.6% and 82.6% respectively, which obviously represented a major part of the genetic basis controlling partial resistance to neck blast.

26708413,Polarized Defense Against Fungal Pathogens Is Mediated by the Jacalin-Related Lectin Domain of Modular Poaceae-Specific Proteins.,"Modular proteins are an evolutionary answer to optimize performance of proteins that physically interact with each other for functionality. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments, we characterized the rice protein OsJAC1, which consists of a jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domain predicted to bind mannose-containing oligosaccharides, and a dirigent domain which might function in stereoselective coupling of monolignols. Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi. Overexpression of this gene or its wheat ortholog TAJA1 in barley enhanced resistance against the powdery mildew fungus. Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains. Expression of artificially separated and fluorescence-tagged protein domains showed that the JRL domain is sufficient for targeting the powdery mildew penetration site. Nevertheless, co-localization of the lectin and the dirigent domain occurred. Phylogenetic analyses revealed orthologs of OsJAC1 exclusively within the Poaceae plant family. Dicots, by contrast, only contain proteins with either JRL or dirigent domain(s). Altogether, our results identify OsJAC1 as a representative of a novel type of resistance protein derived from a plant lineage-specific gene fusion event for better function in local pathogen defense.",modular protein evolutionary answer optimize performance protein physically interact functionality using combination genetic biochemical experiment characterized rice protein osjac consists jacalinrelated lectin jrl domain predicted bind mannosecontaining oligosaccharide dirigent domain might function stereoselective coupling monolignols transgenic overexpression osjac rice resulted quantitative broadspectrum resistance different pathogen including bacteria oomycetes fungi overexpression gene wheat ortholog taja barley enhanced resistance powdery mildew fungus protein domain osjac required establish resistance indicated single combined transient expression individual domain expression artificially separated fluorescencetagged protein domain showed jrl domain sufficient targeting powdery mildew penetration site nevertheless colocalization lectin dirigent domain occurred phylogenetic analysis revealed orthologs osjac exclusively within poaceae plant family dicot contrast contain protein either jrl dirigent domain altogether result identify osjac representative novel type resistance protein derived plant lineagespecific gene fusion event better function local pathogen defense,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
18459427,Categories and inheritance of resistance to Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) in mutants of indica rice 'IR64'.,"Varietal mutants can be useful for developing durable resistance, understanding categories of resistance, and identifying candidate genes involved in defense responses. We used mutants of rice 'IR64' to isolate new sources of resistance to the planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). We compared two mutants that showed a gain and loss of resistance to N. lugens, to determine the categories of resistance to this pest. Under choice tests, female planthoppers avoided settling and laid fewer eggs on the resistant mutant 'D518' than on the susceptible mutant D1131, susceptible check 'TN1', and wild-type IR64, indicating that antixenosis was the resistance category. Similarly, under no-choice conditions, planthoppers laid 29% fewer eggs in D518 than in IR64, but they oviposited more in 'D1131' and TN1. Honeydew excretion was greater on D1131 seedlings but slightly lower on D518 than on IR64. Nymphal survival and adult female weight did not differ among rice cultivars. D518 showed higher tolerance of N. lugens infestations than IR64. Genetic analysis of the F1, F2, and F3 populations derived from D518 x IR64 revealed that resistance in D518 is dominant and controlled by a single gene. Despite the variation in resistance to N. lugens, both mutants and IR64 performed similarly in the field. The mutant D518 is a new source of durable resistance to N. lugens, mainly due to enhanced antixenosis to female hoppers for settling and oviposition.",varietal mutant useful developing durable resistance understanding category resistance identifying candidate gene involved defense response used mutant rice ir isolate new source resistance planthopper nilaparvata lugens stål hemiptera delphacidae compared two mutant showed gain loss resistance n lugens determine category resistance pest choice test female planthopper avoided settling laid fewer egg resistant mutant susceptible mutant susceptible check tn wildtype ir indicating antixenosis resistance category similarly nochoice condition planthopper laid fewer egg ir oviposited tn honeydew excretion greater seedling slightly lower ir nymphal survival adult female weight differ among rice cultivar showed higher tolerance n lugens infestation ir genetic analysis f f f population derived x ir revealed resistance dominant controlled single gene despite variation resistance n lugens mutant ir performed similarly field mutant new source durable resistance n lugens mainly due enhanced antixenosis female hopper settling oviposition,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
24757773,Genetic analysis of resistance to blast in the Vietnamese rice cultivar 'Chiembac'.,"The resistance to rice blast disease in the Vietnamese traditional rice cultivar 'Chiembac' was studied. The blast resistance spectrum in 'Chiembac' and 15 rice differentials carrying different known resistance genes was identified using 25 Pyricularia grisea isolates derived from 15 AFLP lineages from the North, Center and South of Vietnam. None of the differential lines carrying a single resistance gene could effectively control all tested Vietnamese blast isolates. 'Chiembac' showed a different resistance pattern compared to that of the differential lines. A cross between 'Chiembac' and 'CR203', an improved rice cultivar, was made and the F2 population was used for characterization and mapping of the resistance genes in 'Chiembac'. Genetic analysis showed that the resistance against two representative isolates from two predominant lineages, VT7 and 12, in 'Chiembac' was controlled by the single dominant genes Pi-VT7 and Pi-I2. The resistance gene Pi-VT7 was closely linked to Pi-I2 and was mapped to chromosome 12 using the framework mapping population 'IR64' x 'Azucena' of 124 double haploid progenies. The resistance to the Vietnamese blast isolate VT7 in 'IR64' was also studied. The latter was controlled by one locus with major effect located on chromosome 12 and mapped closely to the AFLP marker NIN080, which was also tightly linked to the resistance gene Pi-VT7 in 'Chiembac'.

15473325,[Mapping of a new resistance gene to bacterial blight in rice line introgressed from Oryza officinalis].,"Rice line 'B5', which was derived from the wild rice Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt through introgression, has been proved to be high resistant to brown planthopper, whitebacked planthopper and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). In this study, the resistance to bacterial blight of 187 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between ' B5' and 'Minghui63' were evaluated and RFLP markers linked to the resistance gene were identified by bulked segregant analysis. Analysis of the molecular marker linkage map and the data of the lesion length of RILs located the resistant gene within a 1. 3 cM region flanked by RFLP markers C904 and R596 on chromosome 1. This locus contributed to 52.96% of the phenotypic variance of resistance in the population, and is considered to be a new locus as compared with other resistant genes to bacterial blight that have been reported. We tentatively designate this gene as Xa29(t). This newly tagged gene introgressed from wild rice is valuable to molecular marker-assisted selection for multiple resistant materials in rice breeding programme. Furthermore, it provides information for cloning the resistant gene Xa29(t) in rice.",rice line b derived wild rice oryza officinalis wall ex watt introgression proved high resistant brown planthopper whitebacked planthopper bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae study resistance bacterial blight recombinant inbred line rils cross b minghui evaluated rflp marker linked resistance gene identified bulked segregant analysis analysis molecular marker linkage map data lesion length rils located resistant gene within cm region flanked rflp marker c r chromosome locus contributed phenotypic variance resistance population considered new locus compared resistant gene bacterial blight reported tentatively designate gene xat newly tagged gene introgressed wild rice valuable molecular markerassisted selection multiple resistant material rice breeding programme furthermore provides information cloning resistant gene xat rice,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
17905716,[Genetic analysis of resistance to rice blast in four Japonica landraces from Taihu Lake region].,"The crosses were made between four japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) landraces Bodao, Tieganqing, Jiangnanwan and Queernuo from Taihu Lake region, which were highly resistant to the blast (Magnaporthe grisa), and a susceptible japonica variety Suyunuo to produce F1 and F2 generations. The P1 , P2, F1 and F2 generation from various combinations were inoculated separately with Japanese blast strain Hoku 1 and Chinese races ZE3 and ZG1 to study genetic patterns of resis-tance in the four landraces to the blast. Resistance in Bodao, Tieganqing or Queernuo to blast Hoku 1 might be controlled by a dominant gene, and in Jiangnanwan by two inhibiting effect genes. Resistance in Tieganqing or Queernuo to blast ZE3 might be controlled by one dominant gene, and in Bodao and Jiangnanwan by two independently dominant genes and two inhibiting effect genes, respectively. Resistance in Tieganqing to blast ZG1 might be controlled by a dominant gene, but in Bodao and Jiangnanwan by two inhibiting effect genes. The crosses were further made between landrace Bodao and 12 Japanese differential varieties possessing the known resistance genes to the blast to produce F1 and F2 generations. The plants of various generations were inoculated with strain Hoku 1 to confirm the resistance gene in Bodao was allelic with known resistance genes. The results show that the resistance gene in Bodao to strain Hoku 1 was non allelic with known resistance genes, and tentatively designated Pi-bd1(t).",cross made four japonica rice oryza sativa l landraces bodao tieganqing jiangnanwan queernuo taihu lake region highly resistant blast magnaporthe grisa susceptible japonica variety suyunuo produce f f generation p p f f generation various combination inoculated separately japanese blast strain hoku chinese race ze zg study genetic pattern resistance four landraces blast resistance bodao tieganqing queernuo blast hoku might controlled dominant gene jiangnanwan two inhibiting effect gene resistance tieganqing queernuo blast ze might controlled one dominant gene bodao jiangnanwan two independently dominant gene two inhibiting effect gene respectively resistance tieganqing blast zg might controlled dominant gene bodao jiangnanwan two inhibiting effect gene cross made landrace bodao japanese differential variety possessing known resistance gene blast produce f f generation plant various generation inoculated strain hoku confirm resistance gene bodao allelic known resistance gene result show resistance gene bodao strain hoku non allelic known resistance gene tentatively designated pibdt,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['two inhibiting effect gene resistance', 'two independently dominant gene two inhibiting effect gene', 'two inhibiting effect gene cross']}",1
25136671,The role of antioxidant enzymes in adaptive responses to sheath blight infestation under different fertilization rates and hill densities.,"Sheath blight of rice, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide. No rice cultivar has been found to be completely resistant to this fungus. Identifying antioxidant enzymes activities (activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)) and malondialdehyde content (MDA) responding to sheath blight infestation is imperative to understand the defensive mechanism systems of rice. In the present study, two inoculation methods (toothpick and agar block method) were tested in double-season rice. Toothpick method had greater lesion length than agar block method in late season. A higher MDA content was found under toothpick method compared with agar block method, which led to greater POD and SOD activities. Dense planting caused higher lesion length resulting in a higher MDA content, which also subsequently stimulated higher POD and SOD activity. Sheath blight severity was significantly related to the activity of antioxidant enzyme during both seasons. The present study implies that rice plants possess a system of antioxidant protective enzymes which helps them in adaptation to sheath blight infection stresses. Several agronomic practices, such as rational use of fertilizers and optimum planting density, involved in regulating antioxidant protective enzyme systems can be regarded as promising strategy to suppress the sheath blight development.",sheath blight rice caused rhizoctonia solani one devastating rice disease worldwide rice cultivar found completely resistant fungus identifying antioxidant enzyme activity activity superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod catalase cat malondialdehyde content mda responding sheath blight infestation imperative understand defensive mechanism system rice present study two inoculation method toothpick agar block method tested doubleseason rice toothpick method greater lesion length agar block method late season higher mda content found toothpick method compared agar block method led greater pod sod activity dense planting caused higher lesion length resulting higher mda content also subsequently stimulated higher pod sod activity sheath blight severity significantly related activity antioxidant enzyme season present study implies rice plant possess system antioxidant protective enzyme help adaptation sheath blight infection stress several agronomic practice rational use fertilizer optimum planting density involved regulating antioxidant protective enzyme system regarded promising strategy suppress sheath blight development,2,"{'Disease': ['one devastating rice disease', 'completely resistant fungus identifying antioxidant enzyme activity activity superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod catalase cat malondialdehyde content mda'], 'Treatment': ['sheath blight infestation imperative understand defensive mechanism system rice present study two inoculation method toothpick agar block method', 'doubleseason rice toothpick method greater lesion length agar block method late season higher mda content', 'toothpick method', 'agar block method'], 'Symptom': []}",2

We conducted a retrospective cohort study among the kindergarten children and personnel who participated in the trip. The overall attack rate among the 155 participants was 30%. It was 31% among the 137 children (aged two to six years) and 17% among adults (n=18). The consumption of rice pudding was significantly associated with disease. Among those who ate rice pudding, the attack rate was 36%, compared with 0% for non-eaters (relative risk: infinite, p<0.001, aetiological fraction: 100%), but differed significantly between kindergartens A (43%), B (61%) and C (3%), probably because groups were served from different pots. Bacillus cereus sensu stricto was identified from one vomit sample. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics suggest that B. cereus emetic toxin (cereulide) was the causative agent, although it could not be proven in the single vomit isolate. Inadequate food handling most probably led to the outbreak.

16262065,[Effects of fungicide on temporal and spatial niches of Rhizoctonia solani].,"This paper studied the variation of the temporal and spatial niches of rice sheath blight-causing Rhizoctonia solani under spraying fungicide. The results showed that between fungicide treatments and control, the spatial niche breadth of Rhizoctonia solani was different, while its temporal niche breadth was similar. The spatial niche breadth of Rhizoctonia solani was 0.5240 when spraying fungicide at booting and full heading stages, 0.5742 at booting and milkfilling stages, and 0.8577 at tillering stage, while the control was 0.8563. Spraying fungicide had little effect on temporal niche breath. The spatial niche breath, percentage of diseased leaves and sheathes, index of disease, and control effect all suggested that spraying fungicide two times in rice growth period was better than spraying it one time. Spraying fungicide at booting and full heading stages and at booting stage and milkfilling stages had the best effects. Fungicide could not only narrow the spatial niche breadth, limit the spread of Rhizoctonia solani on top leaves which were important for the yield, but also narrow the temporal niche breadth, limit the spread of Rhizoctonia solani during the yield formation period of rice. But, spraying fungicide only changed the distribution of the fungus niches and narrowed the niches during rice yield formation period, with no changes in the whole niches of Rhizoctonia solani.",paper studied variation temporal spatial niche rice sheath blightcausing rhizoctonia solani spraying fungicide result showed fungicide treatment control spatial niche breadth rhizoctonia solani different temporal niche breadth similar spatial niche breadth rhizoctonia solani spraying fungicide booting full heading stage booting milkfilling stage tillering stage control spraying fungicide little effect temporal niche breath spatial niche breath percentage diseased leaf sheathes index disease control effect suggested spraying fungicide two time rice growth period better spraying one time spraying fungicide booting full heading stage booting stage milkfilling stage best effect fungicide could narrow spatial niche breadth limit spread rhizoctonia solani top leaf important yield also narrow temporal niche breadth limit spread rhizoctonia solani yield formation period rice spraying fungicide changed distribution fungus niche narrowed niche rice yield formation period change whole niche rhizoctonia solani,2,"{'Disease': ['temporal niche breath spatial niche breath percentage diseased leaf sheathes index disease control effect', 'changed distribution fungus niche'], 'Treatment': ['treatment control'], 'Symptom': ['little effect', 'temporal niche breath spatial niche breath percentage diseased leaf sheathes index disease control effect', 'milkfilling stage best effect']}",0
