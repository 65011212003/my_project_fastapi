23184051,Blast resistance in rice: a review of conventional breeding to molecular approaches.,"Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is the most severe diseases of rice. Using classical plant breeding techniques, breeders have developed a number of blast resistant cultivars adapted to different rice growing regions worldwide. However, the rice industry remains threatened by blast disease due to the instability of blast fungus. Recent advances in rice genomics provide additional tools for plant breeders to improve rice production systems that would be environmentally friendly. This article outlines the application of conventional breeding, tissue culture and DNA-based markers that are used for accelerating the development of blast resistant rice cultivars. The best way for controlling the disease is to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative genes in resistant variety. Through conventional and molecular breeding many blast-resistant varieties have been developed. Conventional breeding for disease resistance is tedious, time consuming and mostly dependent on environment as compare to molecular breeding particularly marker assisted selection, which is easier, highly efficient and precise. For effective management of blast disease, breeding work should be focused on utilizing the broad spectrum of resistance genes and pyramiding genes and quantitative trait loci. Marker assisted selection provides potential solution to some of the problems that conventional breeding cannot resolve. In recent years, blast resistant genes have introgressed into Luhui 17, G46B, Zhenshan 97B, Jin 23B, CO39, IR50, Pusa1602 and Pusa1603 lines through marker assisted selection. Introduction of exotic genes for resistance induced the occurrence of new races of blast fungus, therefore breeding work should be concentrated in local resistance genes. This review focuses on the conventional breeding to the latest molecular progress in blast disease resistance in rice. This update information will be helpful guidance for rice breeders to develop durable blast resistant rice variety through marker assisted selection.",blast disease caused fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae severe disease rice using classical plant breeding technique breeder developed number blast resistant cultivar adapted different rice growing region worldwide however rice industry remains threatened blast disease due instability blast fungus recent advance rice genomics provide additional tool plant breeder improve rice production system would environmentally friendly article outline application conventional breeding tissue culture dnabased marker used accelerating development blast resistant rice cultivar best way controlling disease incorporate qualitative quantitative gene resistant variety conventional molecular breeding many blastresistant variety developed conventional breeding disease resistance tedious time consuming mostly dependent environment compare molecular breeding particularly marker assisted selection easier highly efficient precise effective management blast disease breeding work focused utilizing broad spectrum resistance gene pyramiding gene quantitative trait locus marker assisted selection provides potential solution problem conventional breeding resolve recent year blast resistant gene introgressed luhui gb zhenshan b jin b co ir pusa pusa line marker assisted selection introduction exotic gene resistance induced occurrence new race blast fungus therefore breeding work concentrated local resistance gene review focus conventional breeding latest molecular progress blast disease resistance rice update information helpful guidance rice breeder develop durable blast resistant rice variety marker assisted selection,2,"{'Disease': ['blast disease', 'magnaporthe oryzae severe disease rice', 'threatened blast disease due instability blast fungus', 'controlling disease', 'conventional breeding disease resistance', 'easier highly efficient precise effective management blast disease breeding work', 'occurrence new race blast fungus', 'conventional breeding latest molecular progress blast disease resistance rice update information'], 'Treatment': ['easier highly efficient precise effective management blast disease breeding work'], 'Symptom': ['easier highly efficient precise effective management blast disease breeding work']}",13
34769087,Recent Progress in Rice Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance.,"Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world. However, stable rice production is constrained by various diseases, in particular rice blast, sheath blight, bacterial blight, and virus diseases. Breeding and cultivation of resistant rice varieties is the most effective method to control the infection of pathogens. Exploitation and utilization of the genetic determinants of broad-spectrum resistance represent a desired way to improve the resistance of susceptible rice varieties. Recently, researchers have focused on the identification of rice broad-spectrum disease resistance genes, which include <i>R</i> genes, defense-regulator genes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) against two or more pathogen species or many isolates of the same pathogen species. The cloning of broad-spectrum disease resistance genes and understanding their underlying mechanisms not only provide new genetic resources for breeding broad-spectrum rice varieties, but also promote the development of new disease resistance breeding strategies, such as editing susceptibility and executor <i>R</i> genes. In this review, the most recent advances in the identification of broad-spectrum disease resistance genes in rice and their application in crop improvement through biotechnology approaches during the past 10 years are summarized.",rice one important food crop world however stable rice production constrained various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance represent desired way improve resistance susceptible rice variety recently researcher focused identification rice broadspectrum disease resistance gene include iri gene defenseregulator gene quantitative trait locus qtl two pathogen specie many isolates pathogen specie cloning broadspectrum disease resistance gene understanding underlying mechanism provide new genetic resource breeding broadspectrum rice variety also promote development new disease resistance breeding strategy editing susceptibility executor iri gene review recent advance identification broadspectrum disease resistance gene rice application crop improvement biotechnology approach past year summarized,2,"{'Disease': ['various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance', 'resistance susceptible rice variety recently researcher focused identification rice broadspectrum disease resistance gene', 'broadspectrum disease resistance gene'], 'Treatment': ['various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance'], 'Symptom': ['various disease particular rice blast sheath blight bacterial blight virus disease breeding cultivation resistant rice variety effective method control infection pathogen exploitation utilization genetic determinant broadspectrum resistance']}",13
34890109,Engineering of rice varieties with enhanced resistances to both blast and bacterial blight diseases via CRISPR/Cas9.,"Rice blast and bacterial blight represent two of major diseases having devastating impact on the yield of rice in most rice-growing countries. Developments of resistant cultivars are the most economic and effective strategy to control these diseases. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to rapidly install mutations in three known broad-spectrum blast-resistant genes, Bsr-d1, Pi21 and ERF922, in an indica thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) rice line Longke638S (LK638S). We obtained transgene-free homozygous single or triple mutants in T<sub>1</sub> generations. While all single and triple mutants showed increased resistance to rice blast compared with wild type, the erf922 mutants displayed the strongest blast resistance similar with triple mutants. Surprisingly, we found that Pi21 or ERF922 single mutants conferred enhanced resistance to most of tested bacterial blight. Both resistances in mutants were attribute to the up-regulation of SA- and JA-pathway associated genes. Moreover, phenotypic analysis of these single mutants in paddy fields revealed that there were no trade-offs between resistances and main agricultural traits. Together, our study provides a rapid and effective way to generate rice varieties with resistance to both rice blast and bacterial blight.",rice blast bacterial blight represent two major disease devastating impact yield rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease used crisprcasmediated gene editing rapidly install mutation three known broadspectrum blastresistant gene bsrd pi erf indica thermosensitive genic male sterile tgms rice line longkes lks obtained transgenefree homozygous single triple mutant tsubsub generation single triple mutant showed increased resistance rice blast compared wild type erf mutant displayed strongest blast resistance similar triple mutant surprisingly found pi erf single mutant conferred enhanced resistance tested bacterial blight resistance mutant attribute upregulation sa japathway associated gene moreover phenotypic analysis single mutant paddy field revealed tradeoff resistance main agricultural trait together study provides rapid effective way generate rice variety resistance rice blast bacterial blight,8,"{'Disease': ['two major disease devastating impact yield rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['two major disease devastating impact yield rice ricegrowing country development resistant cultivar economic effective strategy control disease', 'rapid effective way']}",13
38729111,The phosphorylation landscape of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus.,"Many of the world's most devastating crop diseases are caused by fungal pathogens that elaborate specialized infection structures to invade plant tissue. Here, we present a quantitative mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis of infection-related development by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which threatens global food security. We mapped 8,005 phosphosites on 2,062 fungal proteins following germination on a hydrophobic surface, revealing major re-wiring of phosphorylation-based signaling cascades during appressorium development. Comparing phosphosite conservation across 41 fungal species reveals phosphorylation signatures specifically associated with biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infection. We then used parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to identify phosphoproteins regulated by the fungal Pmk1 MAPK that controls plant infection by M. oryzae. We define 32 substrates of Pmk1 and show that Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of regulator Vts1 is required for rice blast disease. Defining the phosphorylation landscape of infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic interventions for the control of plant diseases.",many world devastating crop disease caused fungal pathogen elaborate specialized infection structure invade plant tissue present quantitative massspectrometrybased phosphoproteomic analysis infectionrelated development rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae threatens global food security mapped phosphosites fungal protein following germination hydrophobic surface revealing major rewiring phosphorylationbased signaling cascade appressorium development comparing phosphosite conservation across fungal specie reveals phosphorylation signature specifically associated biotrophic hemibiotrophic fungal infection used parallel reaction monitoring prm identify phosphoprotein regulated fungal pmk mapk control plant infection oryzae define substrate pmk show pmkdependent phosphorylation regulator vt required rice blast disease defining phosphorylation landscape infection therefore identifies potential therapeutic intervention control plant disease,3,"{'Disease': ['many world devastating crop disease', 'development rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'rice blast disease defining phosphorylation landscape infection', 'potential therapeutic intervention control plant disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
38664971,"Recognition of the inducible, secretory small protein OsSSP1 by the membrane receptor OsSSR1 and the co-receptor OsBAK1 confers rice resistance to the blast fungus.","The plant apoplast, which serves as the frontline battleground for long-term host-pathogen interactions, harbors a wealth of disease resistance resources. However, the identification of the disease resistance proteins in the apoplast is relatively lacking. In this study, we identified and characterized the rice secretory protein OsSSP1 (Oryza sativa secretory small protein 1). OsSSP1 can be secreted into the plant apoplast, and either in vitro treatment of recombinant OsSSP1 or overexpression of OsSSP1 in rice could trigger plant immune response. The expression of OsSSP1 is suppressed significantly during Magnaporthe oryzae infection in the susceptible rice variety Taibei 309, and OsSSP1-overexpressing lines all show strong resistance to M. oryzae. Combining the knockout and overexpression results, we found that OsSSP1 positively regulates plant immunity in response to fungal infection. Moreover, the recognition and immune response triggered by OsSSP1 depend on an uncharacterized transmembrane OsSSR1 (secretory small protein receptor 1) and the key co-receptor OsBAK1, since most of the induced immune response and resistance are lost in the absence of OsSSR1 or OsBAK1. Intriguingly, the OsSSP1 protein is relatively stable and can still induce plant resistance after 1 week of storage in the open environment, and exogenous OsSSP1 treatment for a 2-week period did not affect rice yield. Collectively, our study reveals that OsSSP1 can be secreted into the apoplast and percepted by OsSSR1 and OsBAK1 during fungal infection, thereby triggering the immune response to enhance plant resistance to M. oryzae. These findings provide novel resources and potential strategies for crop breeding and disease control.",plant apoplast serf frontline battleground longterm hostpathogen interaction harbor wealth disease resistance resource however identification disease resistance protein apoplast relatively lacking study identified characterized rice secretory protein osssp oryza sativa secretory small protein osssp secreted plant apoplast either vitro treatment recombinant osssp overexpression osssp rice could trigger plant immune response expression osssp suppressed significantly magnaporthe oryzae infection susceptible rice variety taibei ossspoverexpressing line show strong resistance oryzae combining knockout overexpression result found osssp positively regulates plant immunity response fungal infection moreover recognition immune response triggered osssp depend uncharacterized transmembrane osssr secretory small protein receptor key coreceptor osbak since induced immune response resistance lost absence osssr osbak intriguingly osssp protein relatively stable still induce plant resistance week storage open environment exogenous osssp treatment week period affect rice yield collectively study reveals osssp secreted apoplast percepted osssr osbak fungal infection thereby triggering immune response enhance plant resistance oryzae finding provide novel resource potential strategy crop breeding disease control,1,"{'Disease': ['apoplast serf frontline battleground longterm hostpathogen interaction harbor wealth disease resistance resource', 'novel resource potential strategy crop breeding disease control'], 'Treatment': ['apoplast either vitro treatment recombinant osssp overexpression osssp rice', 'exogenous osssp treatment week period'], 'Symptom': []}",7
34739330,Mapping Blast Resistance Genes in Rice Varieties 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202'.,"Rice blast caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (syn. <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i>) is one of the most lethal diseases for sustainable rice production worldwide. Blast resistance mediated by major resistance genes is often broken down after a short period of deployment, while minor blast resistance genes, each providing a small effect on disease reactions, are more durable. In the present study, we first evaluated disease reactions of two rice breeding parents 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202' with 11 blast races, IA45, IB1, IB45, IB49, IB54, IC1, IC17, ID1, IE1, IG1, and IH1, commonly present in the United States, under greenhouse conditions using a category disease rating resembling infection types under field conditions. 'Minghui 63' exhibited differential resistance responses in comparison with those of 'M-202' to the tested blast races. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 275 lines from a cross between 'Minghui 63' and 'M-202' was also evaluated with the above-mentioned blast races. The population was genotyped with 156 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and insertion and deletion (Indel) markers. A linkage map with a genetic distance of 1,022.84 cM was constructed using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) software. A total of 10 resistance QTLs, eight from 'Minghui 63' and two from 'M-202', were identified. One major QTL, <i>qBLAST2</i> on chromosome 2, was identified by seven races/isolates. The remaining nine minor resistance QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

35581907,Surveillance of Rice Blast Resistance Effectiveness and Emerging Virulent Isolates in Taiwan.,"Rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a dangerous threat to rice production and food security worldwide. Breeding and proper deployment of resistant varieties are effective and environmentally friendly strategies to manage this notorious disease. However, a highly dynamic and quickly evolved rice blast pathogen population in the field has made disease control with resistance germplasms more challenging. Therefore, continued monitoring of pathogen dynamics and application of effective resistance varieties are critical tasks to prolong or sustain field resistance. Here, we report a team project that involved evaluation of rice blast resistance genes and surveillance of <i>M. oryzae</i> field populations in Taiwan. A set of International Rice Research Institute-bred blast-resistant lines (IRBLs) carrying single blast resistance genes was utilized to monitor the field effectiveness of rice blast resistance. Resistance genes such as <i>Ptr</i> (formerly <i>Pita2</i>) and <i>Pi9</i> exhibited the best and most durable resistance against the rice blast fungus population in Taiwan. Interestingly, line IRBLb-B harboring the <i>Pib</i> gene with good field protection has recently shown susceptible lesions in some locations. To dissect the genotypic features of virulent isolates against the <i>Pib</i> resistance gene, <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates were collected and analyzed. Screening of the <i>AvrPib</i> locus revealed that the majority of field isolates still maintained the wild-type <i>AvrPib</i> status but eight virulent genotypes were found. Pot3 insertion appeared to be a major way to disrupt the <i>AvrPib</i> avirulence function. Interestingly, a novel <i>AvrPib</i> double-allele genotype among virulent isolates was first identified. Pot2 repetitive element-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) fingerprinting analysis indicated that mutation events may occur independently among different lineages in different geographic locations of Taiwan.

39180629,Allelic variation in rice blast resistance: a pathway to sustainable disease management.,"Rice blast is a major problem in agriculture, affecting rice production and threatening food security worldwide. This disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, has led to a lot of research since the discovery of the first resistance gene, pib, in 1999. Researchers have now identified more than 50 resistance genes on eight of the twelve chromosomes in rice, each targeting different strains of the pathogen.These genes are spread out across seventeen different loci. These genes, which primarily code for nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins, play an important part in the defense of rice against the pathogen, either alone or in combination with other genes. An important characteristic of these genes is the allelic or paralogous interactions that exist within these loci. These relationships contribute to the gene's increased capacity for evolutionary adaptation. The ability of resistance proteins to recognize and react to novel effectors is improved by the frequent occurrence of variations within the domains that are responsible for recognizing pathogen effectors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the progress that has been made in identifying these essential genes and to investigate the possibility of utilizing the allelic variants obtained from these genes in future rice breeding efforts to increase resistance to rice blast.",rice blast major problem agriculture affecting rice production threatening food security worldwide disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae led lot research since discovery first resistance gene pib researcher identified resistance gene eight twelve chromosome rice targeting different strain pathogenthese gene spread across seventeen different locus gene primarily code nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat protein play important part defense rice pathogen either alone combination gene important characteristic gene allelic paralogous interaction exist within locus relationship contribute gene increased capacity evolutionary adaptation ability resistance protein recognize react novel effector improved frequent occurrence variation within domain responsible recognizing pathogen effector purpose review summarize progress made identifying essential gene investigate possibility utilizing allelic variant obtained gene future rice breeding effort increase resistance rice blast,2,"{'Disease': ['food security worldwide disease', 'fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['react novel effector', 'domain responsible recognizing pathogen effector purpose review']}",5

Average accuracies at jointing, booting and heading stages under the full-spectrum-based SVM model were 88.89%, 85.26%, and 87.32%, respectively, versus 80%, 83.16%, and 83.41% under the PNN model. Average accuracies at jointing, booting and heading stages under the STD-based SVM model were 97.78%, 92.63%, and 92.20%, respectively, versus 88.89%, 91.58%, and 92.20% under the PNN model.

34102436,Role of silicon in elevating resistance against sheath blight and blast diseases in rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani, are the two major diseases of rice that cause enormous losses in rice production worldwide. Identification and utilization of broad-spectrum resistance resources have been considered sustainable and effective strategies. However, the majority of the resistance genes and QTLs identified have often been found to be race-specific, and their resistance is frequently broken down due to continuous exposure to the pathogen. Therefore, integrated approaches to improve plant resistance against such devastating pathogen have great importance. Silicon (Si), a beneficial element for plant growth, has shown to provide a prophylactic effect against many pathogens. The application of Si helps the plants to combat the disease-causing pathogens, either through its deposition in different parts of the plant or through modulation/induction of specific defense genes by yet an unknown mechanism. Some reports have shown that Si imparts resistance to rice blast and sheath blight. The present review summarizes the mechanism of Si transport and deposition and its effect on rice growth and development. A special emphasis has been given to explore the existing evidence showing Si mediated blast and sheath blight resistance and the mechanism involved in resistance.

34453409,A double-edged sword: reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the rice blast fungus and host interaction.,"Magnaporthe oryzae is a hemibiotrophic fungus that also needs host nutrients for propagation during infection.

In M. oryzae, the accumulation of ROS is important for the formation and maturation of the infectious structure appressorium. On the other hand, upon M. oryzae infection, rice generates further ROS to restrict invasive hyphae (IH) spreading. Despite ROS receptors remaining to be identified, M. oryzae recruits several strategies to respond and suppress ROS accumulation through the secretion of various effector molecules.

The mechanisms underlying rice resistance to M. oryzae, such as transcriptional reprogramming and signalling networks, remain elusive. In this study, we carried out an in-depth comparative transcriptome study on the susceptible and resistant rice cultivars in response to M. oryzae. Our analysis highlighted that rapid, high-amplitude transcriptional reprogramming was important for rice defence against blast fungus. Ribosome- and protein translation-related genes were significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 12 hpi in both cultivars, indicating that the protein translation machinery is regulated in the activation of immunity in rice. Furthermore, we identified a core set of genes that are involved in the rice response to both biotic and abiotic stress. More importantly, among the core genes, we demonstrated that the metallothionein OsMT1a and OsMT1b genes positively regulated rice resistance while a peroxidase gene Perox4 negatively regulated rice resistance to M. oryzae.

17905473,"Susceptibility of rice to the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea.","The interaction between rice and the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea is the focus of extensive studies on rice disease resistance and fungal infection mechanisms. Here, we review the characteristics of susceptible rice blast infections in terms of physiology, cytology and both host and pathogen transcriptional responses. The success of the infection and the type of disease symptoms strongly depend on environmental and developmental cues. After its penetration into a host cell, the fungus differentiates invasive hyphae that fill up the plant cell lumen and are in direct contact with the membrane of the infected cell. The infected plant cell is alive, displaying considerable vesicle accumulation near the fungus, which is consistent with the establishment of a biotrophic phase at this stage of the infection. Colonization of host tissues by the fungus occurs through the perforation of cell walls from adjacent cells, likely using plasmodesmata as breaking points, or through hyphal growth in the apoplasm. After a few days of biotrophic growth within rice tissues, the fungus switches to a necrotrophic-like phase associated with the onset of sporulation, leading to visible lesions. Genome-wide transcriptomic studies have shown that classical plant defence responses are triggered during a susceptible infection, although the kinetics and amplitude of these responses are slower and lower than in resistant interactions. Infected rice cells are submitted to an intense transcriptional reprogramming, where responses to hormones such as auxins, abscissic acid and jasmonates are likely involved. Consistent with the extensive plant-fungal exchanges during the biotrophic phase, many rice genes expressed during infection encode plasma membrane proteins. At the onset of lesion formation (5 days after the start of infection), M. grisea is actively reprogramming its transcription towards active DNA, RNA and protein syntheses to sustain its rapid growth in infected tissues. A striking characteristic of M. grisea genes expressed at this stage of the infection is the over-representation of genes encoding secreted proteins, mainly of unknown function. However, some of these secreted proteins are enzymes involved in cell wall, protein and lipid degradation, suggesting that the fungus is starting to degrade host polymers and cell walls or is remodelling its own cell wall. The next challenge will be to decipher the role of these induced plant and fungal genes in the susceptible interaction.",interaction rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea focus extensive study rice disease resistance fungal infection mechanism review characteristic susceptible rice blast infection term physiology cytology host pathogen transcriptional response success infection type disease symptom strongly depend environmental developmental cue penetration host cell fungus differentiates invasive hypha fill plant cell lumen direct contact membrane infected cell infected plant cell alive displaying considerable vesicle accumulation near fungus consistent establishment biotrophic phase stage infection colonization host tissue fungus occurs perforation cell wall adjacent cell likely using plasmodesmata breaking point hyphal growth apoplasm day biotrophic growth within rice tissue fungus switch necrotrophiclike phase associated onset sporulation leading visible lesion genomewide transcriptomic study shown classical plant defence response triggered susceptible infection although kinetics amplitude response slower lower resistant interaction infected rice cell submitted intense transcriptional reprogramming response hormone auxin abscissic acid jasmonates likely involved consistent extensive plantfungal exchange biotrophic phase many rice gene expressed infection encode plasma membrane protein onset lesion formation day start infection grisea actively reprogramming transcription towards active dna rna protein synthesis sustain rapid growth infected tissue striking characteristic grisea gene expressed stage infection overrepresentation gene encoding secreted protein mainly unknown function however secreted protein enzyme involved cell wall protein lipid degradation suggesting fungus starting degrade host polymer cell wall remodelling cell wall next challenge decipher role induced plant fungal gene susceptible interaction,3,"{'Disease': ['interaction rice blast fungus magnaporthe', 'grisea focus extensive study rice disease resistance fungal infection mechanism', 'characteristic susceptible rice blast infection term physiology cytology host pathogen transcriptional response success infection type disease symptom', 'environmental developmental cue penetration host cell fungus differentiates invasive hypha fill plant cell lumen direct contact membrane infected cell infected plant cell', 'fungus', 'rice tissue fungus switch necrotrophiclike phase associated onset sporulation', 'fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['characteristic susceptible rice blast infection term physiology cytology host pathogen transcriptional response success infection type disease symptom']}",9

Multilines, which consist of a genetically uniform mixture of plants, have the potential to suppress disease while maintaining eating quality, yet practical methods that facilitate commercial use over large geographical areas are lacking. Here, we describe effective rice multiline management based on seed mixture composition changes informed by monitoring virulent blast races in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The most elite nonglutinous cultivar, Koshihikari, was converted into the multiline, Koshihikari BL (blast resistant lines) and planted on 94,000 ha in 2005. The most destructive rice disease, blast, was 79.4% and 81.8% less severe in leaves and panicles, respectively, during the 2005-2019 period compared to the year 2004. In addition, fungicidal application was reduced by two-thirds after the introduction of BL.

27070427,Coevolutionary Dynamics of Rice Blast Resistance Gene Pi-ta and Magnaporthe oryzae Avirulence Gene AVR-Pita 1.,"The Pi-ta gene in rice is effective in preventing infections by Magnaporthe oryzae strains that contain the corresponding avirulence gene, AVR-Pita1. Diverse haplotypes of AVR-Pita1 have been identified from isolates of M. oryzae from rice production areas in the United States and worldwide. DNA sequencing and mapping studies have revealed that AVR-Pita1 is highly unstable, while expression analysis and quantitative resistance loci mapping of the Pi-ta locus revealed complex evolutionary mechanisms of Pi-ta-mediated resistance. Among these studies, several Pi-ta transcripts were identified, most of which are probably derived from alternative splicing and exon skipping, which could produce functional resistance proteins that support a new concept of coevolution of Pi-ta and AVR-Pita1. User-friendly DNA markers for Pi-ta have been developed to support marker-assisted selection, and development of new rice varieties with the Pi-ta markers. Genome-wide association studies revealed a link between Pi-ta-mediated resistance and yield components suggesting that rice has evolved a complicated defense mechanism against the blast fungus. In this review, we detail the current understanding of Pi-ta allelic variation, its linkage with rice productivity, AVR-Pita allelic variation, and the coevolution of Pi-ta and AVR-Pita in Oryza species and M. oryzae populations, respectively.

37833893,Improvement of Rice Blast Resistance in TGMS Line HD9802S through Optimized Anther Culture and Molecular Marker-Assisted Selection.,"Rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is one of the most serious rice diseases worldwide. The early <i>indica</i> rice thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line HD9802S has the characteristics of stable fertility, reproducibility, a high outcrossing rate, excellent rice quality, and strong combining ability. However, this line exhibits poor blast resistance and is highly susceptible to leaf and neck blasts. In this study, backcross introduction, molecular marker-assisted selection, gene chipping, anther culture, and resistance identification in the field were used to introduce the broad-spectrum blast-resistance gene <i>R6</i> into HD9802S to improve its rice blast resistance. Six induction media were prepared by varying the content of each component in the culture medium.

The use of resistance (R) genes in rice improvement breeding programmes has been considered to be one of the best options for crop protection and blast management. Alternatively, quantitative resistance conferred by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is also a valuable resource for the improvement of rice disease resistance. In the past, intensive efforts have been made to identify major R-genes as well as QTLs for blast disease using molecular techniques. A review of bibliographic references shows over 100 blast resistance genes and a larger number of QTLs (∼500) that were mapped to the rice genome. Of the blast resistance genes, identified in different genotypes of rice, ∼22 have been cloned and characterized at the molecular level. In this review, we have summarized the reported rice blast resistance genes and QTLs for utilization in future molecular breeding programmes to introgress high-degree resistance or to pyramid R-genes in commercial cultivars that are susceptible to M. oryzae.

To understand the genetic variability of blast isolates collected between 2015 and 2017, the 27 monogenic rice lines that carry specific resistance genes were used to evaluate blast disease reactions. Based on criteria such as viability, virulence, and reactions to resistance genes, 20 blast isolates were selected as representative strains. To identify novel resistance genes, a quantitative trait locus analysis was carried out utilizing a mixture of the 20 representative rice blast isolates and a rice population derived from crossing the blast-resistant cultivar 'Cheongcheong' with the blast-susceptible cultivar 'Nagdong'. This analysis revealed a significant locus, RM1227-RM1261 on chromosome 12, that is associated with rice blast resistance.

38653755,Phytoalexin sakuranetin attenuates endocytosis and enhances resistance to rice blast.,"Phytoalexin sakuranetin functions in resistance against rice blast. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of sakuranetin remains elusive. Here, we report that rice lines expressing resistance (R) genes were found to contain high levels of sakuranetin, which correlates with attenuated endocytic trafficking of plasma membrane (PM) proteins. Exogenous and endogenous sakuranetin attenuates the endocytosis of various PM proteins and the fungal effector PWL2. Moreover, accumulation of the avirulence protein AvrCO39, resulting from uptake into rice cells by Magnaporthe oryzae, was reduced following treatment with sakuranetin. Pharmacological manipulation of clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) suggests that this pathway is targeted by sakuranetin. Indeed, attenuation of CME by sakuranetin is sufficient to convey resistance against rice blast.

33602120,Genome-wide association of rice response to blast fungus identifies loci for robust resistance under high nitrogen.,"Nitrogen fertilization is known to increase disease susceptibility, a phenomenon called Nitrogen-Induced Susceptibility (NIS). In rice, this phenomenon has been observed in infections with the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. A previous classical genetic study revealed a locus (NIS1) that enhances susceptibility to rice blast under high nitrogen fertilization. In order to further address the underlying genetics of plasticity in susceptibility to rice blast after fertilization, we analyzed NIS under greenhouse-controlled conditions in a panel of 139 temperate japonica rice strains. A genome-wide association analysis was conducted to identify loci potentially involved in NIS by comparing susceptibility loci identified under high and low nitrogen conditions, an approach allowing for the identification of loci validated across different nitrogen environments. We also used a novel NIS Index to identify loci potentially contributing to plasticity in susceptibility under different nitrogen fertilization regimes. A global NIS effect was observed in the population, with the density of lesions increasing by 8%, on average, under high nitrogen fertilization. Three new QTL, other than NIS1, were identified. A rare allele of the RRobN1 locus on chromosome 6 provides robust resistance in high and low nitrogen environments. A frequent allele of the NIS2 locus, on chromosome 5, exacerbates blast susceptibility under the high nitrogen condition. Finally, an allele of NIS3, on chromosome 10, buffers the increase of susceptibility arising from nitrogen fertilization but increases global levels of susceptibility. This allele is almost fixed in temperate japonicas, as a probable consequence of genetic hitchhiking with a locus involved in cold stress adaptation. Our results extend to an entire rice subspecies the initial finding that nitrogen increases rice blast susceptibility.

However, the cultivated area of Kongyu-131 has decreased each year due to extensive outbreaks of rice blast. To achieve the goals of improving blast resistance and preserving other desirable traits in Kongyu-131, a genome-updating method similar to repairing a bug in a computer program was adopted in this study. A new allele of the broad-spectrum blast resistance gene pi21 in the upland rice variety GKGH was mined by genetic analysis and introgressed into the genome of Kongyu-131 to upgrade its blast resistance. QTL analysis was performed with an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a cross between Kongyu-131 and GKGH, and a blast resistance QTL was detected near the pi21 locus. Parental Pi21 sequence alignment showed that the pi21 of the donor (GKGH) was a new allele. By 5 InDel or SNP markers designed based on the sequence within and around pi21, the introgressed chromosome segment was shortened to less than 634 kb to minimize linkage drag by screening recombinants in the target region. The RRPG was 99.92%, calculated according to 201 SNP markers evenly distributed on 12 chromosomes. Artificial inoculation at the seedling stage showed that the blast resistance of the new Kongyu-131 was improved significantly. Field experiments also indicated that the improved Kongyu-131 had enhanced field resistance to rice blast and grain-quality traits similar to those of the original Kongyu-131.

Here, we identified a resistance gene from the rice cultivar Fuhui 2663 which is resistant to the rice blast isolate KJ201. Through isolated population analyses and sequencing approaches, the candidate gene was traced to chromosome 12. With the use of a map-based cloning strategy, the resistance gene was ultimately mapped to an 80-kb resistance locus region containing the Pita gene. Candidate gene prediction and cDNA sequencing indicated that the target resistance gene in Fuhui 2663 was allelic to Pita, thus being referred to as Pita-Fuhui2663 hereafter. Further analysis showed that the Fuhui 2663 protein had one amino acid change: Ala (A) residue 918 in Pita-Fuhui2663 was replaced by Ser (S) in Pita-S, leading to a significant change in the 3D structure of the Pita-S protein.

Interaction analyses between avirulence effectors and their cognate resistance proteins have provided new insights into the molecular basis of plant-fungal interactions. In this review, we summarize the recent research on the characterization of those genes in both M. oryzae and rice that are important for the PAMP- and effector-triggered immunity recognition and signaling processes. We also discuss future directions for research that will further our understanding of this pathosystem.",rice blast caused fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae one destructive disease rice worldwide ricem oryzae pathosystem become model study plantfungal interaction scientific advancement economic importance recent study identified number new pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamps effector blast fungus trigger rice immune response upon perception interaction analysis avirulence effector cognate resistance protein provided new insight molecular basis plantfungal interaction review summarize recent research characterization gene oryzae rice important pamp effectortriggered immunity recognition signaling process also discus future direction research understanding pathosystem,1,"{'Disease': ['one destructive disease rice worldwide ricem oryzae pathosystem', 'effector blast fungus trigger rice immune response'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector blast fungus trigger rice immune response', 'perception interaction analysis avirulence effector cognate resistance protein']}",7
23990109,Cells in cells: morphogenetic and metabolic strategies conditioning rice infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a global food security threat due to its destruction of cultivated rice. Of the world's rice harvest, 10-30 % is lost each year to this pathogen, and changing climates are likely to favor its spread into new areas. Insights into how the fungus might be contained could come from the wealth of molecular and cellular studies that have been undertaken in order to shed light on the biological underpinnings of blast disease, aspects of which we review herein. Infection begins when a three-celled spore lands on the surface of a leaf, germinates, and develops the specialized infection structure called the appressorium. The mature appressorium develops a high internal turgor that acts on a thin penetration peg, forcing it through the rice cuticle and into the underlying epidermal cells. Primary then invasive hyphae (IH) elaborate from the peg and grow asymptomatically from one living rice cell to another for the first few days of infection before host cells begin to die and characteristic necrotic lesions form on the surface of the leaf, from which spores are produced to continue the life cycle. To gain new insights into the biology of rice blast disease, we argue that, conceptually, the infection process can be viewed as two discrete phases occurring in markedly different environments and requiring distinct biochemical pathways and morphogenetic regulation: outside the host cell, where the appressorium develops in a nutrient-free environment, and inside the host cell, where filamentous growth occurs in a glucose-rich, nitrogen-poor environment, at least from the perspective of the fungus. Here, we review the physiological and metabolic changes that occur in M. oryzae as it transitions from the surface to the interior of the host, thus enabling us to draw lessons about the strategies that allow M. oryzae cells to thrive in rice cells.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae global food security threat due destruction cultivated rice world rice harvest lost year pathogen changing climate likely favor spread new area insight fungus might contained could come wealth molecular cellular study undertaken order shed light biological underpinnings blast disease aspect review herein infection begin threecelled spore land surface leaf germinates develops specialized infection structure called appressorium mature appressorium develops high internal turgor act thin penetration peg forcing rice cuticle underlying epidermal cell primary invasive hypha ih elaborate peg grow asymptomatically one living rice cell another first day infection host cell begin die characteristic necrotic lesion form surface leaf spore produced continue life cycle gain new insight biology rice blast disease argue conceptually infection process viewed two discrete phase occurring markedly different environment requiring distinct biochemical pathway morphogenetic regulation outside host cell appressorium develops nutrientfree environment inside host cell filamentous growth occurs glucoserich nitrogenpoor environment least perspective fungus review physiological metabolic change occur oryzae transition surface interior host thus enabling u draw lesson strategy allow oryzae cell thrive rice cell,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae global food security threat', 'new area insight fungus', 'light biological underpinnings blast disease aspect review', 'new insight biology rice blast disease', 'least perspective fungus review physiological metabolic change'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
24240810,A review of microsatellite markers and their applications in rice breeding programs to improve blast disease resistance.,"Over the last few decades, the use of molecular markers has played an increasing role in rice breeding and genetics. Of the different types of molecular markers, microsatellites have been utilized most extensively, because they can be readily amplified by PCR and the large amount of allelic variation at each locus. Microsatellites are also known as simple sequence repeats (SSR), and they are typically composed of 1-6 nucleotide repeats. These markers are abundant, distributed throughout the genome and are highly polymorphic compared with other genetic markers, as well as being species-specific and co-dominant. For these reasons, they have become increasingly important genetic markers in rice breeding programs. The evolution of new biotypes of pests and diseases as well as the pressures of climate change pose serious challenges to rice breeders, who would like to increase rice production by introducing resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Recent advances in rice genomics have now made it possible to identify and map a number of genes through linkage to existing DNA markers. Among the more noteworthy examples of genes that have been tightly linked to molecular markers in rice are those that confer resistance or tolerance to blast. Therefore, in combination with conventional breeding approaches, marker-assisted selection (MAS) can be used to monitor the presence or lack of these genes in breeding populations. For example, marker-assisted backcross breeding has been used to integrate important genes with significant biological effects into a number of commonly grown rice varieties. The use of cost-effective, finely mapped microsatellite markers and MAS strategies should provide opportunities for breeders to develop high-yield, blast resistance rice cultivars. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the linkage of microsatellite markers to rice blast resistance genes, as well as to explore the use of MAS in rice breeding programs aimed at improving blast resistance in this species. We also discuss the various advantages, disadvantages and uses of microsatellite markers relative to other molecular marker types.",last decade use molecular marker played increasing role rice breeding genetics different type molecular marker microsatellites utilized extensively readily amplified pcr large amount allelic variation locus microsatellites also known simple sequence repeat ssr typically composed nucleotide repeat marker abundant distributed throughout genome highly polymorphic compared genetic marker well speciesspecific codominant reason become increasingly important genetic marker rice breeding program evolution new biotype pest disease well pressure climate change pose serious challenge rice breeder would like increase rice production introducing resistance multiple biotic abiotic stress recent advance rice genomics made possible identify map number gene linkage existing dna marker among noteworthy example gene tightly linked molecular marker rice confer resistance tolerance blast therefore combination conventional breeding approach markerassisted selection ma used monitor presence lack gene breeding population example markerassisted backcross breeding used integrate important gene significant biological effect number commonly grown rice variety use costeffective finely mapped microsatellite marker ma strategy provide opportunity breeder develop highyield blast resistance rice cultivar aim review summarize current knowledge concerning linkage microsatellite marker rice blast resistance gene well explore use ma rice breeding program aimed improving blast resistance specie also discus various advantage disadvantage us microsatellite marker relative molecular marker type,2,"{'Disease': ['increasingly important genetic marker rice breeding program evolution new biotype pest disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['integrate important gene significant biological effect number', 'costeffective finely mapped microsatellite marker ma strategy']}",13
34608507,Cloning and functional analysis of the novel rice blast resistance gene Pi65 in japonica rice.,"Pi65, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) domain cloned from Oryza sativa japonica, is a novel rice blast disease resistance gene. Rice blast seriously threatens rice production worldwide. Utilizing the rice blast resistance gene to breed rice blast-resistant varieties is one of the best ways to control rice blast disease. Using a map-based cloning strategy, we cloned a novel rice blast resistance gene, Pi65, from the resistant variety GangYu129 (abbreviated GY129, Oryza sativa japonica). Overexpression of Pi65 in the susceptible variety LiaoXing1 (abbreviated LX1, Oryza sativa japonica) enhanced rice blast resistance, while knockout of Pi65 in GY129 resulted in susceptibility to rice blast disease. Pi65 encodes two transmembrane domains, with 15 LRR domains and one serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain, conferring resistance to isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae (abbreviated M. oryzae) collected from Northeast China. There were sixteen amino acid differences between the Pi65 resistance and susceptible alleles. Compared with the Pi65-resistant allele, the susceptible allele exhibited one LRR domain deletion. Pi65 was constitutively expressed in whole plants, and it could be induced in the early stage of M. oryzae infection. Transcriptome analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with disease resistance were specifically upregulated in GY129 24 h post inoculation (HPI); in contrast, photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were particularly downregulated at 24 HPI, demonstrating that disease resistance-associated genes were activated in GY129 (carrying Pi65) after rice blast fungal infection and that cellular basal metabolism and energy metabolism were inhibited simultaneously.

In the present study, we identified that GF14e was highly expressed in panicles and was induced in panicles infected by blast pathogen. Overexpression of GF14e enhances resistance to panicle blast whereas silencing GF14e results in increased susceptibility to panicle blast, suggesting that GF14e plays a positive role in quantitative panicle blast resistance in rice. Our results also demonstrate that GF14e is regulated by WRKY71 and GF14e-mediated panicle blast resistance is related to activation of SA-dependent pathway and suppression of JA-dependent pathway.

33672641,Understanding Rice-<i>Magnaporthe Oryzae</i> Interaction in Resistant and Susceptible Cultivars of Rice under Panicle Blast Infection Using a Time-Course Transcriptome Analysis.,"Rice blast is a global threat to food security with up to 50% yield losses. Panicle blast is a more severe form of rice blast and the response of rice plant to leaf and panicle blast is distinct in different genotypes. To understand the specific response of rice in panicle blast, transcriptome analysis of blast resistant cultivar Tetep, and susceptible cultivar HP2216 was carried out using RNA-Seq approach after 48, 72 and 96 h of infection with <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> along with mock inoculation. Transcriptome data analysis of infected panicle tissues revealed that 3553 genes differentially expressed in HP2216 and 2491 genes in Tetep, which must be the responsible factor behind the differential disease response. The defense responsive genes are involved mainly in defense pathways namely, hormonal regulation, synthesis of reactive oxygen species, secondary metabolites and cell wall modification. The common differentially expressed genes in both the cultivars were defense responsive transcription factors, NBS-LRR genes, kinases, pathogenesis related genes and peroxidases. In Tetep, cell wall strengthening pathway represented by PMR5, dirigent, tubulin, cell wall proteins, chitinases, and proteases was found to be specifically enriched. Additionally, many novel genes having DOMON, VWF, and PCaP1 domains which are specific to cell membrane were highly expressed only in Tetep post infection, suggesting their role in panicle blast resistance. Thus, our study shows that panicle blast resistance is a complex phenomenon contributed by early defense response through ROS production and detoxification, MAPK and LRR signaling, accumulation of antimicrobial compounds and secondary metabolites, and cell wall strengthening to prevent the entry and spread of the fungi. The present investigation provided valuable candidate genes that can unravel the mechanisms of panicle blast resistance and help in the rice blast breeding program.",rice blast global threat food security yield loss panicle blast severe form rice blast response rice plant leaf panicle blast distinct different genotype understand specific response rice panicle blast transcriptome analysis blast resistant cultivar tetep susceptible cultivar hp carried using rnaseq approach h infection imagnaporthe oryzaei along mock inoculation transcriptome data analysis infected panicle tissue revealed gene differentially expressed hp gene tetep must responsible factor behind differential disease response defense responsive gene involved mainly defense pathway namely hormonal regulation synthesis reactive oxygen specie secondary metabolite cell wall modification common differentially expressed gene cultivar defense responsive transcription factor nbslrr gene kinase pathogenesis related gene peroxidase tetep cell wall strengthening pathway represented pmr dirigent tubulin cell wall protein chitinases protease found specifically enriched additionally many novel gene domon vwf pcap domain specific cell membrane highly expressed tetep post infection suggesting role panicle blast resistance thus study show panicle blast resistance complex phenomenon contributed early defense response ro production detoxification mapk lrr signaling accumulation antimicrobial compound secondary metabolite cell wall strengthening prevent entry spread fungi present investigation provided valuable candidate gene unravel mechanism panicle blast resistance help rice blast breeding program,4,"{'Disease': ['differential disease response defense responsive gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
35667655,The Vital Role of ShTHIC from the Endophyte OsiSh-2 in Thiamine Biosynthesis and Blast Resistance in the OsiSh-2-Rice Symbiont.,"Endophytes can benefit the growth and stress resistance of host plants by secreting bioactive components. Thiamine is an essential vitamin involved in many metabolic pathways and can only be synthesized by microbes and plants. In this study, we found that thiamine could inhibit the development of the phytopathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and decrease the rice blast index under field conditions. In the thiamine biosynthesis pathway, the key enzyme ShTHIC of an endophyte <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i> OsiSh-2 and OsTHIC of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) were highly homologous. Gene overexpression or knockout approaches revealed that both THIC contributed to thiamine synthesis and resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Furthermore, <i>S. hygroscopicus</i> OsiSh-2 colonization led to a decrease in the thiamine synthesis level of rice but still maintained thiamine homeostasis in rice. However, inoculation with the ShTHIC knockout strain Δ<i>THIC</i> reduced the thiamine content in rice, although the thiamine synthesis level of rice was increased. After infection with <i>M. oryzae</i>, blast resistance was dramatically improved in OsiSh-2-inoculated rice but decreased in Δ<i>THIC</i>-inoculated rice compared with non-inoculated rice. This result demonstrated that <i>ShTHIC</i> could regulate thiamine biosynthesis and consequently assist blast resistance in the OsiSh-2-rice symbiont.

35221310,Identification of broad-spectrum resistance QTLs against rice blast fungus and their application in different rice genetic backgrounds.,"Rice blast disease is found worldwide leading to economic losses. Use of resistance gene is effective to improve rice resistance variety. Therefore, to deploy genomic regions harbouring resistance genes, a population of 587 F<sub>2:6</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between Jao Hom Nin, a Thai black rice variety with broad-spectrum resistance to blast disease, and Kao Dawk Mali 105, a susceptible Thai jasmine variety. The RILs were challenged with 17 blast isolates collected from Thailand and Laos PDR. Quantitative trait locus analysis identified genomic regions associated with broad-spectrum quantitative resistance (qBSRLs) and racespecific quantitative resistance (qRSRLs). Two qBSRLs were detected on chromosomes 1 and 11, and two qRSRLs were detected on chromosomes 8 and 12. The two qBSRLs were introgressed into two new genetic backgrounds through marker-assisted selection (MAS). Twelve breeding lines were tested for their spectra of resistance against 35 blast isolates. The results indicated that both qBSRLs were effective in new genetic backgrounds. The flanking markers and qBSRLs identified in the large mapping population showed high selection accuracy and effectiveness, suggesting the routine deployment of MAS technique in rice breeding programmes.",rice blast disease found worldwide leading economic loss use resistance gene effective improve rice resistance variety therefore deploy genomic region harbouring resistance gene population fsubsub recombinant inbred line rils developed cross jao hom nin thai black rice variety broadspectrum resistance blast disease kao dawk mali susceptible thai jasmine variety rils challenged blast isolates collected thailand lao pdr quantitative trait locus analysis identified genomic region associated broadspectrum quantitative resistance qbsrls racespecific quantitative resistance qrsrls two qbsrls detected chromosome two qrsrls detected chromosome two qbsrls introgressed two new genetic background markerassisted selection ma twelve breeding line tested spectrum resistance blast isolates result indicated qbsrls effective new genetic background flanking marker qbsrls identified large mapping population showed high selection accuracy effectiveness suggesting routine deployment ma technique rice breeding programme,2,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'thai black rice variety broadspectrum resistance blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['high selection accuracy effectiveness']}",13
31640541,Predicting rice blast disease: machine learning versus process-based models.,"In this study, we compared four models for predicting rice blast disease, two operational process-based models (Yoshino and Water Accounting Rice Model (WARM)) and two approaches based on machine learning algorithms (M5Rules and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)), the former inducing a rule-based model and the latter building a neural network. In situ telemetry is important to obtain quality in-field data for predictive models and this was a key aspect of the RICE-GUARD project on which this study is based. According to the authors, this is the first time process-based and machine learning modelling approaches for supporting plant disease management are compared. Results clearly showed that the models succeeded in providing a warning of rice blast onset and presence, thus representing suitable solutions for preventive remedial actions targeting the mitigation of yield losses and the reduction of fungicide use. All methods gave significant ""signals"" during the ""early warning"" period, with a similar level of performance. M5Rules and WARM gave the maximum average normalized scores of 0.80 and 0.77, respectively, whereas Yoshino gave the best score for one site (Kalochori 2015). The best average values of r and r<sup>2</sup> and %MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for the machine learning models were 0.70, 0.50 and 0.75, respectively and for the process-based models the corresponding values were 0.59, 0.40 and 0.82. Thus it has been found that the ML models are competitive with the process-based models. This result has relevant implications for the operational use of the models, since most of the available studies are limited to the analysis of the relationship between the model outputs and the incidence of rice blast. Results also showed that machine learning methods approximated the performances of two process-based models used for years in operational contexts. Process-based and data-driven models can be used to provide early warnings to anticipate rice blast and detect its presence, thus supporting fungicide applications. Data-driven models derived from machine learning methods are a viable alternative to process-based approaches and - in cases when training datasets are available - offer a potentially greater adaptability to new contexts.",study compared four model predicting rice blast disease two operational processbased model yoshino water accounting rice model warm two approach based machine learning algorithm mrules recurrent neural network rnn former inducing rulebased model latter building neural network situ telemetry important obtain quality infield data predictive model key aspect riceguard project study based according author first time processbased machine learning modelling approach supporting plant disease management compared result clearly showed model succeeded providing warning rice blast onset presence thus representing suitable solution preventive remedial action targeting mitigation yield loss reduction fungicide use method gave significant signal early warning period similar level performance mrules warm gave maximum average normalized score respectively whereas yoshino gave best score one site kalochori best average value r rsupsup mae mean absolute error machine learning model respectively processbased model corresponding value thus found ml model competitive processbased model result relevant implication operational use model since available study limited analysis relationship model output incidence rice blast result also showed machine learning method approximated performance two processbased model used year operational context processbased datadriven model used provide early warning anticipate rice blast detect presence thus supporting fungicide application datadriven model derived machine learning method viable alternative processbased approach case training datasets available offer potentially greater adaptability new context,8,"{'Disease': ['modelling approach supporting plant disease management'], 'Treatment': ['modelling approach supporting plant disease management', 'fungicide use method', 'machine learning method', 'fungicide application datadriven model derived machine learning method viable alternative processbased approach case training datasets'], 'Symptom': []}",3

35343596,Identification of the rice genes and metabolites involved in dual resistance against brown planthopper and rice blast fungus.,"Brown planthopper (BPH) and blast disease jointly or individually cause big yield losses every year. To identify genes and metabolites with potential contributions to the dual resistance against both biotic-stress factors, we carried out a transcriptome and metabolome analysis for susceptible and resistant rice varieties after BPH and rice blast infestations. Coexpression network analysis identified a modular pattern that had the highest correlation coefficients (0.81) after the BPH and rice blast (-0.81) treatments. In total, 134 phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway-related genes were detected in this group. We found that the flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene (OsF3H) had opposite expression trends in response to BPH and rice blast infestations whereas the OsF3'H had similar expression patterns. Genetics analysis confirmed that the OsF3H gene knockdown lines demonstrated the opposite resistance phenotypes against BPH and rice blast, whereas the OsF3'H knockout lines enhanced rice resistance against both pests.

34058471,CBL-interacting protein kinase 31 regulates rice resistance to blast disease by modulating cellular potassium levels.,"Rice blast disease caused by infection with Magnaporthe oryzae, a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen, significantly reduces the yield production. However, the rice defense mechanism against blast disease remains elusive. To identify the genes involved in the regulation of rice defense to blast disease, dissociation (Ds) transposon tagging mutant lines were analyzed in terms of their response to M. oryzae isolate Guy11. Among them, CBL-interactingprotein kinase31 (CIPK31) mutants were more susceptible than wild-type plants to blast. The CIPK31 transcript was found to be insensitive to Guy11 infection, and the CIPK31-GFP was localized to the cytosol and nucleus. Overexpression of CIPK31 promoted rice defense to blast. Further analysis indicated that CIPK31 interacts with Calcineurin B-like 2 (CBL2) and CBL6 at the plasma membrane, and cbl2 mutants are more susceptible to blast compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that calcium signaling might partially through the CBL2-CIPK31 signaling regulate rice defense. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that AKT1-like (AKT1L), a potential potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel protein, interacted with CIPK31, and the K<sup>+</sup> level was significantly lower in the cipk31 mutants than in the wild-type control. In addition, exogenous potassium application increased rice resistance to blast, suggesting that CIPK31 might interact with AKT1L to increase K<sup>+</sup> uptake, thereby promoting resistance to blast.

38311793,Effects of Protection Time on Infection of Rice Panicle Blast.,"Panicle blast, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is a destructive disease of rice worldwide. Clarifying the susceptibility of rice panicles at different stages is of great significance for effective disease management. Field experiments were conducted in two paddy fields at Wuyuan County in 2016 and 2017 to determine the effects of head covering and its timing on the infection of rice panicle blast. Results revealed that panicle blast was reduced significantly by covering rice heads with sulfuric acid paper bags, regardless of the covering time, ranging from initial heading to 15 days afterward, suggesting that rice panicles could be infected by blast pathogen even 15 days after initial heading.

27116122,Enhanced Rice Blast Resistance by CRISPR/Cas9-Targeted Mutagenesis of the ERF Transcription Factor Gene OsERF922.,"Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases affecting rice worldwide. The adoption of host resistance has proven to be the most economical and effective approach to control rice blast. In recent years, sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for the improvement of crops via gene-specific genome editing, and CRISPR/Cas9 is thought to be the most effective SSN. Here, we report the improvement of rice blast resistance by engineering a CRISPR/Cas9 SSN (C-ERF922) targeting the OsERF922 gene in rice. Twenty-one C-ERF922-induced mutant plants (42.0%) were identified from 50 T0 transgenic plants. Sanger sequencing revealed that these plants harbored various insertion or deletion (InDel) mutations at the target site. We showed that all of the C-ERF922-induced allele mutations were transmitted to subsequent generations. Mutant plants harboring the desired gene modification but not containing the transferred DNA were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations. Six T2 homozygous mutant lines were further examined for a blast resistance phenotype and agronomic traits, such as plant height, flag leaf length and width, number of productive panicles, panicle length, number of grains per panicle, seed setting percentage and thousand seed weight. The results revealed that the number of blast lesions formed following pathogen infection was significantly decreased in all 6 mutant lines compared with wild-type plants at both the seedling and tillering stages. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between any of the 6 T2 mutant lines and the wild-type plants with regard to the agronomic traits tested. We also simultaneously targeted multiple sites within OsERF922 by using Cas9/Multi-target-sgRNAs (C-ERF922S1S2 and C-ERF922S1S2S3) to obtain plants harboring mutations at two or three sites.

The current blast management options such as blast-resistant varieties and spraying fungicides are neither durable nor commercially and environmentally compatible. In the present study, we investigated the antifungal and defense elicitor activity of potassium phosphite (Phi) against M. oryzae on elite rice cultivar BPT5204 (popularly known as Samba Mahsuri in India) and its transgenic rice variant (ptxD-OE) over-expressing a phosphite dehydrogenase enzyme. The Phi was evaluated both preventively and curatively on rice genotypes where the preventive spray of Phi outperformed the Phi curative application with significant reductions in both rice blast severity (35.67-60.49%) and incidence (22.27-53.25%). Moreover, the application of Phi increased the levels of photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll and Carotenoids) coupled with increased activity of defense enzymes (PAL, SOD, and APx). Besides, Phi application also induced the expression of defense-associated genes (OsCEBiP and OsPDF2.2) in the rice leaf. Furthermore, the Phi application reduced the reactive Malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation) to minimize the cellular damage incited by Magnaporthe in rice.

31852430,Osa-miR7695 enhances transcriptional priming in defense responses against the rice blast fungus.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in eukaryotes. In rice, MIR7695 expression is regulated by infection with the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae with subsequent down-regulation of an alternatively spliced transcript of natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 6 (OsNramp6). NRAMP6 functions as an iron transporter in rice. Rice plants grown under high iron supply showed blast resistance, which supports that iron is a factor in controlling blast resistance. During pathogen infection, iron accumulated in the vicinity of M. oryzae appressoria, the sites of pathogen entry, and in cells surrounding infected regions of the rice leaf. Activation-tagged MIR7695 rice plants (MIR7695-Ac) exhibited enhanced iron accumulation and resistance to M. oryzae infection. RNA-seq analysis revealed that blast resistance in MIR7695-Ac plants was associated with strong induction of defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related and diterpenoid biosynthetic genes. Levels of phytoalexins during pathogen infection were higher in MIR7695-Ac than wild-type plants. Early phytoalexin biosynthetic genes, OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, were also highly upregulated in wild-type rice plants grown under high iron supply. Our data support a positive role of miR7695 in regulating rice immunity that further underpin links between defense and iron signaling in rice.

37177781,The E3 ubiquitin ligase OsRGLG5 targeted by the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPi9 confers basal resistance against rice blast.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. During infection, M. oryzae secretes effectors to facilitate blast development. Among these effectors, the avirulence factor AvrPi9 is recognized by Pi9, a broad-spectrum blast resistance protein that triggers Pi9-mediated resistance in rice. However, little is known about the interaction between AvrPi9 and Pi9 and how AvrPi9 exerts virulence to promote infection. In this study, we found that ectopic expression of AvrPi9 in the Pi9-lacking cultivar TP309 suppressed basal resistance against M. oryzae. Furthermore, we identified an AvrPi9-interacting protein in rice, which we named OsRGLG5, encoding a functional RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. During infection, AvrPi9 was ubiquitinated and degraded by OsRGLG5. Meanwhile, AvrPi9 affected the stability of OsRGLG5. Infection assays revealed that OsRGLG5 is a positive regulator of basal resistance against M. oryzae, but it is not essential for Pi9-mediated blast resistance in rice. In conclusion, our results revealed that OsRGLG5 is targeted by the M. oryzae effector AvrPi9 and positively regulates basal resistance against rice blast.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae one devastating disease rice infection oryzae secretes effector facilitate blast development among effector avirulence factor avrpi recognized pi broadspectrum blast resistance protein trigger pimediated resistance rice however little known interaction avrpi pi avrpi exerts virulence promote infection study found ectopic expression avrpi pilacking cultivar tp suppressed basal resistance oryzae furthermore identified avrpiinteracting protein rice named osrglg encoding functional ringtype e ubiquitin ligase infection avrpi ubiquitinated degraded osrglg meanwhile avrpi affected stability osrglg infection assay revealed osrglg positive regulator basal resistance oryzae essential pimediated blast resistance rice conclusion result revealed osrglg targeted oryzae effector avrpi positively regulates basal resistance rice blast,10,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector avirulence factor avrpi', 'osrglg targeted oryzae effector avrpi']}",7

34962412,An Allelic Variant of the Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance Gene <i>Ptr</i> in Weedy Rice Is Associated with Resistance to the Most Virulent Blast Race IB-33.,"Rice resistance (<i>R</i>) genes have been effectively deployed to prevent blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, one of the most serious threats for stable rice production worldwide. Weedy rice competing with cultivated rice may carry novel or lost <i>R</i> genes.

In this study, we found a portion of the known resistance gene <i>Ptr</i> encoding a protein with four armadillo repeats and confers a broad spectrum of blast resistance. We then analyzed the sequences of the <i>Ptr</i> gene from weedy rice, <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i>, and identified a unique amino acid glutamine at protein position 874. Minor changes of protein conformation of the <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i> gene were predicted through structural analysis of <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i>, suggesting that the product of <i>Ptr<sup>BHA</sup></i> is involved in disease resistance.

35205268,Selection of Candidate Genes Conferring Blast Resistance and Heat Tolerance in Rice through Integration of Meta-QTLs and RNA-Seq.,"Due to global warming, high temperature is a significant environmental stress for rice production. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.), one of the most crucial cereal crops, is also seriously devastated by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. Therefore, it is essential to breed new rice cultivars with blast and heat tolerance. Although progress had been made in QTL mapping and RNA-seq analysis in rice in response to blast and heat stresses, there are few reports on simultaneously mining blast-resistant and heat-tolerant genes. In this study, we separately conducted meta-analysis of 839 blast-resistant and 308 heat-tolerant QTLs in rice. Consequently, 7054 genes were identified in 67 blast-resistant meta-QTLs with an average interval of 1.00 Mb.

34181437,Marker-Assisted Development and Evaluation of Monogenic Lines of Rice cv. Kaohsiung 145 Carrying Blast Resistance Genes.,"Rice blast is a serious threat to global rice production. Large-scale and long-term cultivation of rice varieties with a single blast resistance gene usually leads to breakdown of resistance. To effectively control rice blast in Taiwan, marker-assisted backcrossing was conducted to develop monogenic lines carrying different blast resistance genes in the genetic background of an elite japonica rice cultivar, Kaohsiung 145 (KH145). Eleven International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)-bred blast-resistant lines (IRBLs) showing broad-spectrum resistance to local <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> isolates were used as resistance donors. Sequencing analysis revealed that the recurrent parent, KH145, does not carry known resistance alleles at the target <i>Pi2</i>/<i>9</i>, <i>Pik</i>, <i>Pita</i>, and <i>Ptr</i> loci. For each IRBL × KH145 cross, we screened 21 to 370 (average of 108) plants per generation from the BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> to BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>1</sub>/BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>1</sub> generation. A total of 1,499 BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>/BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>2</sub> lines carrying homozygous resistance alleles were selected and self-crossed for four to six successive generations. The derived lines were also evaluated for background genotype using genotyping by sequencing, for blast resistance under artificial inoculation and natural infection conditions, and for agronomic performance in multiple field trials. In Chiayi and Taitung blast nurseries in 2018 to 2020, <i>Pi2</i>, <i>Pi9</i>, and <i>Ptr</i> conferred high resistance, <i>Pi20</i> and <i>Pik-h</i> moderate resistance, and <i>Pi1</i>, <i>Pi7</i>, <i>Pik-p</i>, and <i>Pik</i> susceptibility to leaf blast; only <i>Pi2</i>, <i>Pi9</i>, and <i>Ptr</i> conferred effective resistance against panicle blast.

We previously developed an elite hybrid rice restorer line with high resistance to rice blast, Yahui2115 (YH2115). To identify the blast resistance genes in YH2115, we first performed expression profiling on previously reported blast resistance genes and disease assay on monogenic lines, and we found that Pi2, Pi9, and Pikm were the most likely resistance candidates in YH2115. Furthermore, RNA interference and linkage analysis demonstrated that silencing of Pi2 reduced the blast resistance of YH2115 and a Pi2 linkage marker was closely associated with blast resistance in an F2 population generated from YH2115. These data suggest that the broad-spectrum blast resistance gene Pi2 contributes greatly to the blast resistance of YH2115.

37966176,Peroxisome dynamics determines host-derived ROS accumulation and infectious growth of the rice blast fungus.,"The interplay between plant and pathogen is a dynamic process, with the host's innate defense mechanisms serving a crucial role in preventing infection. In response to many plant pathogen infections, host cells generate the key regulatory molecule, reactive oxygen species (ROS), to limit the spread of the invading organism. In this study, we reveal the effects of fungal peroxisome dynamics on host ROS homeostasis, during the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> infection. The elongation of the peroxisome appears contingent upon ROS and links to the accumulation of ROS within the host and the infectious growth of the pathogen. Importantly, we identify a peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, MoKat2, responsible for the elongation of the peroxisome during the infection. In response to host-derived ROS, the homodimer of MoKat2 undergoes dissociation to bind peroxisome membranes for peroxisome elongation. This process, in turn, inhibits the accumulation of host ROS, which is necessary for successful infection. Overall, our study is the first to highlight the intricate relationship between fungal organelle dynamics and ROS-mediated host immunity, extending the fundamental knowledge of pathogen-host interaction.",interplay plant pathogen dynamic process host innate defense mechanism serving crucial role preventing infection response many plant pathogen infection host cell generate key regulatory molecule reactive oxygen specie ro limit spread invading organism study reveal effect fungal peroxisome dynamic host ro homeostasis rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei infection elongation peroxisome appears contingent upon ro link accumulation ro within host infectious growth pathogen importantly identify peroxisomal ketoacylcoa thiolase mokat responsible elongation peroxisome infection response hostderived ro homodimer mokat undergoes dissociation bind peroxisome membrane peroxisome elongation process turn inhibits accumulation host ro necessary successful infection overall study first highlight intricate relationship fungal organelle dynamic rosmediated host immunity extending fundamental knowledge pathogenhost interaction,3,"{'Disease': ['homeostasis rice blast fungus imagnaporthe'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['reveal effect fungal peroxisome dynamic host']}",8
34615543,"Genomic insight into balancing high yield, good quality, and blast resistance of japonica rice.","Balancing the yield, quality and resistance to disease is a daunting challenge in crop breeding due to the negative relationship among these traits. Large-scale genomic landscape analysis of germplasm resources is considered to be an efficient approach to dissect the genetic basis of the complex traits. Central China is one of the main regions where the japonica rice is produced. However, dozens of high-yield rice varieties in this region still exist with low quality or susceptibility to blast disease, severely limiting their application in rice production. Here, we re-sequence 200 japonica rice varieties grown in central China over the past 30 years and analyze the genetic structure of these cultivars using 2.4 million polymorphic SNP markers. Genome-wide association mapping and selection scans indicate that strong selection for high-yield and taste quality associated with low-amylose content may have led to the loss of resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.

Based on this information, we successfully introduce excellent taste quality and blast-resistant alleles into the background of two high-yield cultivars and develop two elite lines, XY99 and JXY1, with excellent taste, high yield, and broad-spectrum of blast resistance.

In the present study, a subset of a United States Department of Agriculture rice core collection consisting of 151 accessions was selected using a major blast resistance (R) gene, Pi-ta, marker and was genotyped with 156 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Disease reactions to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, were evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions, and heading date, plant height, paddy and brown seed weight in two field environments were analyzed, using an association mapping approach. A total of 21 SSR markers distributed among rice chromosomes 2 to 12 were associated with blast resistance, and 16 SSR markers were associated with seed weight, heading date, and plant height. Most noticeably, shorter plants were significantly correlated with resistance to blast, rice genomes with Pi-ta were associated with lighter seed weights, and the susceptible alleles of RM171 and RM6544 were associated with heavier seed weight.

34912119,NLRs guard metabolism to coordinate pattern- and effector-triggered immunity.,"Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants enable them to respond to pathogens by activating the production of defence metabolites that orchestrate immune responses<sup>1-4</sup>. How the production of defence metabolites is promoted by immune receptors and coordinated with broad-spectrum resistance remains elusive. Here we identify the deubiquitinase PICI1 as an immunity hub for PTI and ETI in rice (Oryza sativa). PICI1 deubiquitinates and stabilizes methionine synthetases to activate methionine-mediated immunity principally through biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene. PICI1 is targeted for degradation by blast fungal effectors, including AvrPi9, to dampen PTI. Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptors (NLRs) in the plant immune system, such as PigmR, protect PICI1 from effector-mediated degradation to reboot the methionine-ethylene cascade. Natural variation in the PICI1 gene contributes to divergence in basal blast resistance between the rice subspecies indica and japonica. Thus, NLRs govern an arms race with effectors, using a competitive mode that hinges on a critical defence metabolic pathway to synchronize PTI with ETI and ensure broad-spectrum resistance.",patterntriggered immunity pti effectortriggered immunity eti plant enable respond pathogen activating production defence metabolite orchestrate immune responsessupsup production defence metabolite promoted immune receptor coordinated broadspectrum resistance remains elusive identify deubiquitinase pici immunity hub pti eti rice oryza sativa pici deubiquitinates stabilizes methionine synthetases activate methioninemediated immunity principally biosynthesis phytohormone ethylene pici targeted degradation blast fungal effector including avrpi dampen pti nucleotidebinding domain leucinerichrepeatcontaining receptor nlrs plant immune system pigmr protect pici effectormediated degradation reboot methionineethylene cascade natural variation pici gene contributes divergence basal blast resistance rice subspecies indica japonica thus nlrs govern arm race effector using competitive mode hinge critical defence metabolic pathway synchronize pti eti ensure broadspectrum resistance,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['phytohormone ethylene pici targeted degradation blast fungal effector', 'receptor nlrs plant immune system pigmr protect pici effectormediated degradation', 'thus nlrs govern arm race effector']}",7
25403621,Genome-wide association study of blast resistance in indica rice.,"Rice blast disease is one of the most serious and recurrent problems in rice-growing regions worldwide. Most resistance genes were identified by linkage mapping using genetic populations. We extensively examined 16 rice blast strains and a further genome-wide association study based on genotyping 0.8 million single nucleotide polymorphism variants across 366 diverse indica accessions. Totally, thirty associated loci were identified. The strongest signal (Chr11_6526998, P =1.17 × 10-17) was located within the gene Os11g0225100, one of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene. Another association signal (Chr11_30606558) was detected around the QTL Pif. Our study identified the gene Os11g0704100, a disease resistance protein containing nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat domain, as the main candidate gene of Pif. In order to explore the potential mechanism underlying the blast resistance, we further examined a locus in chromosome 12, which was associated with CH149 (P =7.53 × 10-15). The genes, Os12g0424700 and Os12g0427000, both described as kinase-like domain containing protein, were presumed to be required for the full function of this locus. Furthermore, we found some association on chromosome 3, in which it has not been reported any loci associated with rice blast resistance. In addition, we identified novel functional candidate genes, which might participate in the resistance regulation. This work provides the basis of further study of the potential function of these candidate genes. A subset of true associations would be weakly associated with outcome in any given GWAS; therefore, large-scale replication is necessary to confirm our results.

34728643,Accumulating candidate genes for broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast in a drought-tolerant rice cultivar.,"Biotic stresses, including diseases, severely affect rice production, compromising producers' ability to meet increasing global consumption. Understanding quantitative responses for resistance to diverse pathogens can guide development of reliable molecular markers, which, combined with advanced backcross populations, can accelerate the production of more resistant varieties. A candidate gene (CG) approach was used to accumulate different disease QTL from Moroberekan, a blast-resistant rice variety, into Vandana, a drought-tolerant variety. The advanced backcross progeny were evaluated for resistance to blast and tolerance to drought at five sites in India and the Philippines. Gene-based markers were designed to determine introgression of Moroberekan alleles for 11 CGs into the progeny. Six CGs, coding for chitinase, HSP90, oxalate oxidase, germin-like proteins, peroxidase and thaumatin-like protein, and 21 SSR markers were significantly associated with resistance to blast across screening sites. Multiple lines with different combinations, classes and numbers of CGs were associated with significant levels of race non-specific resistance to rice blast and sheath blight. Overall, the level of resistance effective in multiple locations was proportional to the number of CG alleles accumulated in advanced breeding lines.

39725611,Circadian Regulation of the Rice Immune Response during Rice Blast Infection via Metabolic and Calcium Signaling.,"The circadian clock is crucial in plant immunity and metabolism, yet the coordinating mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, transcriptome analysis of <i>M. oryzae</i>-infected rice leaves and rhythmic analysis showed reduced amplitudes of circadian and phytochrome genes, impacting immune response, metabolic pathways, and calcium signaling. The amplitudes of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-related genes declined, while the rhythmicity of effector-triggered immunity (ETI)-related genes disappeared. Moreover, alterations in the phases of metabolic pathways were observed, potentially involved in immune response regulation like phytohormone biosynthesis. Calcium signaling exhibited a circadian pattern similar to that of the whole-transcriptome analysis. The administration of CaCl<sub>2</sub> alleviated, whereas the calcium ion chelator EGTA aggravated, the phenotypes of rice blasts, suggesting their role in regulating the circadian clock-mediated immune response in rice.

27907101,Economic and Environmental Impact of Rice Blast Pathogen (Magnaporthe oryzae) Alleviation in the United States.,"Rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) is a key concern in combating global food insecurity given the disease is responsible for approximately 30% of rice production losses globally-the equivalent of feeding 60 million people. These losses increase the global rice price and reduce consumer welfare and food security. Rice is the staple crop for more than half the world's population so any reduction in rice blast would have substantial beneficial effects on consumer livelihoods. In 2012, researchers in the US began analyzing the feasibility of creating blast-resistant rice through cisgenic breeding. Correspondingly, our study evaluates the changes in producer, consumer, and environmental welfare, if all the rice produced in the Mid-South of the US were blast resistant through a process like cisgenics, using both international trade and environmental assessment modeling. Our results show that US rice producers would gain 69.34 million dollars annually and increase the rice supply to feed an additional one million consumers globally by eliminating blast from production in the Mid-South. These results suggest that blast alleviation could be even more significant in increasing global food security given that the US is a small rice producer by global standards and likely experiences lower losses from blast than other rice-producing countries because of its ongoing investment in production technology and management. Furthermore, results from our detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) show that producing blast-resistant rice has lower environmental (fossil fuel depletion, ecotoxicity, carcinogenics, eutrophication, acidification, global warming potential, and ozone depletion) impacts per unit of rice than non-blast resistant rice production. Our findings suggest that any reduction in blast via breeding will have significantly positive impacts on reducing global food insecurity through increased supply, as well as decreased price and environmental impacts in production.",rice blast magnaporthe oryzae key concern combating global food insecurity given disease responsible approximately rice production loss globallythe equivalent feeding million people loss increase global rice price reduce consumer welfare food security rice staple crop half world population reduction rice blast would substantial beneficial effect consumer livelihood researcher u began analyzing feasibility creating blastresistant rice cisgenic breeding correspondingly study evaluates change producer consumer environmental welfare rice produced midsouth u blast resistant process like cisgenics using international trade environmental assessment modeling result show u rice producer would gain million dollar annually increase rice supply feed additional one million consumer globally eliminating blast production midsouth result suggest blast alleviation could even significant increasing global food security given u small rice producer global standard likely experience lower loss blast riceproducing country ongoing investment production technology management furthermore result detailed life cycle assessment lca show producing blastresistant rice lower environmental fossil fuel depletion ecotoxicity carcinogenics eutrophication acidification global warming potential ozone depletion impact per unit rice nonblast resistant rice production finding suggest reduction blast via breeding significantly positive impact reducing global food insecurity increased supply well decreased price environmental impact production,8,"{'Disease': ['disease'], 'Treatment': ['small rice producer global standard likely experience lower loss blast riceproducing country ongoing investment production technology management'], 'Symptom': ['beneficial effect consumer livelihood researcher u', 'blastresistant rice lower environmental fossil fuel depletion ecotoxicity carcinogenics eutrophication acidification global warming potential ozone depletion impact', 'significantly positive impact', 'increased supply well decreased price environmental impact production']}",10
38294722,Unveiling the mechanism of broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice: The collaborative role of transcription factor OsGRAS30 and histone deacetylase OsHDAC1.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, significantly impacts grain yield, necessitating the identification of broad-spectrum resistance genes and their functional mechanisms for disease-resistant crop breeding. Here, we report that rice with knockdown OsHDAC1 gene expression displays enhanced broad-spectrum blast resistance without effects on plant height and tiller numbers compared to wild-type rice, while rice overexpressing OsHDAC1 is more susceptible to M. oryzae. We identify a novel blast resistance transcription factor, OsGRAS30, which genetically acts upstream of OsHDAC1 and interacts with OsHDAC1 to suppress its enzymatic activity. This inhibition increases the histone H3K27ac level, thereby boosting broad-spectrum blast resistance. Integrating genome-wide mapping of OsHDAC1 and H3K27ac targets with RNA sequencing analysis unveils how OsHDAC1 mediates the expression of OsSSI2, OsF3H, OsRLR1 and OsRGA5 to regulate blast resistance. Our findings reveal that the OsGRAS30-OsHDAC1 module is critical to rice blast control.

38770581,OsMPK12 positively regulates rice blast resistance via OsEDC4-mediated transcriptional regulation of immune-related genes.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades are functionally important signalling modules in eukaryotes. Transcriptome reprogramming of immune-related genes is a key process in plant immunity. Emerging evidence shows that plant MAPK cascade is associated with processing (P)-body components and contributes to transcriptome reprogramming of immune-related genes. However, it remains largely unknown how this process is regulated. Here, we show that OsMPK12, which is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection, positively regulates rice blast resistance. Further analysis revealed that OsMPK12 directly interacts with enhancer of mRNA decapping protein 4 (OsEDC4), a P-body-located protein, and recruits OsEDC4 to where OsMPK12 is enriched. Importantly, OsEDC4 directly interacts with two decapping complex members OsDCP1 and OsDCP2, indicating that OsEDC4 is a subunit of the mRNA decapping complex. Additionally, we found that OsEDC4 positively regulates rice blast resistance by regulating expression of immune-related genes and maintaining proper mRNA levels of some negatively-regulated genes. And OsMPK12 and OsEDC4 are also involved in rice growth and development regulation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that OsMPK12 positively regulates rice blast resistance via OsEDC4-mediated mRNA decay of immune-related genes, providing new insight into not only the new role of the MAPK signalling cascade, but also posttranscriptional regulation of immune-related genes.",mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk signalling cascade functionally important signalling module eukaryote transcriptome reprogramming immunerelated gene key process plant immunity emerging evidence show plant mapk cascade associated processing pbody component contributes transcriptome reprogramming immunerelated gene however remains largely unknown process regulated show osmpk induced magnaporthe oryzae infection positively regulates rice blast resistance analysis revealed osmpk directly interacts enhancer mrna decapping protein osedc pbodylocated protein recruit osedc osmpk enriched importantly osedc directly interacts two decapping complex member osdcp osdcp indicating osedc subunit mrna decapping complex additionally found osedc positively regulates rice blast resistance regulating expression immunerelated gene maintaining proper mrna level negativelyregulated gene osmpk osedc also involved rice growth development regulation taken together data demonstrate osmpk positively regulates rice blast resistance via osedcmediated mrna decay immunerelated gene providing new insight new role mapk signalling cascade also posttranscriptional regulation immunerelated gene,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
36656825,Disentangling the complex gene interaction networks between rice and the blast fungus identifies a new pathogen effector.,"Studies focused solely on single organisms can fail to identify the networks underlying host-pathogen gene-for-gene interactions. Here, we integrate genetic analyses of rice (Oryza sativa, host) and rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae, pathogen) and uncover a new pathogen recognition specificity of the rice nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) immune receptor Pik, which mediates resistance to M. oryzae expressing the avirulence effector gene AVR-Pik.

AVR-Mgk1 has no sequence similarity to known AVR-Pik effectors and is prone to deletion from the mini-chromosome mediated by repeated Inago2 retrotransposon sequences. AVR-Mgk1 is detected by Piks-1 and by other Pik-1 alleles known to recognize AVR-Pik effectors; recognition is mediated by AVR-Mgk1 binding to the integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain of Piks-1 and other Pik-1 alleles.

Dimetindene maleate is used in medication against allergic reactions in humans. Dimetindene maleate used to induce systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) in order to protect rice plants from blast disease. Dimetindene maleate was not effective against fungus linear growth in vitro. In glasshouse conditions, dimetindene maleate significantly improved resistance at 25, 50, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg L<sup>-1</sup> concentrations. Leaf blast severity reached 14.18% on plants treated with the most effective concentration of 125 mg L<sup>-1</sup> compared with control plants.

31549233,Effect of temperature on Pi54-mediated leaf blast resistance in rice.,"Assessment of temperature effect on plant resistance against diseases has become essential under climate change scenario as temperature rise is anticipated to modify host resistance. To determine temperature influence on resistance gene, a pair of near-isogenic rice lines differing for the Pi54 resistance gene was assessed against leaf blast. Blast resistance was determined as the extent of infection efficiency (IE) and sporulation (SP) at suboptimal (22 °C and 32 °C) and optimal temperature (27 °C) of pathogen aggressiveness. Relative resistance for IE and SP was higher at suboptimal temperature as compared to that of optimal temperature. Maximum level of resistance was at 22 °C where higher levels of expression of Pi54 and defence-regulatory transcription factor WRKY45 were also noted. At 32 °C, although some level of resistance noted, but level of Pi54 and WRKY45 expression was too low, suggesting that resistance recorded at higher temperature was due to reduced pathogen aggressiveness. At the optimal temperature for pathogen aggressiveness, comparatively lower levels of Pi54 and WRKY45 expression suggest possible temperature-induced interruption of the defence processes. The variation in resistance patterns modulated by temperature is appeared to be due to pathogen's sensitivity to temperature that leads to varying levels of Pi54 gene activation. Quick and violent activity of the pathogen at optimal temperature came into sight for the interruption of defence process activated by Pi54 gene. Evaluation of blast resistance genes under variable temperature conditions together with weather data could be applied in screening rice genotypes for selection of resistance having resilience to temperature rise.",assessment temperature effect plant resistance disease become essential climate change scenario temperature rise anticipated modify host resistance determine temperature influence resistance gene pair nearisogenic rice line differing pi resistance gene assessed leaf blast blast resistance determined extent infection efficiency ie sporulation sp suboptimal °c °c optimal temperature °c pathogen aggressiveness relative resistance ie sp higher suboptimal temperature compared optimal temperature maximum level resistance °c higher level expression pi defenceregulatory transcription factor wrky also noted °c although level resistance noted level pi wrky expression low suggesting resistance recorded higher temperature due reduced pathogen aggressiveness optimal temperature pathogen aggressiveness comparatively lower level pi wrky expression suggest possible temperatureinduced interruption defence process variation resistance pattern modulated temperature appeared due pathogen sensitivity temperature lead varying level pi gene activation quick violent activity pathogen optimal temperature came sight interruption defence process activated pi gene evaluation blast resistance gene variable temperature condition together weather data could applied screening rice genotype selection resistance resilience temperature rise,10,"{'Disease': ['assessment temperature effect plant resistance disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['assessment temperature effect plant resistance disease']}",7

39404763,Phytochrome B promotes blast disease resistance and enhances yield in rice.,"Phytochromes are red/far-red light receptors that regulate various aspects of plant growth, development, and stress responses. The precise mechanism by which phytochrome B (PhyB)-mediated light signaling influences plant defense and development remains unclear. In this study, we showed that PhyB enhances rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease resistance, tillering, and grain size compared to wild-type plants. Notably, PhyB interacted with and degraded grassy tiller 1 (GT1), a negative regulator of tiller development. Knockdown of GT1 in a phyB background partially rescued the diminished tillering of phyB. However, GT1 negatively regulates rice resistance to blast, suggesting that PhyB degradation of GT1 promotes tillering but not blast resistance. Previously, PhyB was found to interact with and degrade phytochrome-interacting factor 15 (PIL15), a key regulator of seed development that reduces rice resistance to blast and seed size. pil15 mutation in phyB mutants rescued phyB seed size and blast resistance, suggesting that PhyB might interact with and degrade PIL15 to negatively regulate blast resistance and seed size. PIL15 directly activated sugar will be eventually exported transporter 2a (SWEET2a). sweet2a mutants were less susceptible to blast disease compared to wild type. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PhyB promotes rice yield and blast resistance by inhibiting the transcription factors GT1 and PIL15 and downstream signaling.",phytochromes redfarred light receptor regulate various aspect plant growth development stress response precise mechanism phytochrome b phybmediated light signaling influence plant defense development remains unclear study showed phyb enhances rice oryza sativa blast disease resistance tillering grain size compared wildtype plant notably phyb interacted degraded grassy tiller gt negative regulator tiller development knockdown gt phyb background partially rescued diminished tillering phyb however gt negatively regulates rice resistance blast suggesting phyb degradation gt promotes tillering blast resistance previously phyb found interact degrade phytochromeinteracting factor pil key regulator seed development reduces rice resistance blast seed size pil mutation phyb mutant rescued phyb seed size blast resistance suggesting phyb might interact degrade pil negatively regulate blast resistance seed size pil directly activated sugar eventually exported transporter sweeta sweeta mutant less susceptible blast disease compared wild type collectively data demonstrate phyb promotes rice yield blast resistance inhibiting transcription factor gt pil downstream signaling,8,"{'Disease': ['rice oryza sativa blast disease resistance tillering grain size', 'eventually exported transporter sweeta sweeta mutant less susceptible blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
34482912,Antifungal activity of glyphosate against fungal blast disease on glyphosate-tolerant OsmEPSPS transgenic rice.,"Weeds, pests, and pathogens are among the pre-harvest constraints in rice farming across rice-growing countries. For weed management, manual weeding and herbicides are widely practiced. Among the herbicides, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is a broad-spectrum systemic chemical extensively used in agriculture. Being a competitive structural analog to phosphoenolpyruvate, it selectively inhibits the conserved 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme required for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and essential metabolites in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In the present study, we investigated the antifungal and defense elicitor activity of glyphosate against Magnaporthe oryzae on transgenic-rice overexpressing a glyphosate-resistance OsEPSPS gene (T173I + P177S; TIPS OsmEPSPS) for blast disease management. The glyphosate foliar spray on OsmEPSPS transgenic rice lines showed both prophylactic and curative suppression of blast disease comparable to a blasticide, tricyclazole. The glyphosate displayed direct antifungal activity on Magnaporthe oryzae as well as enhanced the levels of antioxidant enzymes and photosynthetic pigments in rice. However, the genes associated with phytohormones-mediated defense (OsPAD4, OsNPR1.3, and OsFMO) and innate immunity pathway (OsCEBiP and OsCERK1) were found repressed upon glyphosate spray. Altogether, the current study is the first report highlighting the overexpression of a crop-specific TIPS mutation in conjugation with glyphosate application showing potential for blast disease management in rice cultivation.",weed pest pathogen among preharvest constraint rice farming across ricegrowing country weed management manual weeding herbicide widely practiced among herbicide glyphosate nphosphonomethyl glycine broadspectrum systemic chemical extensively used agriculture competitive structural analog phosphoenolpyruvate selectively inhibits conserved enolpyruvylshikimatephosphate synthase epsps enzyme required biosynthesis aromatic amino acid essential metabolite eukaryote prokaryote present study investigated antifungal defense elicitor activity glyphosate magnaporthe oryzae transgenicrice overexpressing glyphosateresistance osepsps gene ti p tip osmepsps blast disease management glyphosate foliar spray osmepsps transgenic rice line showed prophylactic curative suppression blast disease comparable blasticide tricyclazole glyphosate displayed direct antifungal activity magnaporthe oryzae well enhanced level antioxidant enzyme photosynthetic pigment rice however gene associated phytohormonesmediated defense ospad osnpr osfmo innate immunity pathway oscebip oscerk found repressed upon glyphosate spray altogether current study first report highlighting overexpression cropspecific tip mutation conjugation glyphosate application showing potential blast disease management rice cultivation,8,"{'Disease': ['osmepsps blast disease management glyphosate foliar spray osmepsps transgenic rice line', 'prophylactic curative suppression blast disease', 'potential blast disease management rice cultivation'], 'Treatment': ['country weed management manual', 'osmepsps blast disease management glyphosate foliar spray osmepsps transgenic rice line', 'potential blast disease management rice cultivation'], 'Symptom': []}",7
32217450,Study on early rice blast diagnosis based on unpre-processed Raman spectral data.,"Traditionally, the rice blast is diagnosed with the naked-eyes. There is an urgent need to provide a method that can identify the early rice blast without symptoms. In the paper, a method for the early rice blast diagnosis based on the Raman spectroscopy was proposed. Considering the compositions of the biological sample are complex, characteristic peaks are severely crossed, the biological fluorescence background and the noise are strong, and the Raman signal is weak. Different data pre-processing methods will lead to different diagnostic accuracies of Raman models, especially for biological samples. This paper proposed a method for modeling a Raman model based on data without pre-processing. In this method, the raw data are decomposed with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Then, based on the self-correlation coefficient of the IMFs and the times of the IMFs crossing the zero Raman Intensity line, IMFs are filtered to get the signal components. Taking the characteristic peaks of the β-carotene, the chlorophyll, and the chitin as the initial characteristic variables, the characteristic variables of the signal components were screened based on Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA). Finally, the obtained characteristic variables were used to establish a Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression model for the rice blast classification, and the test classification accuracy was 94.12%, which was higher than that of models based on spectral data pre-processed by Moving Average Smoothing + Baseline offset, Savitzky Golay Smoothing + Baseline offset, Gaussian Filter Smoothing + Baseline offset and the dB5 wavelet, 3-layer decomposition, Stein Unbiased Risk Estimate, the modulus maximum value method +7 points, 3rd-order Polynomial Fitting.",traditionally rice blast diagnosed nakedeyes urgent need provide method identify early rice blast without symptom paper method early rice blast diagnosis based raman spectroscopy proposed considering composition biological sample complex characteristic peak severely crossed biological fluorescence background noise strong raman signal weak different data preprocessing method lead different diagnostic accuracy raman model especially biological sample paper proposed method modeling raman model based data without preprocessing method raw data decomposed empirical mode decomposition emd several intrinsic mode function imf based selfcorrelation coefficient imf time imf crossing zero raman intensity line imf filtered get signal component taking characteristic peak βcarotene chlorophyll chitin initial characteristic variable characteristic variable signal component screened based successive projection algorithm spa finally obtained characteristic variable used establish partial least square pls regression model rice blast classification test classification accuracy higher model based spectral data preprocessed moving average smoothing baseline offset savitzky golay smoothing baseline offset gaussian filter smoothing baseline offset db wavelet layer decomposition stein unbiased risk estimate modulus maximum value method point rdorder polynomial fitting,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['method', 'symptom paper method', 'weak different data preprocessing method', 'method'], 'Symptom': ['symptom paper method']}",2
38498220,CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Bsr-d1 enhances the blast resistance of rice in Northeast China.,"The blast resistance allele of OsBsr-d1 does not exist in most japonica rice varieties of Jilin Province in China. The development of Bsr-d1 knockout mutants via CRISPR/Cas9 enhances broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast in Northeast China. Rice blast is a global disease that has a significant negative impact on rice yield and quality. Due to the complexity and variability of the physiological races of rice blast, controlling rice blast is challenging in agricultural production. Bsr-d1, a negative transcription factor that confers broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, was identified in the indica rice cultivar Digu; however, its biological function in japonica rice varieties is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the blast resistance allele of Bsr-d1 in a total of 256 japonica rice varieties from Jilin Province in Northeast China and found that this allele was not present in these varieties. Therefore, we generated Bsr-d1 knockout mutants via the CRISPR/Cas9 system using the japonica rice variety Jigeng88 (JG88) as a recipient variety. Compared with those of the wild-type JG88, the homozygous Bsr-d1 mutant lines KO#1 and KO#2 showed enhanced leaf blast resistance at the seedling stage to several Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) races collected from Jilin Province in Northeast China. Physiological and biochemical indices revealed that the homozygous mutant lines produced more hydrogen peroxide than did JG88 plants when infected with M. oryzae. Comparative RNA-seq revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in the synthesis of amide compounds, zinc finger proteins, transmembrane transporters, etc. In summary, our results indicate that the development of Bsr-d1 knockout mutants through CRISPR/Cas9 can enhance the broad-spectrum resistance of rice in Northeast China to rice blast. This study not only provides a theoretical basis for disease resistance breeding involving the Bsr-d1 gene in Northeast China, but also provides new germplasm resources for disease-resistance rice breeding.",blast resistance allele osbsrd exist japonica rice variety jilin province china development bsrd knockout mutant via crisprcas enhances broadspectrum resistance rice blast northeast china rice blast global disease significant negative impact rice yield quality due complexity variability physiological race rice blast controlling rice blast challenging agricultural production bsrd negative transcription factor confers broadspectrum resistance rice blast identified indica rice cultivar digu however biological function japonica rice variety still unclear study analyzed blast resistance allele bsrd total japonica rice variety jilin province northeast china found allele present variety therefore generated bsrd knockout mutant via crisprcas system using japonica rice variety jigeng jg recipient variety compared wildtype jg homozygous bsrd mutant line ko ko showed enhanced leaf blast resistance seedling stage several magnaporthe oryzae oryzae race collected jilin province northeast china physiological biochemical index revealed homozygous mutant line produced hydrogen peroxide jg plant infected oryzae comparative rnaseq revealed degs mainly involved synthesis amide compound zinc finger protein transmembrane transporter etc summary result indicate development bsrd knockout mutant crisprcas enhance broadspectrum resistance rice northeast china rice blast study provides theoretical basis disease resistance breeding involving bsrd gene northeast china also provides new germplasm resource diseaseresistance rice breeding,8,"{'Disease': ['theoretical basis disease resistance breeding', 'new germplasm resource diseaseresistance rice breeding'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10
33845181,Shotgun proteomics coupled to transient-inducible gene silencing reveal rice susceptibility genes as new sources for blast disease resistance.,"A comparative proteomic analysis between two near-isogenic rice lines, displaying a resistant and susceptible phenotype upon infection with Magnaporthe oryzae was performed. We identified and validated factors associated with rice disease susceptibility, representing a flourishing source toward a more resolute rice-blast resistance. Proteome profiles were remarkably different during early infection (12 h post-inoculation), revealing several proteins with increased abundance in the compatible interaction. Potential players of rice susceptibility were selected and gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. Gene Ontology analysis disclosed susceptibility gene-encoded proteins claimed to be involved in fungus sustenance and suppression of plant immunity, such as sucrose synthase 4-like, serpin-ZXA-like, nudix hydrolase15, and DjA2 chaperone protein. Two other candidate genes, picked from a previous transcriptome study, were added into our downstream analysis including pyrabactin resistant-like 5 (OsPYL5), and rice ethylene-responsive factor 104 (OsERF104). Further, we validated their role in susceptibility by Transient-Induced Gene Silencing (TIGS) using short antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides that resulted in a remarkable reduction of foliar disease symptoms in the compatible interaction. Therefore, we successfully employed shotgun proteomics and antisense-based gene silencing to prospect and functionally validate rice potential susceptibility factors, which could be further explored to build rice-blast resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: R gene-mediated disease resistance is race-specific and often not durable in the field. More recently, advancements in new breeding techniques (NBTs) have made plant disease susceptibility genes (S-genes) a new target to build a broad spectrum and more durable resistance, hence an alternative source to R-genes in breeding programs.

32394633,New insights into bsr-d1-mediated broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast.,"bsr-d1, an allele encoding a transcription factor identified from the rice cultivar Digu, confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to infections by strains of Magnaporthe oryzae. bsr-d1 was predicted to inhibit M. oryzae-induced expression of Bsr-d1 RNA and degradation of hydrogen peroxide to achieve resistance to M. oryzae. However, the global effect of biological process and molecular function on blast resistance mediated by Bsr-d1 remains unknown. In this study, we compared transcriptomic profiling between Bsr-d1 knockout (Bsr-d1KO) lines and the wild type, TP309. Our study revealed that bsr-d1 mainly regulates the redox state of plant cells, but also affects amino acid and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. We further found that BSR-D1 indirectly regulates salicylic acid biosynthesis, metabolism, and signal transduction downstream of the activation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> signalling in the bsr-d1-mediated immune response. Furthermore, we identified a novel peroxidase-encoding gene, Perox3, as a new BSR-D1 target gene that reduces resistance to M. oryzae when overexpressed in TP309.

38808386,The F-box protein OsFBX156 positively regulates rice defence against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by mediating ubiquitination-dependent degradation of OsHSP71.1.,"F-box protein is a subunit of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a critical role in regulating different pathways in plant immunity.

38953747,A NAC transcription factor MNAC3-centered regulatory network negatively modulates rice immunity against blast disease.,"NAC transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal in plant immunity against diverse pathogens. Here, we report the functional and regulatory network of MNAC3, a novel NAC TF, in rice immunity. MNAC3, a transcriptional activator, negatively modulates rice immunity against blast and bacterial leaf blight diseases and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immune responses. MNAC3 binds to a CACG cis-element and activates the transcription of immune-negative target genes OsINO80, OsJAZ10, and OsJAZ11. The negative function of MNAC3 in rice immunity depends on its transcription of downstream genes such as OsINO80 and OsJAZ10. MNAC3 interacts with immunity-related OsPP2C41 (a protein phosphatase), ONAC066 (a NAC TF), and OsDjA6 (a DnaJ chaperone). ONAC066 and OsPP2C41 attenuate MNAC3 transcriptional activity, while OsDjA6 promotes it. Phosphorylation of MNAC3 at S163 is critical for its negative functions in rice immunity. OsPP2C41, which plays positive roles in rice blast resistance and chitin-triggered immune responses, dephosphorylates MNAC3, suppressing its transcriptional activity on the target genes OsINO80, OsJAZ10, and OsJAZ11 and promoting the translocation of MNAC3 from nucleus to cytoplasm. These results establish a MNAC3-centered regulatory network in which OsPP2C41 dephosphorylates MNAC3, attenuating its transcriptional activity on downstream immune-negative target genes in rice. Together, these findings deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms in rice immunity and offer a novel strategy for genetic improvement of rice disease resistance.",nac transcription factor tfs pivotal plant immunity diverse pathogen report functional regulatory network mnac novel nac tf rice immunity mnac transcriptional activator negatively modulates rice immunity blast bacterial leaf blight disease pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamptriggered immune response mnac bind cacg ciselement activates transcription immunenegative target gene osino osjaz osjaz negative function mnac rice immunity depends transcription downstream gene osino osjaz mnac interacts immunityrelated osppc protein phosphatase onac nac tf osdja dnaj chaperone onac osppc attenuate mnac transcriptional activity osdja promotes phosphorylation mnac critical negative function rice immunity osppc play positive role rice blast resistance chitintriggered immune response dephosphorylates mnac suppressing transcriptional activity target gene osino osjaz osjaz promoting translocation mnac nucleus cytoplasm result establish mnaccentered regulatory network osppc dephosphorylates mnac attenuating transcriptional activity downstream immunenegative target gene rice together finding deepen understanding molecular mechanism rice immunity offer novel strategy genetic improvement rice disease resistance,1,"{'Disease': ['rice immunity blast bacterial leaf blight disease', 'novel strategy genetic improvement rice disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
26578239,Enhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 in rice.,"Rice is the most important staple food for more than half of the human population, and blast disease is the most serious disease affecting global rice production. In this work, the isoform OsCPK4 of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase family is reported as a regulator of rice immunity to blast fungal infection. It shows that overexpression of OsCPK4 gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration. The constitutive accumulation of OsCPK4 protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and defence gene expression. OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield. Given that OsCPK4 overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways. Altogether, our findings indicate that OsCPK4 is a potential molecular target to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance, but also blast disease resistance of rice crops.",rice important staple food half human population blast disease serious disease affecting global rice production work isoform oscpk rice calciumdependent protein kinase family reported regulator rice immunity blast fungal infection show overexpression oscpk gene rice plant enhances resistance blast disease preventing fungal penetration constitutive accumulation oscpk protein prepares rice plant rapid potentiated defence response including production reactive oxygen specie callose deposition defence gene expression oscpk overexpression lead also constitutive increased content glycosylated salicylic acid hormone leaf without compromising rice yield given oscpk overexpression known confer also salt drought tolerance rice result reported article demonstrate oscpk act convergence component positively modulates biotic abiotic signalling pathway altogether finding indicate oscpk potential molecular target improve abiotic stress tolerance also blast disease resistance rice crop,4,"{'Disease': ['rice important staple food half human population blast disease serious disease', 'resistance blast disease', 'disease resistance rice crop'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
30617050,OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast.,"<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) blast. SNAREs (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen resistance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host resistance to rice blast are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host resistance to rice blast. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the rice blast in both the blast-resistant rice landrace Heikezijing and the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced resistance to blast. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the resistant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i> ::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at rice blast penetration sites in transgenic rice, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to rice blast.

34597396,The OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 defense signaling pathway is shared by two distantly related NLR proteins in rice blast resistance.,"Resistance (R) proteins are important components of plant innate immunity. Most known R proteins are nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Although a number of signaling components downstream of NLRs have been identified, we lack a general understanding of the signaling pathways. Here, we used the interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and Magnaporthe oryzae to study signaling of rice NLRs in response to blast infection. We found that in blast resistance mediated by the NLR PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN DIGU 3 (PID3), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsSPK1 works downstream of PID3. OsSPK1 activates the small GTPase OsRac1, which in turn transduces the signal to the transcription factor RAC IMMUNITY1 (RAI1). Further investigation revealed that the three signaling components also play important roles in disease resistance mediated by the distantly related NLR protein Pi9, suggesting that the OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 signaling pathway could be conserved across rice NLR-induced blast resistance. In addition, we observed changes in RAI1 levels during blast infection, which led to identification of OsRPT2a, a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. OsRPT2a seemed to be responsible for RAI1 turnover in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner.

30632163,Osa-miR398b boosts H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production and rice blast disease-resistance via multiple superoxide dismutases.,"miRNAs contribute to plant resistance against pathogens. Previously, we found that the function of miR398b in immunity in rice differs from that in Arabidopsis. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we characterized the mutants of miR398b target genes and demonstrated that multiple superoxide dismutase genes contribute to miR398b-regulated rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Out of the four target genes of miR398b, mutations in Cu/Zn-Superoxidase Dismutase1 (CSD1), CSD2 and Os11g09780 (Superoxide DismutaseX, SODX) led to enhanced resistance to M. oryzae and increased hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) accumulation. By contrast, mutations in Copper Chaperone for Superoxide Dismutase (CCSD) resulted in enhanced susceptibility. Biochemical studies revealed that csd1, csd2 and sodx displayed altered expression of CSDs and other superoxide dismutase (SOD) family members, leading to increased total SOD enzyme activity that positively contributed to higher H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production. By contrast, the ccsd mutant showed CSD protein deletion, resulting in decreased CSD and total SOD enzyme activity.

32093321,"Rice <i>OsAAA-ATPase1</i> is Induced during Blast Infection in a Salicylic Acid-Dependent Manner, and Promotes Blast Fungus Resistance.","Fatty acids (FAs) have been implicated in signaling roles in plant defense responses. We previously reported that mutation or RNAi-knockdown (<i>OsSSI2</i>-kd) of the rice <i>OsSSI2</i> gene, encoding a stearoyl acyl carrier protein FA desaturase (SACPD), remarkably enhanced resistance to blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and the leaf-blight bacterium <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>). Transcriptomic analysis identified six AAA-ATPase family genes (hereafter <i>OsAAA-ATPase1-6</i>) upregulated in the <i>OsSSI2</i>-kd plants, in addition to other well-known defense-related genes. Here, we report the functional analysis of <i>OsAAA-ATPase1</i> in rice's defense response to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Recombinant OsAAA-ATPase1 synthesized in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed ATPase activity. <i>OsAAA-ATPase1</i> transcription was induced by exogenous treatment with a functional analogue of salicylic acid (SA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), but not by other plant hormones tested.

25014590,"OsNAC111, a blast disease-responsive transcription factor in rice, positively regulates the expression of defense-related genes.","Plants respond to pathogen attack by transcriptionally regulating defense-related genes via various types of transcription factors. We identified a transcription factor in rice, OsNAC111, belonging to the TERN subgroup of the NAC family that was transcriptionally upregulated after rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) inoculation. OsNAC111 was localized in the nucleus of rice cells and had transcriptional activation activity in yeast and rice cells. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNAC111 showed increased resistance to the rice blast fungus. In OsNAC111-overexpressing plants, the expression of several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, was constitutively high compared with the control. These genes all showed blast disease-responsive expression in leaves. Among them, two chitinase genes and one β-1,3-glucanase gene showed reduced expression in transgenic rice plants in which OsNAC111 function was suppressed by a chimeric repressor (OsNAC111-SRDX). OsNAC111 activated transcription from the promoters of the chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase genes in rice cells. In addition, brown pigmentation at the infection sites, a defense response of rice cells to the blast fungus, was lowered in OsNAC111-SRDX plants at the early infection stage. These results indicate that OsNAC111 positively regulates the expression of a specific set of PR genes in the disease response and contributes to disease resistance.",plant respond pathogen attack transcriptionally regulating defenserelated gene via various type transcription factor identified transcription factor rice osnac belonging tern subgroup nac family transcriptionally upregulated rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae inoculation osnac localized nucleus rice cell transcriptional activation activity yeast rice cell transgenic rice plant overexpressing osnac showed increased resistance rice blast fungus osnacoverexpressing plant expression several defenserelated gene including pathogenesisrelated pr gene constitutively high compared control gene showed blast diseaseresponsive expression leaf among two chitinase gene one βglucanase gene showed reduced expression transgenic rice plant osnac function suppressed chimeric repressor osnacsrdx osnac activated transcription promoter chitinase βglucanase gene rice cell addition brown pigmentation infection site defense response rice cell blast fungus lowered osnacsrdx plant early infection stage result indicate osnac positively regulates expression specific set pr gene disease response contributes disease resistance,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae inoculation osnac', 'increased resistance rice blast fungus osnacoverexpressing plant expression', 'blast diseaseresponsive expression leaf', 'expression specific set pr gene disease response', 'disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

Here, we reported the isolation of blast R gene Pid4 using comparative transcriptomic profiling and genome-wide sequence analysis. Pid4 encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein and is constitutively expressed at diverse developmental stages in the rice variety Digu. The Pid4 protein is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Introduction of Pid4 into susceptible rice cultivars confers race-specific resistance to leaf and neck blast. Amino acid sequence comparison and blast resistance spectrum tests showed that Pid4 is a novel R gene, different from the previously reported R genes located in the same gene cluster. A Pid4 Indel marker was developed to facilitate the identification of Pid4 in different rice varieties.

35705042,A rice protein modulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and coordinates with a transcription factor to initiate blast disease resistance.,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is essential for plants to manage responses under environmental stress. Plant immune activation requires the ER, but how ER homeostasis is associated with plant immune activation is largely unexplored. Here we find that transcription of an HVA22 family gene, OsHLP1 (HVA22-like protein 1), is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsHLP1 significantly enhances blast disease resistance but impairs ER morphology in rice (Oryza sativa), resulting in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress. OsHLP1 interacts with the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor OsNTL6 at the ER. OsNTL6 localizes to the ER and is relocated to the nucleus after cleavage of the transmembrane domain. OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants. These findings unravel a mechanism whereby OsHLP1 promotes disease resistance by compromising ER homeostasis when plants are infected by pathogens.",endoplasmic reticulum er homeostasis essential plant manage response environmental stress plant immune activation requires er er homeostasis associated plant immune activation largely unexplored find transcription hva family gene oshlp hvalike protein induced magnaporthe oryzae infection overexpression oshlp significantly enhances blast disease resistance impairs er morphology rice oryza sativa resulting enhanced sensitivity er stress oshlp interacts nac nam ataf cuc transcription factor osntl er osntl localizes er relocated nucleus cleavage transmembrane domain oshlp suppresses osntl protein accumulation whereas osntl counteracts oshlp alleviating sensitivity er stress decreasing disease resistance oshlp overexpression plant finding unravel mechanism whereby oshlp promotes disease resistance compromising er homeostasis plant infected pathogen,6,"{'Disease': ['sensitivity er stress decreasing disease resistance', 'disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
37794842,The GRAS protein OsDLA involves in brassinosteroid signalling and positively regulates blast resistance by forming a module with GSK2 and OsWRKY53 in rice.,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a crucial role in shaping the architecture of rice (Oryza sativa) plants. However, the regulatory mechanism of BR signalling in rice immunity remains largely unexplored. Here we identify a rice mutant dla, which exhibits decreased leaf angles and is insensitive to 24-epiBL (a highly active synthetic BR), resembling the BR-deficient phenotype. The dla mutation caused by a T-DNA insertion in the OsDLA gene leads to downregulation of the causative gene. The OsDLA knockout plants display reduced leaf angles and less sensitivity to 24-epiBL. In addition, both dla mutant and OsDLA knockout plants are more susceptible to rice blast compared to the wild type. OsDLA is a GRAS transcription factor and interacts with the BR signalling core negative regulator, GSK2. GSK2 phosphorylates OsDLA for degradation via the 26S proteasome. The GSK2 RNAi line exhibits enhanced rice blast resistance, while the overexpression lines thereof show susceptibility to rice blast. Furthermore, we show that OsDLA interacts with and stabilizes the WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY53, which has been demonstrated to positively regulate BR signalling and blast resistance. OsWRKY53 directly binds the promoter of PBZ1 and activates its expression, and this activation can be enhanced by OsDLA. Together, our findings unravel a novel mechanism whereby the GSK2-OsDLA-OsWRKY53 module coordinates blast resistance and plant architecture via BR signalling in rice.",brassinosteroids br play crucial role shaping architecture rice oryza sativa plant however regulatory mechanism br signalling rice immunity remains largely unexplored identify rice mutant dla exhibit decreased leaf angle insensitive epibl highly active synthetic br resembling brdeficient phenotype dla mutation caused tdna insertion osdla gene lead downregulation causative gene osdla knockout plant display reduced leaf angle less sensitivity epibl addition dla mutant osdla knockout plant susceptible rice blast compared wild type osdla gras transcription factor interacts br signalling core negative regulator gsk gsk phosphorylates osdla degradation via proteasome gsk rnai line exhibit enhanced rice blast resistance overexpression line thereof show susceptibility rice blast furthermore show osdla interacts stabilizes wrky transcription factor oswrky demonstrated positively regulate br signalling blast resistance oswrky directly bind promoter pbz activates expression activation enhanced osdla together finding unravel novel mechanism whereby gskosdlaoswrky module coordinate blast resistance plant architecture via br signalling rice,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

However, the miRNA species have not been explored for rice (Oryza sativa) immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the most devastating fungal pathogen in rice production worldwide. Here, by deep sequencing small RNA libraries from susceptible and resistant lines in normal conditions and upon M. oryzae infection, we identified a group of known rice miRNAs that were differentially expressed upon M. oryzae infection. They were further classified into three classes based on their expression patterns in the susceptible japonica line Lijiangxin Tuan Hegu and in the resistant line International Rice Blast Line Pyricularia-Kanto51-m-Tsuyuake that contains a single resistance gene locus, Pyricularia-Kanto 51-m (Pikm), within the Lijiangxin Tuan Hegu background. RNA-blot assay of nine of them confirmed sequencing results. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay showed that the expression of some target genes was negatively correlated with the expression of miRNAs. Moreover, transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR160a and miR398b displayed enhanced resistance to M. oryzae, as demonstrated by decreased fungal growth, increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation at the infection site, and up-regulated expression of defense-related genes.

25586962,Gene pyramiding enhances durable blast disease resistance in rice.,"Effective control of blast, a devastating fungal disease of rice, would increase and stabilize worldwide food production. Resistance mediated by quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which usually have smaller individual effects than R-genes but confer broad-spectrum or non-race-specific resistance, is a promising alternative to less durable race-specific resistance for crop improvement, yet evidence that validates the impact of QTL combinations (pyramids) on the durability of plant disease resistance has been lacking. Here, we developed near-isogenic experimental lines representing all possible combinations of four QTL alleles from a durably resistant cultivar. These lines enabled us to evaluate the QTLs singly and in combination in a homogeneous genetic background. We present evidence that pyramiding QTL alleles, each controlling a different response to M. oryzae, confers strong, non-race-specific, environmentally stable resistance to blast disease.

A total of 40 haplotypes were identified based on 71 nucleotide polymorphic sites among 2621 Pid3 homozygous alleles in the 3k genomes. Pid3 alleles in most japonica rice accessions were pseudogenes due to premature stop mutations, while those in most indica rice accessions were identical to the functional haplotype Hap_6, which had a similar resistance spectrum as the previously reported Pid3 gene. By sequencing and CAPS marker analyzing the Pid3 alleles in widespread cultivars in China, we verified that Hap_6 had been widely deployed in indica rice breeding of China.

39087779,A novel Pik allele confers extended resistance to rice blast.,"In the ongoing arms race between rice and Magnaporthe oryzae, the pathogen employs effectors to evade the immune response, while the host develops resistance genes to recognise these effectors and confer resistance. In this study, we identified a novel Pik allele, Pik-W25, from wild rice WR25 through bulked-segregant analysis, creating the Pik-W25 NIL (Near-isogenic Lines) named G9. Pik-W25 conferred resistance to isolates expressing AvrPik-C/D/E alleles. CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to generate transgenic lines with a loss of function in Pik-W25-1 and Pik-W25-2, resulting in loss of resistance in G9 to isolates expressing the three alleles, confirming that Pik-W25-induced immunity required both Pik-W25-1 and Pik-W25-2. Yeast two-hybrid (Y<sub>2</sub>H) and split luciferase complementation assays showed interactions between Pik-W25-1 and the three alleles, while Pik-W25-2 could not interact with AvrPik-C, -D, and -E alleles with Y<sub>2</sub>H assay, indicating Pik-W25-1 acts as an adaptor and Pik-W25-2 transduces the signal to trigger resistance. The Pik-W25 NIL exhibited enhanced field resistance to leaf and panicle blast without significant changes in morphology or development compared to the parent variety CO39, suggesting its potential for resistance breeding.

In this study, we demonstrated that M. oryzae MoAo1 is an AO that plays a role in virulence by modulating the apoplast redox status of rice cells. We showed that MoAo1 inhibits the activity of rice OsAO3 and OsAO4, which also regulate the apoplast redox status and plant immunity.

27631432,The germin-like protein OsGLP2-1 enhances resistance to fungal blast and bacterial blight in rice.,"This is the first report that GLP gene (OsGLP2-1) is involved in panicle blast and bacterial blight resistance in rice. In addition to its resistance to blast and bacterial blight, OsGLP2-1 has also been reported to co-localize with a QTLs for sheath blight resistance in rice. These suggest that the disease resistance provided by OsGLP2-1 is quantitative and broad spectrum. Its good resistance to these major diseases in rice makes it to be a promising target in rice breeding. Rice (Oryza sativa) blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae are the two most destructive rice diseases worldwide. Germin-like protein (GLP) gene family is one of the important defense gene families which have been reported to be involved in disease resistance in plants. Although GLP proteins have been demonstrated to positively regulate leaf blast resistance in rice, their involvement in resistance to panicle blast and bacterial blight, has not been reported. In this study, we reported that one of the rice GLP genes, OsGLP2-1, was significantly induced by blast fungus. Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight. The temporal and spatial expression analysis revealed that OsGLP2-1is highly expressed in leaves and panicles and sub-localized in the cell wall. Compared with empty vector transformed (control) plants, the OsGLP2-1 overexpressing plants exhibited higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> both before and after pathogen inoculation. Moreover, OsGLP2-1 was significantly induced by jasmonic acid (JA). Overexpression of OsGLP2-1 induced three well-characterized defense-related genes which are associated in JA-dependent pathway after pathogen infection. Higher endogenous level of JA was also identified in OsGLP2-1 overexpressing plants than in control plants both before and after pathogen inoculation. Together, these results suggest that OsGLP2-1 functions as a positive regulator to modulate disease resistance.

24884531,Natural rice rhizospheric microbes suppress rice blast infections.,"The natural interactions between plant roots and their rhizospheric microbiome are vital to plant fitness, modulating both growth promotion and disease suppression. In rice (Oryza sativa), a globally important food crop, as much as 30% of yields are lost due to blast disease caused by fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Capitalizing on the abilities of naturally occurring rice soil bacteria to reduce M. oryzae infections could provide a sustainable solution to reduce the amount of crops lost to blast disease. Naturally occurring root-associated rhizospheric bacteria were isolated from California field grown rice plants (M-104), eleven of which were taxonomically identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Bacterial isolates were tested for biocontrol activity against the devastating foliar rice fungal pathogen, M. oryzae pathovar 70-15. In vitro, a Pseudomonas isolate, EA105, displayed antibiosis through reducing appressoria formation by nearly 90% as well as directly inhibiting fungal growth by 76%. Although hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a volatile commonly produced by biocontrol pseudomonads, the activity of EA105 seems to be independent of its HCN production. During in planta experiments, EA105 reduced the number of blast lesions formed by 33% and Pantoea agglomerans isolate, EA106 by 46%. Our data also show both EA105 and EA106 trigger jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) dependent induced systemic resistance (ISR) response in rice. Out of 11 bacteria isolated from rice soil, pseudomonad EA105 most effectively inhibited the growth and appressoria formation of M. oryzae through a mechanism that is independent of cyanide production. In addition to direct antagonism, EA105 also appears to trigger ISR in rice plants through a mechanism that is dependent on JA and ET signaling, ultimately resulting in fewer blast lesions.

Here, we investigated how differences in CPD photolyase activity affect plant resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, which is one of the other major stresses. We used Asian and African rice cultivars and transgenic lines with different CPD photolyase activities to evaluate the interaction effects of CPD photolyase activity on resistance to M. oryzae. In UVB-resistant rice plants overexpressing CPD photolyase, 12 h of low-dose UVB (0.4 W m<sup>-2</sup>) pretreatment enhanced sensitivity to M. oryzae. In contrast, UVB-sensitive rice (transgenic rice with antisense CPD photolyase, A-S; and rice cultivars with low CPD photolyase activity) showed resistance to M. oryzae. Several defense-related genes were upregulated in UVB-sensitive rice compared to UVB-resistant rice. UVB-pretreated A-S plants showed decreased multicellular infection and robust accumulation of reactive oxygen species. High UVB-induced CPD accumulation promoted defense responses and cross-protection mechanisms against rice blast disease.

25761210,QTL Analysis for Resistance to Blast Disease in U.S. Weedy Rice.,"Understanding the genetic architecture of adaptation is of great importance in evolutionary biology. U.S. weedy rice is well adapted to the local conditions in U.S. rice fields. Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of cultivated rice worldwide. However, information about resistance to blast in weedy rice is limited. Here, we evaluated the disease reactions of 60 U.S. weedy rice accessions with 14 blast races, and investigated the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with blast resistance in two major ecotypes of U.S. weedy rice. Our results revealed that U.S. weedy rice exhibited a broad resistance spectrum. Using genotyping by sequencing, we identified 28 resistance QTL in two U.S. weedy rice ecotypes.

35877779,"Maintenance of divergent lineages of the Rice Blast Fungus Pyricularia oryzae through niche separation, loss of sex and post-mating genetic incompatibilities.","Many species of fungal plant pathogens coexist as multiple lineages on the same host, but the factors underlying the origin and maintenance of population structure remain largely unknown. The rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae is a widespread model plant pathogen displaying population subdivision. However, most studies of natural variation in P. oryzae have been limited in genomic or geographic resolution, and host adaptation is the only factor that has been investigated extensively as a contributor to population subdivision. In an effort to complement previous studies, we analyzed genetic and phenotypic diversity in isolates of the rice blast fungus covering a broad geographical range. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping data for 886 isolates sampled from 152 sites in 51 countries, we showed that population subdivision of P. oryzae in one recombining and three clonal lineages with broad distributions persisted with deeper sampling. We also extended previous findings by showing further population subdivision of the recombining lineage into one international and three Asian clusters, and by providing evidence that the three clonal lineages of P. oryzae were found in areas with different prevailing environmental conditions, indicating niche separation. Pathogenicity tests and bioinformatic analyses using an extended set of isolates and rice varieties indicated that partial specialization to rice subgroups contributed to niche separation between lineages, and differences in repertoires of putative virulence effectors were consistent with differences in host range. Experimental crosses revealed that female sterility and early post-mating genetic incompatibilities acted as strong additional barriers to gene flow between clonal lineages. Our results demonstrate that the spread of a fungal pathogen across heterogeneous habitats and divergent populations of a crop species can lead to niche separation and reproductive isolation between distinct, widely distributed, lineages.",many specie fungal plant pathogen coexist multiple lineage host factor underlying origin maintenance population structure remain largely unknown rice blast fungus pyricularia oryzae widespread model plant pathogen displaying population subdivision however study natural variation p oryzae limited genomic geographic resolution host adaptation factor investigated extensively contributor population subdivision effort complement previous study analyzed genetic phenotypic diversity isolates rice blast fungus covering broad geographical range using singlenucleotide polymorphism genotyping data isolates sampled site country showed population subdivision p oryzae one recombining three clonal lineage broad distribution persisted deeper sampling also extended previous finding showing population subdivision recombining lineage one international three asian cluster providing evidence three clonal lineage p oryzae found area different prevailing environmental condition indicating niche separation pathogenicity test bioinformatic analysis using extended set isolates rice variety indicated partial specialization rice subgroup contributed niche separation lineage difference repertoire putative virulence effector consistent difference host range experimental cross revealed female sterility early postmating genetic incompatibility acted strong additional barrier gene flow clonal lineage result demonstrate spread fungal pathogen across heterogeneous habitat divergent population crop specie lead niche separation reproductive isolation distinct widely distributed lineage,13,"{'Disease': ['largely unknown rice blast fungus pyricularia', 'rice blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['niche separation lineage difference repertoire putative virulence effector consistent difference host range experimental cross']}",2
24892523,Overexpression of phosphomimic mutated OsWRKY53 leads to enhanced blast resistance in rice.,"WRKY transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been shown to play pivotal roles in the regulation of plant defense responses. We previously reported that OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants showed enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. In this study, we identified OsWRKY53 as a substrate of OsMPK3/OsMPK6, components of a fungal PAMP-responsive MAPK cascade in rice, and analyzed the effect of OsWRKY53 phosphorylation on the regulation of basal defense responses to a virulence race of rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae strain Ina86-137. An in vitro phosphorylation assay revealed that the OsMPK3/OsMPK6 activated by OsMKK4 phosphorylated OsWRKY53 recombinant protein at its multiple clustered serine-proline residues (SP cluster). When OsWRKY53 was coexpressed with a constitutively active mutant of OsMKK4 in a transient reporter gene assay, the enhanced transactivation activity of OsWRKY53 was found to be dependent on phosphorylation of the SP cluster. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing a phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 (OsWRKY53SD) showed further-enhanced disease resistance to the blast fungus compared to native OsWRKY53-overexpressing rice plants, and a substantial number of defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes, were more upregulated in the OsWRKY53SD-overexpressing plants compared to the OsWRKY53-overexpressing plants. These results strongly suggest that the OsMKK4-OsMPK3/OsMPK6 cascade regulates transactivation activity of OsWRKY53, and overexpression of the phospho-mimic mutant of OsWRKY53 results in a major change to the rice transcriptome at steady state that leads to activation of a defense response against the blast fungus in rice plants.",wrky transcription factor mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk cascade shown play pivotal role regulation plant defense response previously reported oswrkyoverexpressing rice plant showed enhanced resistance rice blast fungus study identified oswrky substrate osmpkosmpk component fungal pampresponsive mapk cascade rice analyzed effect oswrky phosphorylation regulation basal defense response virulence race rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae strain ina vitro phosphorylation assay revealed osmpkosmpk activated osmkk phosphorylated oswrky recombinant protein multiple clustered serineproline residue sp cluster oswrky coexpressed constitutively active mutant osmkk transient reporter gene assay enhanced transactivation activity oswrky found dependent phosphorylation sp cluster transgenic rice plant overexpressing phosphomimic mutant oswrky oswrkysd showed furtherenhanced disease resistance blast fungus compared native oswrkyoverexpressing rice plant substantial number defenserelated gene including pathogenesisrelated protein gene upregulated oswrkysdoverexpressing plant compared oswrkyoverexpressing plant result strongly suggest osmkkosmpkosmpk cascade regulates transactivation activity oswrky overexpression phosphomimic mutant oswrky result major change rice transcriptome steady state lead activation defense response blast fungus rice plant,12,"{'Disease': ['enhanced resistance rice blast fungus study', 'furtherenhanced disease resistance blast fungus', 'steady state lead activation defense response blast fungus rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8

The major biological activity of NO is protein S-nitrosylation, whose function in fungi remains largely unclear. Here, it is found in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, de-nitrosylation process is essential for functional appressorium formation during infection. Nitrosative stress caused by excessive accumulation of NO is harmful for fungal infection. While the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase GSNOR-mediated de-nitrosylation removes excess NO toxicity during appressorium formation to promote infection. Through an indoTMT switch labeling proteomics technique, 741 S-nitrosylation sites in 483 proteins are identified. Key appressorial proteins, such as Mgb1, MagB, Sps1, Cdc42, and septins, are activated by GSNOR through de-nitrosylation. Removing S-nitrosylation sites of above proteins is essential for proper protein structure and appressorial function. Therefore, GSNOR-mediated de-nitrosylation is an essential regulator for appressorium formation.

However, only a few immediate downstream targets of R proteins have been characterized, and the signalling pathways for R-protein-induced immunity are largely unknown. In rice (Oryza sativa), NLR proteins serve as important immune receptors in the response to rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We used site-directed mutagenesis to create an autoactive form of the NLR protein PID3 that confers blast resistance and used transgenic rice to test the resulting immunity and gene expression changes. We identified OsRac1, a known GTPase, as a signalling molecule in PID3-mediated blast resistance, implicating OsRac1 as a possible common factor downstream of rice NLR proteins. We also identified RAI1, a transcriptional activator, as a PID3 interactor required for PID3-mediated blast resistance and showed that RAI1 expression is induced by PID3 via a process mediated by OsRac1.

27888533,Advances in understanding broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens in rice.,"Rice diseases caused by multiple pathogen species are a major obstacle to achieving optimal yield. Using host pathogen species-non-specific broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) for rice improvement is an efficient way to control diseases. Recent advances in rice genomics and improved understanding of the mechanisms of rice-pathogen interactions have shown that using a single gene to improve rice BSR to multiple pathogen species is technically possible and the necessary resources exist. A variety of rice genes, including major disease resistance genes and defense-responsive genes, which function in pattern-triggered immunity signaling, effector-triggered immunity signaling or quantitative resistance, can mediate BSR to two or more pathogen species independently. These genes encode diverse proteins and function differently in promoting disease resistance, thus providing a relatively broad choice for different breeding programs. This updated knowledge will facilitate rice improvement with pathogen species-non-specific BSR via gene marker-assisted selection or biotechnological approaches.",rice disease caused multiple pathogen specie major obstacle achieving optimal yield using host pathogen speciesnonspecific broadspectrum resistance bsr rice improvement efficient way control disease recent advance rice genomics improved understanding mechanism ricepathogen interaction shown using single gene improve rice bsr multiple pathogen specie technically possible necessary resource exist variety rice gene including major disease resistance gene defenseresponsive gene function patterntriggered immunity signaling effectortriggered immunity signaling quantitative resistance mediate bsr two pathogen specie independently gene encode diverse protein function differently promoting disease resistance thus providing relatively broad choice different breeding program updated knowledge facilitate rice improvement pathogen speciesnonspecific bsr via gene markerassisted selection biotechnological approach,1,"{'Disease': ['rice disease', 'host pathogen speciesnonspecific broadspectrum resistance bsr rice improvement efficient way control disease', 'major disease resistance gene defenseresponsive gene function', 'disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effectortriggered immunity']}",13

Alpha-momorcharin (α-MC), a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) isolated from Momordica charantia seeds, has antifungal effects in vitro. In this study, the α-MC gene was constitutively expressed under the control of the 2×35S promoter in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method. The nine transgenic plants were obtained and confirmed by PCR and RT-PCR, and the four (B2, B4, B7 and B9) of them whose copy numbers were 1, 2, 3 and 3, respectively, were shown to express the α-MC protein by Western blot. The molecular weight of α-MC in transgenic plants was approximately 38 kDa larger than the purified α-MC protein (28 kDa) in vitro. When the confirmed T1 generations were inoculated with a suspension of M. grisea spores for ten days, the lesions on leaves of transgenic plants were much lesser than those found on wild type (WT). According to the criteria of International Rice Research Institute standard, the mean values for morbidity and disease index numbers were 29.8% and 14.9%, respectively, which were lower than for WT.

28220688,The DnaJ protein OsDjA6 negatively regulates rice innate immunity to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (synonym: Pyricularia oryzae), severely reduces rice production and grain quality. The molecular mechanism of rice resistance to M. oryzae is not fully understood. In this study, we identified a chaperone DnaJ protein, OsDjA6, which is involved in basal resistance to M. oryzae in rice. The OsDjA6 protein is distributed in the entire rice cell. The expression of OsDjA6 is significantly induced in rice after infection with a compatible isolate. Silencing of OsDjA6 in transgenic rice enhances resistance to M. oryzae and also results in an increased burst of reactive oxygen species after flg22 and chitin treatments. In addition, the expression levels of WRKY45, NPR1 and PR5 are increased in OsDjA6 RNAi plants, indicating that OsDjA6 may mediate resistance by affecting the salicylic acid pathway. Finally, we found that OsDjA6 interacts directly with the E3 ligase OsZFP1 in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the DnaJ protein OsDjA6 negatively regulates rice innate immunity, probably via the ubiquitination proteasome degradation pathway.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae synonym pyricularia oryzae severely reduces rice production grain quality molecular mechanism rice resistance oryzae fully understood study identified chaperone dnaj protein osdja involved basal resistance oryzae rice osdja protein distributed entire rice cell expression osdja significantly induced rice infection compatible isolate silencing osdja transgenic rice enhances resistance oryzae also result increased burst reactive oxygen specie flg chitin treatment addition expression level wrky npr pr increased osdja rnai plant indicating osdja may mediate resistance affecting salicylic acid pathway finally found osdja interacts directly e ligase oszfp vitro vivo result suggest dnaj protein osdja negatively regulates rice innate immunity probably via ubiquitination proteasome degradation pathway,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

Currently, planting cultivars with resistance (<i>R</i>) genes is still the most environment-friendly approach to control this disease. Effective identification of <i>R</i> genes existing in diverse rice cultivars is important for understanding the distribution of <i>R</i> genes and predicting their contribution to resistance against blast isolates in regional breeding.

31655345,Adaptation of the metabolomics profile of rice after Pyricularia oryzae infection.,"Pyricularia oryzae (P. oryzae), one of the most devastating fungal pathogens, is the cause of blast disease in rice. Infection with a blast fungus induces biological responses in the host plant that lead to its survival through the termination or suppression of pathogen growth, and metabolite compounds play vital roles in plant interactions with a wide variety of other organisms. Numerous studies have indicated that rice has a multi-layered plant immune system that includes pre-developed (e.g., cell wall and phytoanticipins), constitutive and inducible (phytoalexins) defence barriers against stresses. Significant progress towards understanding the basis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the defence responses of rice to P. oryzae has been achieved. Nonetheless, even though the important metabolites in the responses of rice to pathogens have been identified, their exact mechanisms and their contributions to plant immunity against blast fungi have not been elucidated.

30857220,Every Coin Has Two Sides: Reactive Oxygen Species during Rice⁻<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Interaction.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in many important processes, including the growth, development, and responses to the environments, in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.

Recent studies have provided fascinating insights into the intricate physiological redox balance in rice⁻<i>M. oryzae</i> interactions. In <i>M. oryzae</i>, ROS accumulation is required for the appressorium formation and penetration. However, once inside the rice cells, <i>M. oryzae</i> must scavenge the host-derived ROS to spread invasive hyphae. On the other side, ROS play key roles in rice against <i>M. oryzae</i>. It has been known that, upon perception of <i>M. oryzae</i>, rice plants modulate their activities of ROS generating and scavenging enzymes, mainly on NADPH oxidase OsRbohB, by different signaling pathways to accumulate ROS against rice blast. By contrast, the <i>M. oryzae</i> virulent strains are capable of suppressing ROS accumulation and attenuating rice blast resistance by the secretion of effectors, such as AvrPii and AvrPiz-t.

In vitro experiments were conducted on fresh leaves of Khao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) jasmine rice seedlings. The results showed that NP19 effectively inhibited the germination of P. oryzae fungal conidia. Fungal infection was suppressed across three different treatment conditions: rice colonized with NP19 and inoculated by fungal conidia, a mix of NP19 and fungal conidia concurrently inoculated on the leaves, and fungal conidia inoculation first followed by NP19 inoculation after 30 h. Additionally, NP19 reduced fungal mycelial growth by 9.9-53.4%. In pot experiments, NP19 enhanced the activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 6.1-63.0% and 3.0-67.7%, respectively, indicating a boost in the plant's defense mechanisms. Compared to the uncolonized control, the NP19-colonized rice had 0.3-24.7% more pigment contents, 4.1% more filled grains per panicle, 26.3% greater filled grain yield, 34.4% higher harvest index, and 10.1% more content of the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP); for rice colonized with NP19 and infected with P. oryzae, these increases were 0.2-49.2%, 4.6%, 9.1%, 54.4%, and 7.5%, respectively. In field experiments, blast-infected rice that was colonized and/or inoculated with NP19 treatments had 15.1-27.2% more filled grains per panicle, 103.6-119.8% greater filled grain yield, and 18.0-35.8% higher 2AP content. A higher SOD activity (6.9-29.5%) was also observed in the above-mentioned rice than in the blast-infected rice that was not colonized and inoculated with NP19. Following blast infection, NP19 applied to leaves decreased blast lesion progression.

In resistant rice, all PA started to accumulate at 2 days postinoculation (dpi), at which hypersensitive reaction (HR)-specific small lesions became visible and increased 500- to 1,000-fold at 4 dpi, while the accumulation was delayed and several times lower in susceptible rice. Expression of PA biosynthetic genes was transiently induced at 2 dpi only in resistant plants, while it was highly induced in both plants at 4 dpi. Fungal growth was severely suppressed in resistant plants by 2 dpi but considerably increased at 3 to 4 dpi in susceptible plants. Momilactone A treatment suppressed fungal growth in planta and in vitro, and the fungus detoxified the PA in vitro. These results indicate that HR-associated rapid PA biosynthesis induces severe restriction of fungus, allowing higher PA accumulation in resistant rice, while in susceptible rice, failure of PA accumulation at the early infection stage allows fungal growth.

On the host side, the composition of resistance in the cultivar differential set could be divided in two: the three <i>indica</i>-type entries of the differential set expressed a higher level of resistance to the population of <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates tested than did the four <i>japonica</i>-type entries. The cultivars Tetep and Zhenlong 13 as well as two additional resistance genes α and ε were confirmed as the most promising donors of blast resistance for the local rice improvement programs.[Formula: see text]Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

25869921,Development and evaluation of near-isogenic lines for major blast resistance gene(s) in Basmati rice.,"A set of NILs carrying major blast resistance genes in a Basmati rice variety has been developed. Also, the efficacy of pyramids over monogenic NILs against rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae has been demonstrated. Productivity and quality of Basmati rice is severely affected by rice blast disease. Major genes and QTLs conferring resistance to blast have been reported only in non-Basmati rice germplasm. Here, we report incorporation of seven blast resistance genes from the donor lines DHMASQ164-2a (Pi54, Pi1, Pita), IRBLz5-CA (Pi2), IRBLb-B (Pib), IRBL5-M (Pi5) and IRBL9-W (Pi9) into the genetic background of an elite Basmati rice variety Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1). A total of 36 near-isogenic lines (NILs) comprising of 14 monogenic, 16 two-gene pyramids and six three-gene pyramids were developed through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Foreground, recombinant and background selection was used to identify the plants with target gene(s), minimize the linkage drag and increase the recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery (93.5-98.6 %), respectively, in the NILs. Comparative analysis performed using 50,051 SNPs and 500 SSR markers revealed that the SNPs provided better insight into the RPG recovery. Most of the monogenic NILs showed comparable performance in yield and quality, concomitantly, Pusa1637-18-7-6-20 (Pi9), was significantly superior in yield and stable across four different environments as compared to recurrent parent (RP) PB1. Further, among the pyramids, Pusa1930-12-6 (Pi2+Pi5) showed significantly higher yield and Pusa1633-7-8-53-6-8 (Pi54+Pi1+Pita) was superior in cooking quality as compared to RP PB1. The NILs carrying gene Pi9 were found to be the most effective against the concoction of virulent races predominant in the hotspot locations for blast disease. Conversely, when analyzed under artificial inoculation, three-gene pyramids expressed enhanced resistance as compared to the two-gene and monogenic NILs.",set nil carrying major blast resistance gene basmati rice variety developed also efficacy pyramid monogenic nil rice blast pathogen magnaporthe oryzae demonstrated productivity quality basmati rice severely affected rice blast disease major gene qtls conferring resistance blast reported nonbasmati rice germplasm report incorporation seven blast resistance gene donor line dhmasqa pi pi pita irblzca pi irblbb pib irblm pi irblw pi genetic background elite basmati rice variety pusa basmati pb total nearisogenic line nil comprising monogenic twogene pyramid six threegene pyramid developed markerassisted backcross breeding mabb foreground recombinant background selection used identify plant target gene minimize linkage drag increase recurrent parent genome rpg recovery respectively nil comparative analysis performed using snp ssr marker revealed snp provided better insight rpg recovery monogenic nil showed comparable performance yield quality concomitantly pusa pi significantly superior yield stable across four different environment compared recurrent parent rp pb among pyramid pusa pipi showed significantly higher yield pusa pipipita superior cooking quality compared rp pb nil carrying gene pi found effective concoction virulent race predominant hotspot location blast disease conversely analyzed artificial inoculation threegene pyramid expressed enhanced resistance compared twogene monogenic nil,10,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease major gene qtls conferring resistance blast', 'effective concoction virulent race predominant hotspot location blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective concoction virulent race predominant hotspot location blast disease']}",13
30501464,Dynamic Insertion of Pot3 in <i>AvrPib</i> Prevailing in a Field Rice Blast Population in the Philippines Led to the High Virulence Frequency Against the Resistance Gene <i>Pib</i> in Rice.,"The <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> avirulence gene <i>AvrPib</i> is required for the resistance mediated by its cognate resistance gene <i>Pib</i>, which has been intensively used in <i>indica</i> rice breeding programs in many Asian countries. However, the sequence diversity of <i>AvrPib</i> among geographically distinct <i>M. oryzae</i> populations was recently shown to be increasing. Here, we selected a field population consisting of 248 rice blast isolates collected from a disease hotspot in Philippine for the analysis of <i>AvrPib</i> haplotypes and their pathogenicity against <i>Pib</i>. We found that all of the isolates were virulent to <i>Pib</i> and each of them contained an insertion of Pot3 transposon in <i>AvrPib</i>. Moreover, Pot3 insertion was detected in different genomic positions, resulting in three different <i>AvrPib</i> haplotypes, designated avrPib-H1 to H3. We further conducted a genome-wide Pot2 fingerprinting analysis by repetitive element palindromic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and identified seven different lineages out of 47 representative isolates. The isolates belonging to the same lineage often had the same <i>AvrPib</i> haplotype. In contrast, the isolates having the same <i>AvrPib</i> haplotypes did not always belong to the same lineages. Both mating types MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 were identified in the population in Bohol and the latter appeared dominant. On the host side, we found that 32 of 52 released rice varieties in the Philippines contained <i>Pib</i> diagnosed by PCR gene-specific primers and DNA sequencing of gene amplicons, suggesting that it was widely incorporated in different rice varieties. Our study highlights the genetic dynamics of rice blast population at both the <i>AvrPib</i> locus and the genome-wide levels, providing insight into the mechanisms of the mutations in <i>AvrPib</i> leading to the breakdown of <i>Pib</i>-mediated resistance in rice.",imagnaporthe oryzaei avirulence gene iavrpibi required resistance mediated cognate resistance gene ipibi intensively used iindicai rice breeding program many asian country however sequence diversity iavrpibi among geographically distinct im oryzaei population recently shown increasing selected field population consisting rice blast isolates collected disease hotspot philippine analysis iavrpibi haplotype pathogenicity ipibi found isolates virulent ipibi contained insertion pot transposon iavrpibi moreover pot insertion detected different genomic position resulting three different iavrpibi haplotype designated avrpibh h conducted genomewide pot fingerprinting analysis repetitive element palindromic polymerase chain reaction pcr identified seven different lineage representative isolates isolates belonging lineage often iavrpibi haplotype contrast isolates iavrpibi haplotype always belong lineage mating type mat mat identified population bohol latter appeared dominant host side found released rice variety philippine contained ipibi diagnosed pcr genespecific primer dna sequencing gene amplicons suggesting widely incorporated different rice variety study highlight genetic dynamic rice blast population iavrpibi locus genomewide level providing insight mechanism mutation iavrpibi leading breakdown ipibimediated resistance rice,13,"{'Disease': ['collected disease hotspot'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13
30468014,Comparative Nuclear Proteomics Analysis Provides Insight into the Mechanism of Signaling and Immune Response to Blast Disease Caused by Magnaporthe oryzae in Rice.,"Modulation of plant immune system by extrinsic/intrinsic factors and host-specific determinants fine-tunes cellular components involving multiple organelles, particularly nucleus to mount resistance against pathogen attack. Rice blast, caused by hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases that adversely affect rice productivity. However, the role of nuclear proteins and their regulation in response to M. oryzae remains unknown. Here, the nucleus-associated immune pathways in blast-resistant rice genotype are elucidated. Temporal analysis of nuclear proteome is carried out using 2-DE coupled MS/MS analysis. A total of 140 immune responsive proteins are identified associated with nuclear reorganization, cell division, energy production/deprivation, signaling, and gene regulation. The proteome data are interrogated using correlation network analysis that identified significant functional modules pointing toward immune-related coinciding processes through a common mechanism of remodeling and homeostasis. Novel clues regarding blast resistance include nucleus-associated redox homeostasis and glycolytic enzyme-mediated chromatin organization which manipulates cell division and immunity. Taken together, the study herein provides evidence that the coordination of nuclear function and reprogramming of host translational machinery regulate resistance mechanism against blast disease.",modulation plant immune system extrinsicintrinsic factor hostspecific determinant finetunes cellular component involving multiple organelle particularly nucleus mount resistance pathogen attack rice blast caused hemibiotrophic fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating disease adversely affect rice productivity however role nuclear protein regulation response oryzae remains unknown nucleusassociated immune pathway blastresistant rice genotype elucidated temporal analysis nuclear proteome carried using de coupled msms analysis total immune responsive protein identified associated nuclear reorganization cell division energy productiondeprivation signaling gene regulation proteome data interrogated using correlation network analysis identified significant functional module pointing toward immunerelated coinciding process common mechanism remodeling homeostasis novel clue regarding blast resistance include nucleusassociated redox homeostasis glycolytic enzymemediated chromatin organization manipulates cell division immunity taken together study herein provides evidence coordination nuclear function reprogramming host translational machinery regulate resistance mechanism blast disease,1,"{'Disease': ['hemibiotrophic fungus', 'one devastating disease', 'host translational machinery regulate resistance mechanism blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10
26530637,Cloning of novel rice blast resistance genes from two rapidly evolving NBS-LRR gene families in rice.,"Most rice blast resistance genes (R-genes) encode proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Our previous study has shown that more rice blast R-genes can be cloned in rapidly evolving NBS-LRR gene families. In the present study, two rapidly evolving R-gene families in rice were selected for cloning a subset of genes from their paralogs in three resistant rice lines. A total of eight functional blast R-genes were identified among nine NBS-LRR genes, and some of these showed resistance to three or more blast strains. Evolutionary analysis indicated that high nucleotide diversity of coding regions served as important parameters in the determination of gene resistance. We also observed that amino-acid variants (nonsynonymous mutations, insertions, or deletions) in essential motifs of the NBS domain contribute to the blast resistance capacity of NBS-LRR genes. These results suggested that the NBS regions might also play an important role in resistance specificity determination. On the other hand, different splicing patterns of introns were commonly observed in R-genes. The results of the present study contribute to improving the effectiveness of R-gene identification by using evolutionary analysis method and acquisition of novel blast resistance genes.",rice blast resistance gene rgenes encode protein nucleotidebinding site nb leucinerich repeat lrr domain previous study shown rice blast rgenes cloned rapidly evolving nbslrr gene family present study two rapidly evolving rgene family rice selected cloning subset gene paralogs three resistant rice line total eight functional blast rgenes identified among nine nbslrr gene showed resistance three blast strain evolutionary analysis indicated high nucleotide diversity coding region served important parameter determination gene resistance also observed aminoacid variant nonsynonymous mutation insertion deletion essential motif nb domain contribute blast resistance capacity nbslrr gene result suggested nb region might also play important role resistance specificity determination hand different splicing pattern intron commonly observed rgenes result present study contribute improving effectiveness rgene identification using evolutionary analysis method acquisition novel blast resistance gene,10,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['evolutionary analysis method acquisition novel blast resistance gene'], 'Symptom': ['present study contribute improving effectiveness rgene identification']}",5
24841958,Phenotypic screening and molecular analysis of blast resistance in fragrant rice for marker assisted selection.,"Experiments were conducted to identify blast-resistant fragrant genotypes for the development of a durable blast-resistant rice variety during years 2012-2013. The results indicate that out of 140 test materials including 114 fragrant germplasms, 25 differential varieties (DVs) harbouring 23 blast-resistant genes, only 16 fragrant rice germplasms showed comparatively better performance against a virulent isolate of blast disease. The reaction pattern of single-spore isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae to differential varieties showed that Pish, Pi9, Pita-2 and Pita are the effective blast-resistant genes against the tested blast isolates in Bangladesh. The DNA markers profiles of selected 16 rice germplasms indicated that genotype Chinigura contained Pish, Pi9 and Pita genes; on the other hand, both BRRI dhan50 and Bawaibhog contained Pish and Pita genes in their genetic background. Genotypes Jirakatari, BR5, and Gopalbhog possessed Pish gene, while Uknimodhu, Deshikatari, Radhunipagol, Kalijira (3), Chinikanai each contained the Pita gene only.

37733784,Methionine biosynthesis enzyme MoMet2 is required for rice blast fungus pathogenicity by promoting virulence gene expression via reducing 5mC modification.,"The emergence of fungicide resistance severely threatens crop production by limiting the availability and application of established fungicides. Therefore, it is urgent to identify new fungicidal targets for controlling plant diseases. Here, we characterized the function of a conserved homoserine O-acetyltransferase (HOA) from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that could serve as the candidate antifungal target. Deletion of the MoMET2 and MoCYS2 genes encoding HOAs perturbed the biosynthesis of methionine and S-adenyl methionine, a methyl group donor for epigenetic modifications, and severely attenuated the development and virulence of M. oryzae. The ∆Momet2 mutant is significantly increased in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) modification that represses the expression of genes required for pathogenicity, including MoGLIK and MoCDH-CYT. We further showed that host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) targeting MoMET2 and MoCYS2 effectively controls rice blasts.

In the early stage of this study, a strain of Bacillus velezensis with strong inhibition of M. oryzae was isolated and named ZW10. In vitro assays indicated prolonged germination time of conidia of M. oryzae treated with the antifungal substances of ZW10, 78% of the conidia could not form appressorium, and the conidial tubes expanded to form vacuolar structure and then shrank. The results of FDA-PI composite dyes showed that the antifungal substances of ZW10 inhibited the normal activity of M. oryzae hyphae that were rarely able to infect the epidermal cells of rice leaf sheath in vivo tests. In addition, rice treated with the antifungal substances of ZW10 showed a variety of defense responses, including activation of defense-related enzymes, increased expression of the salicylic acid pathway genes, and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which might function directly or indirectly in resistance to pathogen attack. The field experiment with rice blast infection in different periods showed that the antifungal substances of ZW10 had the same control effect as carbendazim. The significant biological control activity of ZW10 and its capacity to stimulate host defenses suggest that this B. velezensis strain has the potential to be developed into a biopesticide for the biocontrol of rice blast.",rice blast caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae one three major disease affecting rice production quality reduces rice grain yield nearly early stage study strain bacillus velezensis strong inhibition oryzae isolated named zw vitro assay indicated prolonged germination time conidium oryzae treated antifungal substance zw conidium could form appressorium conidial tube expanded form vacuolar structure shrank result fdapi composite dye showed antifungal substance zw inhibited normal activity oryzae hypha rarely able infect epidermal cell rice leaf sheath vivo test addition rice treated antifungal substance zw showed variety defense response including activation defenserelated enzyme increased expression salicylic acid pathway gene accumulation hydrogen peroxide ho might function directly indirectly resistance pathogen attack field experiment rice blast infection different period showed antifungal substance zw control effect carbendazim significant biological control activity zw capacity stimulate host defense suggest b velezensis strain potential developed biopesticide biocontrol rice blast,4,"{'Disease': ['fungus magnaporthe', 'one three major disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['antifungal substance zw control effect carbendazim significant biological control activity']}",11
10755311,Identification of rice blast fungal elicitor-responsive genes by differential display analysis.,"In order to study molecular interactions that occur between rice and rice blast fungus upon infection, we isolated fungal elicitor-responsive genes from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Milyang 117) suspension-cultured cells treated with fungal elicitor prepared from the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) employing a method that combined mRNA differential display and cDNA library screening. Data base searches with the isolated cDNA clones revealed that the OsERG1 and OsERG2 cDNAs share significant similarities with the mammalian Ca2+-dependent lipid binding (C2) domains. The OsCPX1 cDNA is highly homologous to peroxidases. The OsHin1 cDNA exhibits homology to the tobacco hin1 gene, whose expression is induced by avirulent pathogens. The OsLPL1 and OsMEK1 cDNAs share homologies with lysophospholipases and serine/threonine mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinases, respectively. The OsWRKY1 and OsEREBP1 cDNAs are homologous to transcription factors, such as the WRKY protein family and the AP2/EREBP family, respectively. Transcripts of the OsERG1, OsHin1, and OsMEK1 genes were specifically elevated only in response to the avirulent race KJ301 of the rice blast fungus.

35627276,The <i>Pid</i> Family Has Been Diverged into <i>Xian</i> and <i>Geng</i> Type Resistance Genes against Rice Blast Disease.,"Rice blast (the causative agent the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) represents a major constraint on the productivity of one of the world's most important staple food crops. Genes encoding resistance have been identified in both the <i>Xian</i> and <i>Geng</i> subspecies genepools, and combining these within new cultivars represents a rational means of combating the pathogen. In this research, deeper allele mining was carried out on <i>Pid2</i>, <i>Pid3</i>, and <i>Pid4</i> via each comprehensive FNP marker set in three panels consisting of 70 <i>Xian</i> and 58 <i>Geng</i> cultivars. Within <i>Pid2</i>, three functional and one non-functional alleles were identified; the former were only identified in <i>Xian</i> type entries. At <i>Pid3</i>, four functional and one non-functional alleles were identified; once again, all of the former were present in <i>Xian</i> type entries. However, the pattern of variation at <i>Pid4</i> was rather different: here, the five functional alleles uncovered were dispersed across the <i>Geng</i> type germplasm. Among all the twelve candidate functional alleles, both <i>Pid2</i>-ZS and <i>Pid3</i>-ZS were predominant. Furthermore, the resistance functions of both <i>Pid2</i>-ZS and <i>Pid3</i>-ZS were assured by transformation test. Profiting from the merits of three comprehensive FNP marker sets, the study has validated all three members of the <i>Pid</i> family as having been strictly diverged into <i>Xian</i> and <i>Geng</i> subspecies: <i>Pid2</i> and <i>Pid3</i> were defined as <i>Xian</i> type resistance genes, and <i>Pid4</i> as <i>Geng</i> type.

The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) immune receptor pairs Pik-1/Pik-2 and RGA5/RGA4 both use integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domains to bind the effectors AVR-Pik and AVR-Pia, respectively, from the rice blast fungal pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> These effectors both belong to the MAX effector family and share a core structural fold, despite being divergent in sequence. How integrated domains in NLRs maintain specificity of effector recognition, even of structurally similar effectors, has implications for understanding plant immune receptor evolution and function.

30390130,Pid3-I1 is a race-specific partial-resistance allele at the Pid3 blast resistance locus in rice.,"The rice blast resistance QTL detected on chromosome 6 in MC276 is Pid3-I1, one of the multiple alleles at the Pid3 locus. Pid3-I1 shows race-specific partial resistance. Many of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for rice blast resistance reported to date remain unidentified. In the present study, we focused on qBRM6.2, a known blast-resistance QTL in experimental resistant rice line MC276. A CO39 near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying qBRM6.2 from MC276 was developed here, and we showed that qBRM6.2 resistance was partial but race specific to Japanese blast isolates using the NIL. Because defense genes in the NIL were expressed sooner than those in CO39 after inoculation with a blast isolate, qBRM6.2 resistance appeared to be an induced resistance. Next, we demonstrated that qBRM6.2 was located within a 123-kb interval on chromosome 6. Among the six genes annotated in the interval, only four genes appeared to be functional. Among these four, a polymorphism between CO39 and the NIL for qBRM6.2 at the amino acid sequence level was detected only in Os06g0330400 that encodes a fatty acid hydroxylase domain-containing protein and in Os06g0330100, the blast resistance locus Pid3, that encodes a nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein. Moreover, the allele at the Pid3 locus in the NIL was Pid3-I1, originally identified as a complete blast resistance gene in Kasalath. To clarify whether Pid3-I1 is qBRM6.2, we investigated the resistance phenotype of Pid3-I1 to Japanese isolates using Nipponbare transgenic lines that express Pid3-I1. The results showed that Pid3-I1 was a race-specific but partial-resistance allele at the Pid3 locus, suggesting strongly that Pid3-I1 is qBRM6.2. The discrepancy in the phenotype of Pid3-I1 between the present and previous reports is also discussed.",rice blast resistance qtl detected chromosome mc pidi one multiple allele pid locus pidi show racespecific partial resistance many quantitative trait locus qtls rice blast resistance reported date remain unidentified present study focused qbrm known blastresistance qtl experimental resistant rice line mc co nearisogenic line nil carrying qbrm mc developed showed qbrm resistance partial race specific japanese blast isolates using nil defense gene nil expressed sooner co inoculation blast isolate qbrm resistance appeared induced resistance next demonstrated qbrm located within kb interval chromosome among six gene annotated interval four gene appeared functional among four polymorphism co nil qbrm amino acid sequence level detected osg encodes fatty acid hydroxylase domaincontaining protein osg blast resistance locus pid encodes nucleotidebinding siteleucinerich repeat protein moreover allele pid locus nil pidi originally identified complete blast resistance gene kasalath clarify whether pidi qbrm investigated resistance phenotype pidi japanese isolates using nipponbare transgenic line express pidi result showed pidi racespecific partialresistance allele pid locus suggesting strongly pidi qbrm discrepancy phenotype pidi present previous report also discussed,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13
17601827,Rice WRKY45 plays a crucial role in benzothiadiazole-inducible blast resistance.,"Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a so-called plant activator and protects plants from diseases by activating the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway. By microarray screening, we identified BTH- and SA-inducible WRKY transcription factor (TF) genes that were upregulated within 3 h after BTH treatment. Overexpression of one of them, WRKY45, in rice (Oryza sativa) markedly enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of WRKY45 compromised BTH-inducible resistance to blast disease, indicating that it is essential for BTH-induced defense responses. In a transient expression system, WRKY45 activated reporter gene transcription through W-boxes. Epistasis analysis suggested that WRKY45 acts in the SA signaling pathway independently of NH1, a rice ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1, which distinguishes WRKY45 from known Arabidopsis WRKY TFs. Two defense-related genes, encoding a glutathione S-transferase and a cytochrome P450, were found to be regulated downstream of WRKY45 but were not regulated by NH1, consistent with the apparent independence of the WRKY45- and NH1-dependent pathways. Defense gene expression in WRKY45-overexpressed rice plants varied with growth conditions, suggesting that some environmental factor(s) acts downstream of WRKY45 transcription. We propose a role for WRKY45 in BTH-induced and SA-mediated defense signaling in rice and its potential utility in improving disease resistance of rice, an importance food resource worldwide.",benzothiadiazole bth socalled plant activator protects plant disease activating salicylic acid sa signaling pathway microarray screening identified bth sainducible wrky transcription factor tf gene upregulated within h bth treatment overexpression one wrky rice oryza sativa markedly enhanced resistance rice blast fungus rna interferencemediated knockdown wrky compromised bthinducible resistance blast disease indicating essential bthinduced defense response transient expression system wrky activated reporter gene transcription wboxes epistasis analysis suggested wrky act sa signaling pathway independently nh rice ortholog arabidopsis thaliana npr distinguishes wrky known arabidopsis wrky tfs two defenserelated gene encoding glutathione stransferase cytochrome p found regulated downstream wrky regulated nh consistent apparent independence wrky nhdependent pathway defense gene expression wrkyoverexpressed rice plant varied growth condition suggesting environmental factor act downstream wrky transcription propose role wrky bthinduced samediated defense signaling rice potential utility improving disease resistance rice importance food resource worldwide,12,"{'Disease': ['plant disease', 'markedly enhanced resistance rice blast fungus rna', 'knockdown wrky compromised bthinducible resistance blast disease', 'disease resistance rice importance food resource'], 'Treatment': ['h bth treatment overexpression'], 'Symptom': []}",7

Plant intracellular immune receptors (NLRs) often occur as allelic series with differential pathogen specificities. The determinants of this specificity remain largely unknown. Here, we unravelled the biophysical and structural basis of expanded specificity in the allelic rice NLR Pik, which responds to the effector AVR-Pik from the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Rice plants expressing the Pikm allele resist infection by blast strains expressing any of three AVR-Pik effector variants, whereas those expressing Pikp only respond to one. Unlike Pikp, the integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain of Pikm binds with high affinity to each of the three recognized effector variants, and variation at binding interfaces between effectors and Pikp-HMA or Pikm-HMA domains encodes specificity. By understanding how co-evolution has shaped the response profile of an allelic NLR, we highlight how natural selection drove the emergence of new receptor specificities.

26141566,Genetic analysis of durable resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in the rice accession Gigante Vercelli identified two blast resistance loci.,"Rice cultivars exhibiting durable resistance to blast, the most important rice fungal disease provoking up to 30 % of rice losses, are very rare and searching for sources of such a resistance represents a priority for rice-breeding programs. To this aim we analyzed Gigante Vercelli (GV) and Vialone Nano (VN), two temperate japonica rice cultivars in Italy displaying contrasting response to blast, with GV showing a durable and broad-spectrum resistance, whereas VN being highly susceptible. An SSR-based genetic map developed using a GV × VN population segregating for blast resistance identified two blast resistance loci, localized to the long arm of chromosomes 1 and 4 explaining more than 78 % of the observed phenotypic variation for blast resistance. The pyramiding of two blast resistance QTLs was therefore involved in the observed durable resistance in GV. Mapping data were integrated with information obtained from RNA-seq expression profiling of all classes of resistance protein genes (resistance gene analogs, RGAs) and with the map position of known cloned or mapped blast resistance genes to search candidates for the GV resistant response. A co-localization of RGAs with the LOD peak or the marker interval of the chromosome 1 QTL was highlighted and a valuable tool for selecting the resistance gene during breeding programs was developed. Comparative analysis with known blast resistance genes revealed co-positional relationships between the chromosome 1 QTL with the Pi35/Pish blast resistance alleles and showed that the chromosome 4 QTL represents a newly identified blast resistance gene. The present genetic analysis has therefore allowed the identification of two blast resistance loci in the durable blast-resistant rice cultivar GV and tools for molecular selection of these resistance genes.",rice cultivar exhibiting durable resistance blast important rice fungal disease provoking rice loss rare searching source resistance represents priority ricebreeding program aim analyzed gigante vercelli gv vialone nano vn two temperate japonica rice cultivar italy displaying contrasting response blast gv showing durable broadspectrum resistance whereas vn highly susceptible ssrbased genetic map developed using gv × vn population segregating blast resistance identified two blast resistance locus localized long arm chromosome explaining observed phenotypic variation blast resistance pyramiding two blast resistance qtls therefore involved observed durable resistance gv mapping data integrated information obtained rnaseq expression profiling class resistance protein gene resistance gene analog rgas map position known cloned mapped blast resistance gene search candidate gv resistant response colocalization rgas lod peak marker interval chromosome qtl highlighted valuable tool selecting resistance gene breeding program developed comparative analysis known blast resistance gene revealed copositional relationship chromosome qtl pipish blast resistance allele showed chromosome qtl represents newly identified blast resistance gene present genetic analysis therefore allowed identification two blast resistance locus durable blastresistant rice cultivar gv tool molecular selection resistance gene,2,"{'Disease': ['durable resistance blast important rice fungal disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

In this study, a new blast-resistant gene, OsBRW1, was screened from a set of rice near-isogenic lines (NILs) with different blast-resistant ability. Under the infection of Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae), OsBRW1 in the resistant NIL Pi-4b was highly induced than that in the susceptible NIL Pi-1 and their parent line CO39, and the blast-resistant ability of OsBRW1 was further confirmed by using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and over-expression methods. The protein encoded by OsBRW1 was a typical NBS-LRR with NB-ARC domain and localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and the transient expression of OsBRW1 was capable of triggering hypersensitive response in tobacco leaves. Protein interaction experiments showed that OsBRW1 protein directly interacted with OsSRFP1. At the early infection stage of M. oryzae, OsBRW1 gene induced OsSRFP1 to highly expression level and accumulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, up-regulated the defence responsive signalling transduction genes and the pathogenesis-related genes and increased JA and SA content in the resistant NIL Pi-4b. By contrary, lower content of endogenous JA and SA in osbrw1 mutants was found at the same stage.

18622033,Molecular evolution of the Pi-ta gene resistant to rice blast in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon).,"Rice blast disease resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea is triggered by a physical interaction between the protein products of the host R (resistance) gene, Pi-ta, and the pathogen Avr (avirulence) gene, AVR-pita. The genotype variation and resistant/susceptible phenotype at the Pi-ta locus of wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), the ancestor of cultivated rice (O. sativa), was surveyed in 36 locations worldwide to study the molecular evolution and functional adaptation of the Pi-ta gene. The low nucleotide polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene of O. rufipogon was similar to that of O. sativa, but greatly differed from what has been reported for other O. rufipogon genes. The haplotypes can be subdivided into two divergent haplogroups named H1 and H2. H1 is derived from H2, with nearly no variation and at a low frequency. H2 is common and is the ancestral form. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain has a high pi(non)/pi(syn) ratio, and the low polymorphism of the Pi-ta gene might have primarily been caused by recurrent selective sweep and constraint by other putative physiological functions. Meanwhile, we provide data to show that the amino acid Ala-918 of H1 in the LRR domain has a close relationship with the resistant phenotype.

28755027,Genetic Structure of the Rice Blast Pathogen (Magnaporthe oryzae) over a Decade in North Central California Rice Fields.,"Rice blast, caused by the ascomycete Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive rice diseases worldwide. Even though the disease has been present in California since 1996, there is no data for the pathogen population biology in the state. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms and mating-type markers, the M. oryzae population diversity was investigated using isolates collected when the disease was first established in California and isolates collected a decade later. While in the 1990 samples, a single multilocus genotype (MLG) was identified (MLG1), over a decade later, we found 14 additional MLGs in the 2000 isolates. Some of these MLGs were found to infect the only rice blast-resistant cultivar (M-208) available for commercial production in California. The same samples also had a significant decrease of MLG1. MLG1 was found infecting the resistant rice cultivar M-208 on one occasion whereas MLG7 was the most common genotype infecting the M-208. MLG7 was identified in the 2000 samples, and it was not present in the M. oryzae population a decade earlier. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in genotypic diversity over time with no evidence of sexual reproduction and suggest a recent introduction of new virulent race(s) of the pathogen. In addition, our data could provide information regarding the durability of the Pi-z resistance gene of the M-208.

30367631,OsWRKY67 positively regulates blast and bacteria blight resistance by direct activation of PR genes in rice.,"WRKY proteins are one of the largest gene families and are well-known for their regulatory roles in many aspects of plant development, including plant response to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Although the roles of WRKY proteins in leaf blast resistance have been well-documented in rice, their functions in panicle blast, the most destructive type of blast disease, are still largely unknown. Here, we identified that the transcription of OsWRKY67 was strongly activated by leaf and panicle blast infection. OsWRKY67 is ubiquitously expressed and sub-localized in the nucleus. Rice plants overexpressing OsWRKY67 showed quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight. In contrast, silencing of OsWRKY67 increased the susceptibility to blast and bacterial blight diseases. RNA-seq analysis indicated that OsWRKY67 induces the transcription of a set of defense-related genes including the ones involved in the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent pathway. Consistent with this, the OsWRKY67-overexpressing plants accumulated higher amounts of endogenous SA, whereas lower endogenous SA levels were observed in OsWRKY67-silenced plants relative to wild-type Nipponbare plants before and after pathogen attack. Moreover, we also observed that OsWRKY67 directly binds to the promoters of PR1a and PR10 to activate their expression. These results together suggest the positive role of OsWRKY67 in regulating rice responses to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight disease.

37256700,"Engineering Climate-Resilient Rice Using a Nanobiostimulant-Based ""Stress Training"" Strategy.","Under a changing climate, cultivating climate-resilient crops will be critical to maintaining food security. Here, we propose the application of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating nanoparticles as nanobiostimulants to trigger stress/immune responses and subsequently increase the stress resilience of plants. We established three regimens of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-based ""stress training"": seed training (ST), leaf training (LT), and combined seed and leaf training (SLT). Trained rice seedlings were then exposed to either rice blast fungus (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) or chilling stress (10 °C). The results show that all ""stress training"" regimes, particularly SLT, significantly enhanced the resistance of rice against the fungal pathogen (lesion size reduced by 82% relative to untrained control). SLT also significantly enhanced rice tolerance to cold stress. The mechanisms for the enhanced resilience were investigated with metabolomics and transcriptomics, which show that ""stress training"" induced considerable metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming in rice leaves. AgNPs boosted ROS-activated stress signaling pathways by oxidative post-translational modifications of stress-related kinases, hormones, and transcriptional factors (TFs). These signaling pathways subsequently modulated the expression of defense genes, including specialized metabolites (SMs) biosynthesis genes, cell membrane lipid metabolism genes, and pathogen-plant interaction genes. Importantly, results showed that the ""stress memory"" can be transferred transgenerationally, conferring offspring seeds with improved seed germination and seedling vigor. This may provide an epigenetic breeding strategy to fortify stress resilience of crops.

26248689,A genome-wide survey reveals abundant rice blast R genes in resistant cultivars.,"Plant resistance genes (R genes) harbor tremendous allelic diversity, constituting a robust immune system effective against microbial pathogens. Nevertheless, few functional R genes have been identified for even the best-studied pathosystems. Does this limited repertoire reflect specificity, with most R genes having been defeated by former pests, or do plants harbor a rich diversity of functional R genes, the composite behavior of which is yet to be characterized? Here, we survey 332 NBS-LRR genes cloned from five resistant Oryza sativa (rice) cultivars for their ability to confer recognition of 12 rice blast isolates when transformed into susceptible cultivars. Our survey reveals that 48.5% of the 132 NBS-LRR loci tested contain functional rice blast R genes, with most R genes deriving from multi-copy clades containing especially diversified loci. Each R gene recognized, on average, 2.42 of the 12 isolates screened. The abundant R genes identified in resistant genomes provide extraordinary redundancy in the ability of host genotypes to recognize particular isolates. If the same is true for other pathogens, many extant NBS-LRR genes retain functionality.

The possible role of OsSBP in plant defense was evaluated by using a transgenic approach. Plants overexpressing OsSBP showed enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of rice blast fungus as well as to rice bacterial blight. The expression of defense-related genes and the accumulation of phytoalexin after infection by rice blast fungus were accelerated in the OsSBP overexpressors. A higher level of H(2)O(2) accumulation and reduced activity of such scavenging enzymes as ascorbate peroxidase and catalase were seen when the OsSBP-overexpressing plants were treated with the protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor, calyculin A. These results suggest that the upregulation of OsSBP expression conferred enhanced tolerance to different pathogens, possibly by increasing plant sensitivity to endogenous defense responses.

Japonica), a glutinous local rice variety from Guizhou Province, People's Republic of China. Transgenic lines were identified by ß-glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical staining, PCR, and Southern blot analyses. Agronomic traits, resistance to rice blast and herbicide, chitinase activities, and transcript levels of McCHIT1 were assessed in the T2 progeny of three transgenic lines (L1, L8, and L10). The results showed that the introduction of McCHIT1-PAT into Lailong significantly enhanced herbicide and blast resistance. After infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, all of the T2 progeny exhibited less severe lesion symptoms than those of wild type. The disease indices were 100% for wild type, 65.66% for T2 transgenic line L1, 59.69% for T2 transgenic line L8, and 79.80% for T2 transgenic line L10.

38825969,Proteomic signatures uncover phenotypic plasticity of susceptible and resistant genotypes by wall remodelers in rice blast.,"Molecular communication between macromolecules dictates extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics during pathogen recognition and disease development. Extensive research has shed light on how plant immune components are activated, regulated and function in response to pathogen attack. However, two key questions remain largely unresolved: (i) how does ECM dynamics govern susceptibility and disease resistance, (ii) what are the components that underpin these phenomena? Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae adversely affects rice productivity. To understand ECM regulated genotype-phenotype plasticity in blast disease, we temporally profiled two contrasting rice genotypes in disease and immune state. Morpho-histological, biochemical and electron microscopy analyses revealed that increased necrotic lesions accompanied by electrolyte leakage governs disease state. Wall carbohydrate quantification showed changes in pectin level was more significant in blast susceptible compared to blast resistant cultivar. Temporally resolved quantitative disease- and immune-responsive ECM proteomes identified 308 and 334 proteins, respectively involved in wall remodelling and integrity, signalling and disease/immune response. Pairwise comparisons between time and treatment, messenger ribonucleic acid expression, diseasome and immunome networks revealed novel blast-related functional modules.

The utilization of host resistance (R) genes is considered to be the most effective and economic means to control rice blast. Here, we show that the japonica landrace Yangmaogu (YMG) displays a broader spectrum of resistance to blast isolates than other previously reported broad-spectrum resistant (BSR) cultivars. Genetic analysis suggested that YMG contains at least three major R genes. One gene, Pi64, which exhibits resistance to indica-sourced isolate CH43 and several other isolates, was mapped to a 43-kb interval on chromosome 1 of YMG. Two open reading frames (NBS-1 and NBS-2) encoding nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins were short-listed as candidate genes for Pi64. Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into three susceptible japonica cultivars. Only transformants with NBS-2 conferred resistance to leaf and neck blast, validating the idea that NBS-2 represents the functional Pi64 gene. Pi64 is constitutively expressed at all development stages and in all tissues examined. Pi64 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae pose major threat rice production worldwide utilization host resistance r gene considered effective economic mean control rice blast show japonica landrace yangmaogu ymg display broader spectrum resistance blast isolates previously reported broadspectrum resistant bsr cultivar genetic analysis suggested ymg contains least three major r gene one gene pi exhibit resistance indicasourced isolate ch several isolates mapped kb interval chromosome ymg two open reading frame nb nb encoding nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat protein shortlisted candidate gene pi construct containing candidate gene transformed three susceptible japonica cultivar transformants nb conferred resistance leaf neck blast validating idea nb represents functional pi gene pi constitutively expressed development stage tissue examined pi protein localized cytoplasm nucleus furthermore introgression pi susceptible cultivar via gene transformation markerassisted selection conferred highlevel broadspectrum leaf neck blast resistance indicasourced isolates demonstrating potential utility breeding bsr rice cultivar,10,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
39146939,Extensive immune receptor repertoire diversity in disease-resistant rice landraces.,"Plants have powerful defense mechanisms and extensive immune receptor repertoires, yet crop monocultures are prone to epidemic diseases. Rice (Oryza sativa) is susceptible to many diseases, such as rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Varietal resistance of rice to blast relies on intracellular nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that recognize specific pathogen molecules and trigger immune responses. In the Yuanyang terraces in southwest China, rice landraces rarely show severe losses to disease whereas commercial inbred lines show pronounced field susceptibility. Here, we investigate within-landrace NLR sequence diversity of nine rice landraces and eleven modern varieties using complexity reduction techniques. We find that NLRs display high sequence diversity in landraces, consistent with balancing selection, and that balancing selection at NLRs is more pervasive in landraces than modern varieties. Notably, modern varieties lack many ancient NLR haplotypes that are retained in some landraces. Our study emphasizes the value of standing genetic variation that is maintained in farmer landraces as a resource to make modern crops and agroecosystems less prone to disease. The conservation of landraces is, therefore, crucial for ensuring food security in the face of dynamic biotic and abiotic threats.",plant powerful defense mechanism extensive immune receptor repertoire yet crop monoculture prone epidemic disease rice oryza sativa susceptible many disease rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae varietal resistance rice blast relies intracellular nucleotide binding leucinerich repeat nlr receptor recognize specific pathogen molecule trigger immune response yuanyang terrace southwest china rice landraces rarely show severe loss disease whereas commercial inbred line show pronounced field susceptibility investigate withinlandrace nlr sequence diversity nine rice landraces eleven modern variety using complexity reduction technique find nlrs display high sequence diversity landraces consistent balancing selection balancing selection nlrs pervasive landraces modern variety notably modern variety lack many ancient nlr haplotype retained landraces study emphasizes value standing genetic variation maintained farmer landraces resource make modern crop agroecosystems less prone disease conservation landraces therefore crucial ensuring food security face dynamic biotic abiotic threat,1,"{'Disease': ['monoculture prone epidemic disease rice oryza sativa', 'many disease rice blast', 'severe loss disease', 'less prone disease conservation landraces'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
16404154,Characterization of rice mutants with enhanced susceptibility to rice blast.,"As a first step towards identifying genes involving in the signal transduction pathways mediating rice blast resistance, we isolated 3 mutants lines that showed enhanced susceptibility to rice blast KJ105 (91-033) from a T-DNA insertion library of the japonica rice cultivar, Hwayeong. Since none of the susceptible phenotypes co-segregated with the T-DNA insertion we adapted a map-based cloning strategy to isolate the gene(s) responsible for the enhanced susceptibility of the Hwayeong mutants. A genetic mapping population was produced by crossing the resistant wild type Hwayeong with the susceptible cultivar, Nagdong. Chi-square analysis of the F2 segregating population indicated that resistance in Hwayeong was controlled by a single major gene that we tentatively named Pi-hy. Randomly selected susceptible plants in the F2 population were used to build an initial map of Pi-hy. The SSLP marker RM2265 on chromosome 2 was closely linked to resistance. High resolution mapping using 105 F2 plants revealed that the resistance gene was tightly linked, or identical, to Pib, a resistance gene with a nucleotide binding sequence and leucine-rich repeats (NB-LRR) previously isolated. Sequence analysis of the Pib locus amplified from three susceptible mutants revealed lesions within this gene, demonstrating that the Pi-hy gene is Pib. The Pib mutations in 1D-22-10-13, 1D-54-16-8, and 1C-143-16-1 were, respectively, a missense mutation in the conserved NB domain 3, a nonsense mutation in the 5th LRR, and a nonsense mutation in the C terminus following the LRRs that causes a small deletion of the C terminus. These findings provide evidence that NB domain 3 and the C terminus are required for full activity of the plant R gene. They also suggest that alterations of the resistance gene can cause major differences in pathogen specificity by affecting interactions with an avirulence factor.",first step towards identifying gene involving signal transduction pathway mediating rice blast resistance isolated mutant line showed enhanced susceptibility rice blast kj tdna insertion library japonica rice cultivar hwayeong since none susceptible phenotype cosegregated tdna insertion adapted mapbased cloning strategy isolate gene responsible enhanced susceptibility hwayeong mutant genetic mapping population produced crossing resistant wild type hwayeong susceptible cultivar nagdong chisquare analysis f segregating population indicated resistance hwayeong controlled single major gene tentatively named pihy randomly selected susceptible plant f population used build initial map pihy sslp marker rm chromosome closely linked resistance high resolution mapping using f plant revealed resistance gene tightly linked identical pib resistance gene nucleotide binding sequence leucinerich repeat nblrr previously isolated sequence analysis pib locus amplified three susceptible mutant revealed lesion within gene demonstrating pihy gene pib pib mutation c respectively missense mutation conserved nb domain nonsense mutation th lrr nonsense mutation c terminus following lrrs cause small deletion c terminus finding provide evidence nb domain c terminus required full activity plant r gene also suggest alteration resistance gene cause major difference pathogen specificity affecting interaction avirulence factor,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
37154202,Identification of two novel rice S genes through combination of association and transcription analyses with gene-editing technology.,"Traditional rice blast resistance breeding largely depends on utilizing typical resistance (R) genes. However, the lack of durable R genes has prompted rice breeders to find new resistance resources. Susceptibility (S) genes are potential new targets for resistance genetic engineering using genome-editing technologies, but identifying them is still challenging. Here, through the integration of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptional analysis, we identified two genes, RNG1 and RNG3, whose polymorphisms in 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) affected their expression variations. These polymorphisms could serve as molecular markers to identify rice blast-resistant accessions. Editing the 3'-UTRs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology affected the expression levels of two genes, which were positively associated with rice blast susceptibility. Knocking out either RNG1 or RNG3 in rice enhanced the rice blast and bacterial blight resistance, without impacting critical agronomic traits. RNG1 and RNG3 have two major genotypes in diverse rice germplasms. The frequency of the resistance genotype of these two genes significantly increased from landrace rice to modern cultivars. The obvious selective sweep flanking RNG3 suggested it has been artificially selected in modern rice breeding.

25198435,Toward understanding of rice innate immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, causes serious disease on a wide variety of grasses including rice, wheat and barley. The recognition of pathogens is an amazing ability of plants including strategies for displacing virulence effectors through the adaption of both conserved and variable pathogen elicitors. The pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) were reported as two main innate immune responses in plants, where PTI gives basal resistance and ETI confers durable resistance. The PTI consists of extracellular surface receptors that are able to recognize PAMPs. PAMPs detect microbial features such as fungal chitin that complete a vital function during the organism's life. In contrast, ETI is mediated by intracellular receptor molecules containing nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains that specifically recognize effector proteins produced by the pathogen. To enhance crop resistance, understanding the host resistance mechanisms against pathogen infection strategies and having a deeper knowledge of innate immunity system are essential. This review summarizes the recent advances on the molecular mechanism of innate immunity systems of rice against M. oryzae. The discussion will be centered on the latest success reported in plant-pathogen interactions and integrated defense responses in rice.",blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae cause serious disease wide variety grass including rice wheat barley recognition pathogen amazing ability plant including strategy displacing virulence effector adaption conserved variable pathogen elicitors pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamptriggered immunity pti effectortriggered immunity eti reported two main innate immune response plant pti give basal resistance eti confers durable resistance pti consists extracellular surface receptor able recognize pamps pamps detect microbial feature fungal chitin complete vital function organism life contrast eti mediated intracellular receptor molecule containing nucleotidebinding nb leucine rich repeat lrr domain specifically recognize effector protein produced pathogen enhance crop resistance understanding host resistance mechanism pathogen infection strategy deeper knowledge innate immunity system essential review summarizes recent advance molecular mechanism innate immunity system rice oryzae discussion centered latest success reported plantpathogen interaction integrated defense response rice,1,"{'Disease': ['blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'serious disease wide variety grass'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['virulence effector adaption']}",7

39465494,"Active DNA Demethylation Mediated by <i>OsGADD45a2</i> Regulates Growth, Development, and Blast (<i>Magnaporthe oryzea</i>) Resistance in Rice.","OsGADD45a1, a member of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) family in rice, has a newly identified homologue, OsGADD45a2, which differs from OsGADD45a1 in only three amino acids. The role and function of the OsGADD45a2 in DNA demethylation are not well-understood and were investigated in this study. <i>Osgadd45a2</i> mutants exhibited reduced height, shorter panicle length, fewer grains per panicle, and a lower seed setting rate compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the results showed that <i>OsGADD45a2</i> negatively regulates rice blast fungus resistance and exhibited high expression in various tissues. Using the 3000 Rice Genomes Project database, we identified four major haplotypes (each with over 100 cultivars) based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding sequence of <i>OsGADD45a2</i>. Among these, Hap4 was associated with a significantly greater plant height than Hap1-3, possibly due to a functional alteration of <i>OsGADD45a2</i> linked to the SNP at position 2614993. In <i>OsGADD45a2</i> overexpression lines, significant decreases in CG and CHG methylation levels were observed in protein-coding genes, leading to their upregulation.

27525942,Population structure analysis and association mapping of blast resistance in indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) landraces.,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide. To understand the genetic diversity of indica landrace accessions and identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that are associated with blast resistance, a population of 276 indica landraces from across the world was constructed. This population was then used to evaluate the blast-resistance phenotype through artificial inoculation under controlled conditions in 2012 and 2013. The genetic diversity and association of the population with resistance were analyzed by examining the phenotype for 160 SSR markers distributed on 12 rice chromosomes. The 276 accessions were classified into seven groups using model- and distance-based cluster analyses. Associations between SSR markers and blast resistance showed that 26 SSR markers were significantly associated with blast resistance in 2012 and 2013 (P < 0.01) and that the phenotypic variation ranged from 2.68 to 13.11%. Nineteen of the markers associated with blast resistance were located in regions where genes or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been previously reported, and seven were newly identified in this study. These results indicate that marker-trait association has potential advantages over classical linkage analysis and QTL mapping, and that these markers could be used for marker-assisted selection in rice blast-resistance-breeding programs.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae one devastating rice disease worldwide understand genetic diversity indica landrace accession identify simple sequence repeat ssr marker associated blast resistance population indica landraces across world constructed population used evaluate blastresistance phenotype artificial inoculation controlled condition genetic diversity association population resistance analyzed examining phenotype ssr marker distributed rice chromosome accession classified seven group using model distancebased cluster analysis association ssr marker blast resistance showed ssr marker significantly associated blast resistance p phenotypic variation ranged nineteen marker associated blast resistance located region gene quantitative trait locus qtls previously reported seven newly identified study result indicate markertrait association potential advantage classical linkage analysis qtl mapping marker could used markerassisted selection rice blastresistancebreeding program,2,"{'Disease': ['one devastating rice disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

Therefore, we carried out a transcriptome study on rice early defense response to M. oryzae. We found that the transcriptional profiles of rice compatible and incompatible interactions with M. oryzae were mostly similar, with genes regulated more prominently in the incompatible interactions. The functional analysis showed that the genes involved in signaling and secondary metabolism were extensively up-regulated. In particular, WRKY transcription factor genes were significantly enriched among the up-regulated genes. Overexpressing one of these WRKY genes, OsWRKY47, in transgenic rice plants conferred enhanced resistance against rice blast fungus.

The development of resistant cultivars is considered an efficient and sustainable approach to mitigate rice yield reduction. In the present study, we describe the development of japonica rice introgression lines with multiple resistance genes (MR lines), resistant to four different types of biotic stresses, and compare the agronomic performance, yield, and grain quality parameters of these lines with those of the recurrent parent. A total of nine MR lines were developed by marker-assisted backcrossing, which combined five single-R genes in a japonica background with a minimum of linkage drag. All the MR lines harbored the R genes Bph18 and qSTV11<sup>SG</sup> and two Pi genes (Pib + Pik) in common, offering resistance to brown planthopper (BPH), rice stripe virus (RSV), and rice blast disease, respectively. In the case of bacterial blight (BB), Xa40 was detected in only five out of the nine and Xa3 was validated in the others. In particular, the five MR lines pyramiding the R genes (Bph18 + qSTV11SG + Pib + Pik) in combination with Xa40 showed stable resistance to all bioassays for BPH, BB, blast, and RSV. The MR lines did not show any negative effects on the main agronomic traits, including yield production and rice grain quality.

31597961,A sensor kinase controls turgor-driven plant infection by the rice blast fungus.,"The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae gains entry to its host plant by means of a specialized pressure-generating infection cell called an appressorium, which physically ruptures the leaf cuticle<sup>1,2</sup>. Turgor is applied as an enormous invasive force by septin-mediated reorganization of the cytoskeleton and actin-dependent protrusion of a rigid penetration hypha<sup>3</sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the generation of turgor pressure during appressorium-mediated infection of plants remain poorly understood. Here we show that a turgor-sensing histidine-aspartate kinase, Sln1, enables the appressorium to sense when a critical turgor threshold has been reached and thereby facilitates host penetration. We found that the Sln1 sensor localizes to the appressorium pore in a pressure-dependent manner, which is consistent with the predictions of a mathematical model for plant infection. A Δsln1 mutant generates excess intracellular appressorium turgor, produces hyper-melanized non-functional appressoria and does not organize the septins and polarity determinants that are required for leaf infection. Sln1 acts in parallel with the protein kinase C cell-integrity pathway as a regulator of cAMP-dependent signalling by protein kinase A. Pkc1 phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase regulator NoxR and, collectively, these signalling pathways modulate appressorium turgor and trigger the generation of invasive force to cause blast disease.",blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae gain entry host plant mean specialized pressuregenerating infection cell called appressorium physically rupture leaf cuticlesupsup turgor applied enormous invasive force septinmediated reorganization cytoskeleton actindependent protrusion rigid penetration hyphasupsup however molecular mechanism regulate generation turgor pressure appressoriummediated infection plant remain poorly understood show turgorsensing histidineaspartate kinase sln enables appressorium sense critical turgor threshold reached thereby facilitates host penetration found sln sensor localizes appressorium pore pressuredependent manner consistent prediction mathematical model plant infection δsln mutant generates excess intracellular appressorium turgor produce hypermelanized nonfunctional appressoria organize septins polarity determinant required leaf infection sln act parallel protein kinase c cellintegrity pathway regulator campdependent signalling protein kinase pkc phosphorylates nadph oxidase regulator noxr collectively signalling pathway modulate appressorium turgor trigger generation invasive force cause blast disease,3,"{'Disease': ['blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
25659573,Comparative genomics identifies the Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence effector AvrPi9 that triggers Pi9-mediated blast resistance in rice.,"We identified the Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence effector AvrPi9 cognate to rice blast resistance gene Pi9 by comparative genomics of requisite strains derived from a sequential planting method. AvrPi9 encodes a small secreted protein that appears to localize in the biotrophic interfacial complex and is translocated to the host cell during rice infection. AvrPi9 forms a tandem gene array with its paralogue proximal to centromeric region of chromosome 7. AvrPi9 is expressed highly at early stages during initiation of blast disease. Virulent isolate strains contain Mg-SINE within the AvrPi9 coding sequence. Loss of AvrPi9 did not lead to any discernible defects during growth or pathogenesis in M. oryzae. This study reiterates the role of diverse transposable elements as off-switch agents in acquisition of gain-of-virulence in the rice blast fungus. The prevalence of AvrPi9 correlates well with the avirulence pathotype in diverse blast isolates from the Philippines and China, thus supporting the broad-spectrum resistance conferred by Pi9 in different rice growing areas. Our results revealed that Pi9 and Piz-t at the Pi2/9 locus activate race specific resistance by recognizing sequence-unrelated AvrPi9 and AvrPiz-t genes, respectively.",identified magnaporthe oryzae avirulence effector avrpi cognate rice blast resistance gene pi comparative genomics requisite strain derived sequential planting method avrpi encodes small secreted protein appears localize biotrophic interfacial complex translocated host cell rice infection avrpi form tandem gene array paralogue proximal centromeric region chromosome avrpi expressed highly early stage initiation blast disease virulent isolate strain contain mgsine within avrpi coding sequence loss avrpi lead discernible defect growth pathogenesis oryzae study reiterates role diverse transposable element offswitch agent acquisition gainofvirulence rice blast fungus prevalence avrpi correlate well avirulence pathotype diverse blast isolates philippine china thus supporting broadspectrum resistance conferred pi different rice growing area result revealed pi pizt pi locus activate race specific resistance recognizing sequenceunrelated avrpi avrpizt gene respectively,10,"{'Disease': ['highly early stage initiation blast disease virulent isolate strain'], 'Treatment': ['sequential planting method avrpi'], 'Symptom': ['magnaporthe oryzae avirulence effector avrpi cognate rice blast resistance gene pi comparative genomics requisite strain']}",8
32559183,"Marker Assisted Gene Pyramiding (MAGP) for bacterial blight and blast resistance into mega rice variety ""Tellahamsa"".","Bacterial blight (BB) and fungal blast diseases are the major biotic constraints that limit rice productivity. To sustain yield improvement in rice, it is necessary to developed yield potential of the rice varieties by incorporation of biotic stress resistance genes. Tellahamsa is a well-adapted popular high yielding rice variety in Telangana state, India. However, the variety is highly susceptible to BB and blast. In this study, simultaneous stepwise transfer of genes through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) strategy was used to introgress two major BB (Xa21 and xa13) and two major blast resistance genes (Pi54 and Pi1) into Tellahamsa. In each generation (from F1 to ICF3) foreground selection was done using gene-specific markers viz., pTA248 (Xa21), xa13prom (xa13), Pi54MAS (Pi54) and RM224 (Pi1).

28719243,Genotyping-by-Sequencing-Based Genetic Analysis of African Rice Cultivars and Association Mapping of Blast Resistance Genes Against Magnaporthe oryzae Populations in Africa.,"Understanding the genetic diversity of rice germplasm is important for the sustainable use of genetic materials in rice breeding and production. Africa is rich in rice genetic resources that can be utilized to boost rice productivity on the continent. A major constraint to rice production in Africa is rice blast, caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. In this report, we present the results of a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)-based diversity analysis of 190 African rice cultivars and an association mapping of blast resistance (R) genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The 190 African cultivars were clustered into three groups based on the 184K single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by GBS. We inoculated the rice cultivars with six African M. oryzae isolates. Association mapping identified 25 genomic regions associated with blast resistance (RABRs) in the rice genome. Moreover, PCR analysis indicated that RABR_23 is associated with the Pi-ta gene on chromosome 12. Our study demonstrates that the combination of GBS-based genetic diversity population analysis and association mapping is effective in identifying rice blast R genes/QTLs that contribute to resistance against African populations of M. oryzae. The identified markers linked to the RABRs and 14 highly resistant cultivars in this study will be useful for rice breeding in Africa.",understanding genetic diversity rice germplasm important sustainable use genetic material rice breeding production africa rich rice genetic resource utilized boost rice productivity continent major constraint rice production africa rice blast caused hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae report present result genotypingbysequencing gbsbased diversity analysis african rice cultivar association mapping blast resistance r gene quantitative trait locus qtls african cultivar clustered three group based k single nucleotide polymorphism generated gb inoculated rice cultivar six african oryzae isolates association mapping identified genomic region associated blast resistance rabrs rice genome moreover pcr analysis indicated rabr associated pita gene chromosome study demonstrates combination gbsbased genetic diversity population analysis association mapping effective identifying rice blast r genesqtls contribute resistance african population oryzae identified marker linked rabrs highly resistant cultivar study useful rice breeding africa,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13
25444707,Neck blast disease influences grain yield and quality traits of aromatic rice.,"A critical investigation was conducted to find out the effect of neck blast disease on yield-contributing characters, and seed quality traits of aromatic rice in Bangladesh. Both healthy and neck-blast-infected panicles of three aromatic rice cultivars (high-yielding and local) were collected and investigated at Plant Pathology Division, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), Gazipur, Bangladesh. All of the tested varieties were highly susceptible to neck blast disease under natural conditions, though no leaf blast symptoms appear on leaves. Neck blast disease increased grain sterility percentages, reduced grain size, yield and quality traits of seeds. The degrees of yield and seed quality reduction depended on disease severity and variety's genetic make-up. Unfilled grains were the main source of seed-borne pathogen, especially for blast in the seed lot. Transmission of blast pathogen from neck (panicle base) to seed was very poor. These findings are important, especially concerning the seed certification programme in which seed lots are certified on the basis of field inspection. Finally, controlled experiments are needed to draw more critical conclusions.",critical investigation conducted find effect neck blast disease yieldcontributing character seed quality trait aromatic rice bangladesh healthy neckblastinfected panicle three aromatic rice cultivar highyielding local collected investigated plant pathology division bangladesh rice research institute brri gazipur bangladesh tested variety highly susceptible neck blast disease natural condition though leaf blast symptom appear leaf neck blast disease increased grain sterility percentage reduced grain size yield quality trait seed degree yield seed quality reduction depended disease severity variety genetic makeup unfilled grain main source seedborne pathogen especially blast seed lot transmission blast pathogen neck panicle base seed poor finding important especially concerning seed certification programme seed lot certified basis field inspection finally controlled experiment needed draw critical conclusion,8,"{'Disease': ['effect neck blast disease yieldcontributing character seed quality trait aromatic rice bangladesh healthy neckblastinfected panicle', 'variety highly susceptible neck blast disease natural condition', 'leaf neck blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect neck blast disease yieldcontributing character seed quality trait aromatic rice bangladesh healthy neckblastinfected panicle', 'leaf blast symptom']}",10
39556648,The blast pathogen effector AVR-Pik binds and stabilizes rice heavy metal-associated (HMA) proteins to co-opt their function in immunity.,"Intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in immunity across multiple domains of life. In plants, a subset of NLRs contain noncanonical integrated domains that are thought to have evolved from host targets of pathogen effectors to serve as pathogen baits. However, the functions of host proteins with similarity to NLR integrated domains and the extent to which they are targeted by pathogen effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the blast fungus effector AVR-Pik binds a subset of related rice proteins containing a heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain, one of the domains that has repeatedly integrated into plant NLR immune receptors. We find that AVR-Pik binding stabilizes the rice small HMA (sHMA) proteins OsHIPP19 and OsHIPP20. Knockout of OsHIPP20 causes enhanced disease resistance towards the blast pathogen, indicating that OsHIPP20 is a susceptibility gene (S-gene). We propose that AVR-Pik has evolved to bind HMA domain proteins and co-opt their function to suppress immunity.

24043853,WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance.,"OsWRKY76 encodes a group IIa WRKY transcription factor of rice. The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid. Green fluorescent protein-fused OsWRKY76 localized to the nuclei in rice epidermal cells. OsWRKY76 showed sequence-specific DNA binding to the W-box element in vitro and exhibited W-box-mediated transcriptional repressor activity in cultured rice cells. Overexpression of OsWRKY76 in rice plants resulted in drastically increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, but improved tolerance to cold stress. Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non-transformed control plants. Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress-associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes. These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance.",oswrky encodes group iia wrky transcription factor rice expression oswrky induced within h inoculation rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae wounding low temperature benzothiadiazole abscisic acid green fluorescent proteinfused oswrky localized nucleus rice epidermal cell oswrky showed sequencespecific dna binding wbox element vitro exhibited wboxmediated transcriptional repressor activity cultured rice cell overexpression oswrky rice plant resulted drastically increased susceptibility oryzae improved tolerance cold stress microarray analysis revealed overexpression oswrky suppresses induction specific set pr gene gene involved phytoalexin synthesis inoculation blast fungus consistent observation level phytoalexins transgenic rice plant remained significantly lower nontransformed control plant furthermore overexpression oswrky led increased expression abiotic stressassociated gene peroxidase lipid metabolism gene result strongly suggest oswrky play dual opposing role blast disease resistance cold tolerance,12,"{'Disease': ['h inoculation rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'phytoalexin synthesis inoculation blast fungus consistent observation level', 'dual opposing role blast disease resistance cold tolerance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
28036378,Characterization and Fine Mapping of a Blast Resistant Gene Pi-jnw1 from the japonica Rice Landrace Jiangnanwan.,"Rice blast is a destructive disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, and it has a large impact on rice production worldwide. Compared with leaf blast resistance, our understanding of panicle blast resistance is limited. The japonica landrace Jiangnanwan from Taihu Lake region in China shows highly resistance to panicle and leaf blast. In this study, three generations (F2:5, F2:6, F2:7) consisting of 221 RILs (recombination inbreeding lines), developed from the cross of Jiangnanwan and Suyunuo, a susceptible-blast japonica variety, were evaluated for panicle blast resistance in the fields and leaf blast resistance in greenhouse in Nanjing in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

Biochemical and genetic studies revealed that OsATL32 suppresses pathogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of the ROS-producing OsRac5-OsRbohB module, which enhances rice immunity against M. oryzae. The protein phosphatase PHOSPHATASE AND TENSIN HOMOLOG enhances rice blast resistance by dephosphorylating OsATL32 and promoting its degradation, preventing its negative effect on rice immunity.

26498172,Identification of novel alleles of the rice blast resistance gene Pi54.,"Rice blast is one of the most devastating rice diseases and continuous resistance breeding is required to control the disease. The rice blast resistance gene Pi54 initially identified in an Indian cultivar confers broad-spectrum resistance in India. We explored the allelic diversity of the Pi54 gene among 885 Indian rice genotypes that were found resistant in our screening against field mixture of naturally existing M. oryzae strains as well as against five unique strains. These genotypes are also annotated as rice blast resistant in the International Rice Genebank database. Sequence-based allele mining was used to amplify and clone the Pi54 allelic variants. Nine new alleles of Pi54 were identified based on the nucleotide sequence comparison to the Pi54 reference sequence as well as to already known Pi54 alleles. DNA sequence analysis of the newly identified Pi54 alleles revealed several single polymorphic sites, three double deletions and an eight base pair deletion. A SNP-rich region was found between a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site and the nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain. Together, the newly identified Pi54 alleles expand the allelic series and are candidates for rice blast resistance breeding programs.",rice blast one devastating rice disease continuous resistance breeding required control disease rice blast resistance gene pi initially identified indian cultivar confers broadspectrum resistance india explored allelic diversity pi gene among indian rice genotype found resistant screening field mixture naturally existing oryzae strain well five unique strain genotype also annotated rice blast resistant international rice genebank database sequencebased allele mining used amplify clone pi allelic variant nine new allele pi identified based nucleotide sequence comparison pi reference sequence well already known pi allele dna sequence analysis newly identified pi allele revealed several single polymorphic site three double deletion eight base pair deletion snprich region found tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site nucleotide binding site nb domain together newly identified pi allele expand allelic series candidate rice blast resistance breeding program,10,"{'Disease': ['rice blast one devastating rice disease continuous resistance breeding required control disease rice blast resistance gene pi'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
19522564,Suppression of the rice fatty-acid desaturase gene OsSSI2 enhances resistance to blast and leaf blight diseases in rice.,"Fatty acids and their derivatives play important signaling roles in plant defense responses. It has been shown that suppressing a gene for stearoyl acyl carrier protein fatty-acid desaturase (SACPD) enhances the resistance of Arabidopsis (SSI2) and soybean to multiple pathogens. In this study, we present functional analyses of a rice homolog of SSI2 (OsSSI2) in disease resistance of rice plants. A transposon insertion mutation (Osssi2-Tos17) and RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsSSI2 (OsSSI2-kd) reduced the oleic acid (18:1) level and increased that of stearic acid (18:0), indicating that OsSSI2 is responsible for fatty-acid desaturase activity. These plants displayed spontaneous lesion formation in leaf blades, retarded growth, slight increase in endogenous free salicylic acid (SA) levels, and SA/benzothiadiazole (BTH)-specific inducible genes, including WRKY45, a key regulator of SA/BTH-induced resistance, in rice. Moreover, the OsSSI2-kd plants showed markedly enhanced resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and leaf-blight bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. These results suggest that OsSSI2 is involved in the negative regulation of defense responses in rice, as are its Arabidopsis and soybean counterparts. Microarray analyses identified 406 genes that were differentially expressed (>or=2-fold) in OsSSI2-kd rice plants compared with wild-type rice and, of these, approximately 39% were BTH responsive. Taken together, our results suggest that induction of SA-responsive genes, including WRKY45, is likely responsible for enhanced disease resistance in OsSSI2-kd rice plants.",fatty acid derivative play important signaling role plant defense response shown suppressing gene stearoyl acyl carrier protein fattyacid desaturase sacpd enhances resistance arabidopsis ssi soybean multiple pathogen study present functional analysis rice homolog ssi osssi disease resistance rice plant transposon insertion mutation osssitos rnaimediated knockdown osssi osssikd reduced oleic acid level increased stearic acid indicating osssi responsible fattyacid desaturase activity plant displayed spontaneous lesion formation leaf blade retarded growth slight increase endogenous free salicylic acid sa level sabenzothiadiazole bthspecific inducible gene including wrky key regulator sabthinduced resistance rice moreover osssikd plant showed markedly enhanced resistance blast fungus magnaporthe grisea leafblight bacteria xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae result suggest osssi involved negative regulation defense response rice arabidopsis soybean counterpart microarray analysis identified gene differentially expressed orfold osssikd rice plant compared wildtype rice approximately bth responsive taken together result suggest induction saresponsive gene including wrky likely responsible enhanced disease resistance osssikd rice plant,4,"{'Disease': ['functional analysis rice homolog ssi osssi disease resistance rice plant transposon insertion mutation osssitos', 'markedly enhanced resistance blast fungus magnaporthe grisea leafblight bacteria xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae result', 'wrky likely responsible enhanced disease resistance osssikd rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
28472292,Calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK10 mediates both drought tolerance and blast disease resistance in rice plants.,"Plant growth and productivity is negatively affected by different stresses. Most stresses trigger calcium signals that initiate acclimation responses in plants. The multigene family of plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) functions in multiple stress responses by transducing calcium signals into phosphorylation events. This work reports that the OsCPK10 isoform positively mediates tolerance to different stresses in rice plants by enhancing their antioxidant capacity and protecting them from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, with the uncontrolled generation of ROS being a common feature of these stresses. Here, we show that the constitutive accumulation of an HA-tagged OsCPK10 full-length protein enhances the hydrogen peroxide detoxifying capacity of rice plants during desiccation. This is achived by modulating the accumulation of catalase proteins, which reduces the extent of lipid peroxidation and protects the integrity of cell membranes, resulting in drought tolerance. OsCPK10HA accumulation also confers blast disease resistance by interfering with fungal necrotrophic growth via a reduction in the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, we show by bimolecular complementation assays that OsCPK10 is a plasma membrane protein that physically interacts in vivo with catalase A. OsCPK10 therefore appears to be a good molecular target to improve tolerance to abiotic stresses as well as to blast disease, which limit rice crop productivity.",plant growth productivity negatively affected different stress stress trigger calcium signal initiate acclimation response plant multigene family plant calciumdependent protein kinase cpks function multiple stress response transducing calcium signal phosphorylation event work report oscpk isoform positively mediates tolerance different stress rice plant enhancing antioxidant capacity protecting reactive oxygen specie ro damage uncontrolled generation ro common feature stress show constitutive accumulation hatagged oscpk fulllength protein enhances hydrogen peroxide detoxifying capacity rice plant desiccation achived modulating accumulation catalase protein reduces extent lipid peroxidation protects integrity cell membrane resulting drought tolerance oscpkha accumulation also confers blast disease resistance interfering fungal necrotrophic growth via reduction accumulation hydrogen peroxide furthermore show bimolecular complementation assay oscpk plasma membrane protein physically interacts vivo catalase oscpk therefore appears good molecular target improve tolerance abiotic stress well blast disease limit rice crop productivity,6,"{'Disease': ['blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
33121205,Improvement of Stable Restorer Lines for Blast Resistance through Functional Marker in Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.).,"Two popular stable restorer lines, CB 87 R and CB 174 R, were improved for blast resistance through marker-assisted back-cross breeding (MABB). The hybrid rice development program in South India extensively depends on these two restorer lines. However, these restorer lines are highly susceptible to blast disease. To improve the restorer lines for resistance against blasts, we introgressed the broad-spectrum dominant gene <i>Pi54</i> into these elite restorer lines through two independent crosses. Foreground selection for <i>Pi54</i> was done by using gene-specific functional marker, <i>Pi54 MAS,</i> at each back-cross generation. Back-crossing was continued until BC<sub>3</sub> and background analysis with seventy polymorphic SSRs covering all the twelve chromosomes to recover the maximum recurrent parent genome was done. At BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, closely linked gene-specific/SSR markers, DRRM-<i>RF3</i>-10, <i>DRCG-RF4</i>-8, and RM 6100, were used for the identification of fertility restoration genes, <i>Rf3</i> and <i>Rf4,</i> along with target gene (<i>Pi54</i>), respectively, in the segregating population. Subsequently, at BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>3</sub>, plants, homozygous for the <i>Pi54</i> and fertility restorer genes (<i>Rf3</i> and <i>Rf4</i>), were evaluated for blast disease resistance under uniform blast nursery (UBN) and pollen fertility status. Stringent phenotypic selection resulted in the identification of nine near-isogenic lines in CB 87 R × B 95 and thirteen in CB 174 R × B 95 as the promising restorer lines possessing blast disease resistance along with restoration ability.

16240149,Enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea conferred by expression of a cecropin A gene in transgenic rice.,"Cecropins are a family of antimicrobial peptides, which constitute an important key component of the immune response in insects. Here, we demonstrate that transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants expressing the cecropin A gene from the giant silk moth Hyalophora cecropia show enhanced resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of the rice blast disease. Two plant codon-optimized synthetic cecropin A genes, which were designed either to retain the cecropin A peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum, the ER-CecA gene, or to secrete cecropin A to the extracellular space, the Ap-CecA gene, were prepared. Both cecropin A genes were efficiently expressed in transgenic rice. The inhibitory activity of protein extracts prepared from leaves of cecropin A-expressing plants on the in vitro growth of M. grisea indicated that the cecropin A protein produced by the transgenic rice plants was biologically active. Whereas no effect on plant phenotype was observed in ER-CecA plants, most of the rice lines expressing the Ap-CecA gene were non-fertile. Cecropin A rice plants exhibited resistance to rice blast at various levels. Transgene expression of cecropin A genes was not accompanied by an induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression supporting that the transgene product itself is directly active against the pathogen. Taken together, the results presented in this study suggest that the cecropin A gene, when designed for retention of cecropin A into the endoplasmic reticulum, could be a useful candidate for protection of rice plants against the rice blast fungus M. grisea.",cecropins family antimicrobial peptide constitute important key component immune response insect demonstrate transgenic rice oryza sativa l plant expressing cecropin gene giant silk moth hyalophora cecropia show enhanced resistance magnaporthe grisea causal agent rice blast disease two plant codonoptimized synthetic cecropin gene designed either retain cecropin peptide endoplasmic reticulum erceca gene secrete cecropin extracellular space apceca gene prepared cecropin gene efficiently expressed transgenic rice inhibitory activity protein extract prepared leaf cecropin aexpressing plant vitro growth grisea indicated cecropin protein produced transgenic rice plant biologically active whereas effect plant phenotype observed erceca plant rice line expressing apceca gene nonfertile cecropin rice plant exhibited resistance rice blast various level transgene expression cecropin gene accompanied induction pathogenesisrelated pr gene expression supporting transgene product directly active pathogen taken together result presented study suggest cecropin gene designed retention cecropin endoplasmic reticulum could useful candidate protection rice plant rice blast fungus grisea,4,"{'Disease': ['enhanced resistance magnaporthe grisea causal agent rice blast disease', 'useful candidate protection rice plant rice blast fungus grisea'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect plant phenotype observed erceca plant rice line']}",7
28418377,The Magnaporthe oryzae nitrooxidative stress response suppresses rice innate immunity during blast disease.,"Understanding how microorganisms manipulate plant innate immunity and colonize host cells is a major goal of plant pathology. Here, we report that the fungal nitrooxidative stress response suppresses host defences to facilitate the growth and development of the important rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in leaf cells. Nitronate monooxygenases encoded by NMO genes catalyse the oxidative denitrification of nitroalkanes. We show that the M. oryzae NMO2 gene is required for mitigating damaging lipid nitration under nitrooxidative stress conditions and, consequently, for using nitrate and nitrite as nitrogen sources. On plants, the Δnmo2 mutant strain penetrated host cuticles like wild type, but invasive hyphal growth in rice cells was restricted and elicited plant immune responses that included the formation of cellular deposits and a host reactive oxygen species burst. Development of the M. oryzae effector-secreting biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) was misregulated in the Δnmo2 mutant. Inhibiting or quenching host reactive oxygen species suppressed rice innate immune responses and allowed the Δnmo2 mutant to grow and develop normally in infected cells. NMO2 is thus essential for mitigating nitrooxidative cellular damage and, in rice cells, maintaining redox balance to avoid triggering plant defences that impact M. oryzae growth and BIC development.",understanding microorganism manipulate plant innate immunity colonize host cell major goal plant pathology report fungal nitrooxidative stress response suppresses host defence facilitate growth development important rice pathogen magnaporthe oryzae leaf cell nitronate monooxygenases encoded nmo gene catalyse oxidative denitrification nitroalkanes show oryzae nmo gene required mitigating damaging lipid nitration nitrooxidative stress condition consequently using nitrate nitrite nitrogen source plant δnmo mutant strain penetrated host cuticle like wild type invasive hyphal growth rice cell restricted elicited plant immune response included formation cellular deposit host reactive oxygen specie burst development oryzae effectorsecreting biotrophic interfacial complex bic misregulated δnmo mutant inhibiting quenching host reactive oxygen specie suppressed rice innate immune response allowed δnmo mutant grow develop normally infected cell nmo thus essential mitigating nitrooxidative cellular damage rice cell maintaining redox balance avoid triggering plant defence impact oryzae growth bic development,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['plant defence impact']}",9
23696671,Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein Pb1 is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction.,"Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a panicle blast resistance gene derived from the indica rice cultivar ""Modan."" Pb1 encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein and confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae races. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Pb1-mediated blast resistance. The Pb1 protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Pb1-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a Pb1-containing rice cultivar. Leaf-blast resistance by Pb1 overexpression (Pb1-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/Pb1-ox rice. Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in Pb1-ox than in control Nipponbare rice. Overexpression of Pb1-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type Pb1. Overexpression of Pb1 with a nuclear export sequence failed to confer blast resistance to rice. These results suggest that the blast resistance of Pb1 depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus. In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of Pb1 enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in Pb1-dependent blast resistance.",panicle blast pb panicle blast resistance gene derived indica rice cultivar modan pb encodes coiledcoilnucleotidebinding siteleucinerich repeat ccnblrr protein confers durable broadspectrum resistance magnaporthe oryzae race investigated molecular mechanism underlying pbmediated blast resistance pb protein interacted wrky transcription factor involved induced resistance via salicylic acid signaling pathway regulated ubiquitin proteasome system pbmediated panicle blast resistance largely compromised wrky knocked pbcontaining rice cultivar leafblast resistance pb overexpression pbox also compromised wrky knockdownpbox rice blast infection induced higher accumulation wrky pbox control nipponbare rice overexpression pbquad coiledcoil domain mutant weak interaction wrky resulted significantly weaker blast resistance wildtype pb overexpression pb nuclear export sequence failed confer blast resistance rice result suggest blast resistance pb depends interaction wrky nucleus transient system using rice protoplast coexpression pb enhanced wrky accumulation increased wrkydependent transactivation activity suggesting protection wrky ubiquitin proteasome system degradation possibly involved pbdependent blast resistance,12,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

15478215,"Proteomic analysis of pathogen-responsive proteins from rice leaves induced by rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea.","Proteomic approaches using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) were adopted to identify proteins from rice leaf that are differentially expressed in response to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Microscopic observation of inoculated leaf with M. grisea revealed that callose deposition and hypersensitive response was clearly visible in incompatible interactions but excessive invading hypha with branches were evident in compatible interactions. Proteins were extracted from leaves 24, 48, and 72 hours after rice blast fungus inoculation. Eight proteins resolved on the 2-DE gels were induced or increased in the inoculated leaf. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight analysis of these differentially displayed proteins showed them to be two receptor-like protein kinases (RLK), two beta-1.3-glucanases (Glu1, Glu2), thaumatin-like protein (TLP), peroxidase (POX 22.3), probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1), and rice pathogenesis-related 10 (OsPR-10). Of these proteins, RLK, TLP, PBZ, and OsPR-10 proteins were induced more in the incompatible interactions than in compatible ones. A phytohormone, jasmonic acid also induced all eight proteins in leaves. To confirm whether the expression profile is equal to the 2-DE data, seven cDNA clones were used as probes in Northern hybridization experiments using total RNA from leaf tissues inoculated with incompatible and compatible rice blast fungal races. The genes encoding POX22.3, Glu1, Glu2, TLP, OsRLK, PBZ1, and OsPR-10 were activated in inoculated leaves, with TLP, OsRLK, PBZ1, and OsPR-10 being expressed earlier and more in incompatible than in compatible interactions. These results suggest that early and high induction of these genes may provide host plants with leading edges to defend themselves.

Here, we used a joint analysis of a genome-wide association study and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1, which acts as a QTL in rice against blast fungus. Heterogeneous expression of OsMP1 in yeast supported its function in transporting a wide range of amino acids, including Thr, Ser, Phe, His, and Glu. OsMP1 could also mediate 15N-Glu efflux and influx in Xenopus oocyte cells. The expression of OsMP1 was significantly induced by Magnaporthe oryzae in the resistant rice landrace Heikezijing, whereas no such induction was observed in the susceptible landrace Suyunuo. Overexpressing OsMP1 in Suyunuo enhanced disease resistance to blast fungus and leaf blight bacterium without resulting in a yield penalty. In addition, the overexpression of OsMP1 led to increased accumulation of Thr, Ser, Phe, and His in the leaves and this contributed to the reduced disease susceptibility, which was associated with up-regulation of the jasmonic acid pathway.

37807096,An Efficient Method for Screening Rice Breeding Lines Against Races of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.,"Rice blast, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most destructive rice disease worldwide. The disease symptoms are usually expressed on the leaf and panicle. The leaf disease intensity in controlled environmental conditions is frequently quantified using a 0 to 5 scale, where 0 represents the absence of symptoms, and 5 represents large eyespot lesions. However, this scale restricts the qualitative classification of the varieties into intermediate resistant and susceptible categories. Here, we develop a 0 to 6 scale for blast disease that allows proper assignment of rice breeding lines and varieties into six resistance levels (highly resistant, resistant, moderately resistant, moderately susceptible, susceptible, and highly susceptible). We evaluated 40 common rice varieties against four major blast races (IB1, IB17, IB49, and IE1-K). Varieties carrying the <i>Pi-ta</i> gene were either highly resistant, resistant, or moderately resistant to IB17. The IE1-K race was able to break <i>Pi-ta</i>-mediated resistance of the rice varieties. The <i>Pi-z</i> gene conferred resistance to the IB17 and IE1-K races. The varieties M201, Cheniere, and Frontier were highly susceptible (score 6; 100% disease) to the race IE1-K. Moreover, varieties that were resistant or susceptible to all four blast races also showed similar levels of resistance/susceptibility to blast disease in the field. Taken together, our data proved that the 0 to 6 blast scale can efficiently determine the resistance levels of rice varieties against major blast races. This robust method will assist rice breeding programs to incorporate durable resistance against major and emerging blast races.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

39180632,Deciphering early responsive signature genes in rice blast disease: an integrated temporal transcriptomic study.,"Rice blast disease, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, reigns as the top-most cereal killer, jeopardizing global food security. This necessitates the timely scouting of pathogen stress-responsive genes during the early infection stages. Thus, we integrated time-series microarray (GSE95394) and RNA-Seq (GSE131641) datasets to decipher rice transcriptome responses at 12- and 24-h post-infection (Hpi). Our analysis revealed 1580 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) overlapped between datasets. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for these DEGs and identified significant subnetworks using the MCODE plugin. Further analysis with CytoHubba highlighted eight plausible hub genes for pathogenesis: RPL8 (upregulated) and RPL27, OsPRPL3, RPL21, RPL9, RPS5, OsRPS9, and RPL17 (downregulated). We validated the expression levels of these hub genes in response to infection, finding that RPL8 exhibited significantly higher expression compared with other downregulated genes. Remarkably, RPL8 formed a distinct cluster in the co-expression network, whereas other hub genes were interconnected, with RPL9 playing a central role, indicating its pivotal role in coordinating gene expression during infection. Gene Ontology highlighted the enrichment of hub genes in the ribosome and protein translation processes. Prior studies suggested that plant immune defence activation diminishes the energy pool by suppressing ribosomes. Intriguingly, our study aligns with this phenomenon, as the identified ribosomal proteins (RPs) were suppressed, while RPL8 expression was activated. We anticipate that these RPs could be targeted to develop new stress-resistant rice varieties, beyond their housekeeping role. Overall, integrating transcriptomic data revealed more common DEGs, enhancing the reliability of our analysis and providing deeper insights into rice blast disease mechanisms.",rice blast disease caused magnaporthe oryzae reign topmost cereal killer jeopardizing global food security necessitates timely scouting pathogen stressresponsive gene early infection stage thus integrated timeseries microarray gse rnaseq gse datasets decipher rice transcriptome response h postinfection hpi analysis revealed differentially expressed gene degs overlapped datasets constructed proteinprotein interaction ppi network degs identified significant subnetworks using mcode plugin analysis cytohubba highlighted eight plausible hub gene pathogenesis rpl upregulated rpl osprpl rpl rpl rps osrps rpl downregulated validated expression level hub gene response infection finding rpl exhibited significantly higher expression compared downregulated gene remarkably rpl formed distinct cluster coexpression network whereas hub gene interconnected rpl playing central role indicating pivotal role coordinating gene expression infection gene ontology highlighted enrichment hub gene ribosome protein translation process prior study suggested plant immune defence activation diminishes energy pool suppressing ribosome intriguingly study aligns phenomenon identified ribosomal protein rps suppressed rpl expression activated anticipate rps could targeted develop new stressresistant rice variety beyond housekeeping role overall integrating transcriptomic data revealed common degs enhancing reliability analysis providing deeper insight rice blast disease mechanism,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'deeper insight rice blast disease mechanism'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

Transgenic rice expressing NS3 also showed enhanced resistance to the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Meanwhile, expressional levels of genes related to the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways were not significantly altered, indicating that the defense to M. oryzae was independent of the SA and JA pathways.

16709195,A B-lectin receptor kinase gene conferring rice blast resistance.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide. The dominant resistance gene, Pi-d2 [previously named Pi-d(t)2], present in the rice variety Digu, confers gene-for-gene resistance to the Chinese blast strain, ZB15. Pi-d2 was previously mapped close to the centromere of chromosome 6. In this study, the Pi-d2 gene was isolated by a map-based cloning strategy. Pi-d2 encodes a receptor-like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of a bulb-type mannose specific binding lectin (B-lectin) and an intracellular serine-threonine kinase domain. Pi-d2 is a single-copy gene that is constitutively expressed in the rice variety Digu. Transgenic plants carrying the Pi-d2 transgene confer race-specific resistance to the M. grisea strain, ZB15. The Pi-d2 protein is plasma membrane localized. A single amino acid difference at position 441 of Pi-d2 distinguishes resistant and susceptible alleles of rice blast resistance gene Pi-d2.

Allele-specific PCR markers and insertion/deletion (InDel) markers, which genotype single-nucleotide polymorphisms and InDel polymorphisms, respectively, are useful tools for marker-assisted selections. We developed sets of allele-specific PCR and InDel markers for nine rice blast resistance genes -- Piz, Piz-t, Pit, Pik, Pik-m, Pik-p, Pita, Pita-2, and Pib -- which are commonly used in Japanese blast resistance rice breeding programs. For each resistance gene, we used the segregation information from thousands of progeny in several crosses or published gene locations to generate a marker that cosegregated with the gene and markers that closely flanked the gene on either side. The developed cosegregating markers uniquely discriminated among each of the lines with the individual resistance genes (except for Pita and Pita-2). Therefore, these markers will likely facilitate the development of multiline cultivars carrying one or a combination of these nine blast resistance genes. In addition, the systems we developed may be valuable tools in the quality control of seed production from blast-resistant multiline cultivars.",blast resistance one important trait rice breeding application molecular marker blast resistance breeding likely allow rapid screening trait early growth stage without need inoculation pathogen phenotyping allelespecific pcr marker insertiondeletion indel marker genotype singlenucleotide polymorphism indel polymorphism respectively useful tool markerassisted selection developed set allelespecific pcr indel marker nine rice blast resistance gene piz pizt pit pik pikm pikp pita pita pib commonly used japanese blast resistance rice breeding program resistance gene used segregation information thousand progeny several cross published gene location generate marker cosegregated gene marker closely flanked gene either side developed cosegregating marker uniquely discriminated among line individual resistance gene except pita pita therefore marker likely facilitate development multiline cultivar carrying one combination nine blast resistance gene addition system developed may valuable tool quality control seed production blastresistant multiline cultivar,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13
18987215,Rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) infects Arabidopsis via a mechanism distinct from that required for the infection of rice.,"Magnaporthe oryzae is a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen that causes rice (Oryza sativa) blast. Although M. oryzae as a whole infects a wide variety of monocotyledonous hosts, no dicotyledonous plant has been reported as a host. We found that two rice pathogenic strains of M. oryzae, KJ201 and 70-15, interacted differentially with 16 ecotypes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Strain KJ201 infected all ecotypes with varying degrees of virulence, whereas strain 70-15 caused no symptoms in certain ecotypes. In highly susceptible ecotypes, small chlorotic lesions appeared on infected leaves within 3 d after inoculation and subsequently expanded across the affected leaves. The fungus produced spores in susceptible ecotypes but not in resistant ecotypes. Fungal cultures recovered from necrotic lesions caused the same symptoms in healthy plants, satisfying Koch's postulates. Histochemical analyses showed that infection by the fungus caused an accumulation of reactive oxygen species and eventual cell death. Similar to the infection process in rice, the fungus differentiated to form appressorium and directly penetrated the leaf surface in Arabidopsis. However, the pathogenic mechanism in Arabidopsis appears distinct from that in rice; three fungal genes essential for pathogenicity in rice played only limited roles in causing disease symptoms in Arabidopsis, and the fungus seems to colonize Arabidopsis as a necrotroph through the secretion of phytotoxic compounds, including 9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Expression of PR-1 and PDF1.2 was induced in response to infection by the fungus, suggesting the activation of salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid/ethylene-dependent signaling pathways. However, the roles of these signaling pathways in defense against M. oryzae remain unclear. In combination with the wealth of genetic and genomic resources available for M. oryzae, this newly established pathosystem allows comparison of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and host defense in two well-studied model plants.",magnaporthe oryzae hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen cause rice oryza sativa blast although oryzae whole infects wide variety monocotyledonous host dicotyledonous plant reported host found two rice pathogenic strain oryzae kj interacted differentially ecotypes arabidopsis arabidopsis thaliana strain kj infected ecotypes varying degree virulence whereas strain caused symptom certain ecotypes highly susceptible ecotypes small chlorotic lesion appeared infected leaf within inoculation subsequently expanded across affected leaf fungus produced spore susceptible ecotypes resistant ecotypes fungal culture recovered necrotic lesion caused symptom healthy plant satisfying koch postulate histochemical analysis showed infection fungus caused accumulation reactive oxygen specie eventual cell death similar infection process rice fungus differentiated form appressorium directly penetrated leaf surface arabidopsis however pathogenic mechanism arabidopsis appears distinct rice three fungal gene essential pathogenicity rice played limited role causing disease symptom arabidopsis fungus seems colonize arabidopsis necrotroph secretion phytotoxic compound including octadecadienoic acid expression pr pdf induced response infection fungus suggesting activation salicylic acid jasmonic acidethylenedependent signaling pathway however role signaling pathway defense oryzae remain unclear combination wealth genetic genomic resource available oryzae newly established pathosystem allows comparison molecular cellular mechanism underlying pathogenesis host defense two wellstudied model plant,3,"{'Disease': ['affected leaf fungus', 'infection fungus', 'accumulation reactive oxygen specie eventual cell death similar infection process rice fungus differentiated form appressorium directly penetrated leaf surface arabidopsis however pathogenic mechanism arabidopsis', 'disease symptom arabidopsis fungus', 'pr pdf induced response infection fungus suggesting activation salicylic acid jasmonic acidethylenedependent'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['symptom certain ecotypes', 'symptom healthy plant', 'disease symptom arabidopsis fungus']}",7

29549093,<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice.,"MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast disease, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important disease of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice blast disease, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast disease. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued disease symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity.

Knockout mutants of OsVQ25 exhibit enhanced resistance to both pathogens without a growth penalty. Furthermore, OsVQ25 interacts with and suppresses the transcriptional activity of OsWRKY53, a positive regulator of plant immunity.

17012402,Contribution of ethylene biosynthesis for resistance to blast fungus infection in young rice plants.,"The role of ethylene (ET) in resistance to infection with blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) in rice (Oryza sativa) is poorly understood. To study it, we quantified ET levels after inoculation, using young rice plants at the four-leaf stage of rice cv Nipponbare (wild type) and its isogenic plant (IL7), which contains the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus race 003. Small necrotic lesions by hypersensitive reaction (HR) were formed at 42 to 72 h postinoculation (hpi) in resistant IL7 leaves, and whitish expanding lesions at 96 hpi in susceptible wild-type leaves. Notable was the enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi accompanied by increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) levels and highly elevated ACC oxidase (ACO) activity in IL7 leaves, whereas only an enhanced ACC increase at 96 hpi in wild-type leaves. Among six ACC synthase (ACS) and seven ACO genes found in the rice genome, OsACS2 was transiently expressed at 48 hpi in IL7 and at 96 hpi in wild type, and OsACO7 was expressed at 48 hpi in IL7. Treatment with an inhibitor for ACS, aminooxyacetic acid, suppressed enhanced ET emission at 48 hpi in IL7, resulting in expanding lesions instead of HR lesions. Exogenously supplied ACC compromised the aminooxyacetic acid-induced breakdown of resistance in IL7, and treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene and silver thiosulfate, inhibitors of ET action, did not suppress resistance. These findings suggest the importance of ET biosynthesis and, consequently, the coproduct, cyanide, for HR-accompanied resistance to blast fungus in young rice plants and the contribution of induced OsACS2 and OsACO7 gene expression to it.",role ethylene et resistance infection blast fungus magnaporthe grisea rice oryza sativa poorly understood study quantified et level inoculation using young rice plant fourleaf stage rice cv nipponbare wild type isogenic plant il contains pii resistance gene blast fungus race small necrotic lesion hypersensitive reaction hr formed h postinoculation hpi resistant il leaf whitish expanding lesion hpi susceptible wildtype leaf notable enhanced et emission hpi accompanied increased aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid acc level highly elevated acc oxidase aco activity il leaf whereas enhanced acc increase hpi wildtype leaf among six acc synthase ac seven aco gene found rice genome osacs transiently expressed hpi il hpi wild type osaco expressed hpi il treatment inhibitor ac aminooxyacetic acid suppressed enhanced et emission hpi il resulting expanding lesion instead hr lesion exogenously supplied acc compromised aminooxyacetic acidinduced breakdown resistance il treatment methylcyclopropene silver thiosulfate inhibitor et action suppress resistance finding suggest importance et biosynthesis consequently coproduct cyanide hraccompanied resistance blast fungus young rice plant contribution induced osacs osaco gene expression,4,"{'Disease': ['role ethylene et resistance infection blast fungus magnaporthe', 'pii resistance gene blast fungus race small necrotic lesion hypersensitive reaction'], 'Treatment': ['hpi il treatment inhibitor ac aminooxyacetic acid', 'treatment methylcyclopropene silver thiosulfate inhibitor et action suppress resistance finding'], 'Symptom': []}",8
29040362,Prediction of protein-protein interactions between fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) and rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea (M. grisea) is one of the most serious diseases for the cultivated rice Oryza sativa (O. sativa). A key factor causing rice blast disease and defense might be protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between rice and fungus. In this research, we have developed a computational pipeline to predict PPIs between blast fungus and rice. After cross-prediction by interolog-based and domain-based method, we achieved 532 potential PPIs between 27 fungus proteins and 236 rice proteins. Accuracy of jackknife test, 10-fold cross-validation test and independent test for these PPIs were 90.43, 93.85 and 84.67%, respectively, by using support vector machine classification method. Meanwhile, the pathogenic genes of blast fungus were enriched in the predicted PPIs network when compared with 1000 random interaction networks. The rice regulatory network was downloaded and divided into 228 subnetworks with over six nodes, and the top seven subnetworks affected by blast fungus through PPIs were investigated. The results indicated that 34 upregulated and 12 downregulated master regulators in rice interacting with the fungus proteins in response to the infection of blast fungus. The common master regulators in rice in response to the infection of M. grisea, Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae and rice stripe virus were analyzed.

14673787,Proteomic analysis of differentially expressed proteins induced by rice blast fungus and elicitor in suspension-cultured rice cells.,"We used two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and other proteomic approaches to identify proteins expressed in suspension-cultured rice cells in response to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea. Proteins were extracted from suspension-cultured cells at 24 and 48 h after rice blast fungus inoculation or treatment with elicitor or other signal molecules such as jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid, and H(2)O(2). The proteins were then polyethylene glycol fractionated before separation by 2-DE. Fourteen protein spots were induced or increased by the treatments, which we analyzed by N-terminal or internal amino acid sequencing. Twelve proteins from six different genes were identified. Rice pathogen-related protein class 10 (OsPR-10), isoflavone reductase like protein, beta-glucosidase, and putative receptor-like protein kinase were among those induced by rice blast fungus; these have not previously been reported in suspension-cultured rice cells. Six isoforms of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) and two isoforms of salt-induced protein (SalT) that responded to blast fungus, elicitor, and JA were also resolved on a 2-DE gel and identified by proteome analysis.

32072745,Phosphate excess increases susceptibility to pathogen infection in rice.,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for plant growth and productivity. Due to soil fixation, however, phosphorus availability in soil is rarely sufficient to sustain high crop yields. The overuse of fertilizers to circumvent the limited bioavailability of phosphate (Pi) has led to a scenario of excessive soil P in agricultural soils. Whereas adaptive responses to Pi deficiency have been deeply studied, less is known about how plants adapt to Pi excess and how Pi excess might affect disease resistance. We show that high Pi fertilization, and subsequent Pi accumulation, enhances susceptibility to infection by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae in rice. This fungus is the causal agent of the blast disease, one of the most damaging diseases of cultivated rice worldwide. Equally, MIR399f overexpression causes an increase in Pi content in rice leaves, which results in enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae. During pathogen infection, a weaker activation of defence-related genes occurs in rice plants over-accumulating Pi in leaves, which is in agreement with the phenotype of blast susceptibility observed in these plants. These data support that Pi, when in excess, compromises defence mechanisms in rice while demonstrating that miR399 functions as a negative regulator of rice immunity. The two signalling pathways, Pi signalling and defence signalling, must operate in a coordinated manner in controlling disease resistance. This information provides a basis to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in immunity in rice plants under high Pi fertilization, an aspect that should be considered in management of the rice blast disease.",phosphorus p essential nutrient plant growth productivity due soil fixation however phosphorus availability soil rarely sufficient sustain high crop yield overuse fertilizer circumvent limited bioavailability phosphate pi led scenario excessive soil p agricultural soil whereas adaptive response pi deficiency deeply studied less known plant adapt pi excess pi excess might affect disease resistance show high pi fertilization subsequent pi accumulation enhances susceptibility infection fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae rice fungus causal agent blast disease one damaging disease cultivated rice worldwide equally mirf overexpression cause increase pi content rice leaf result enhanced susceptibility oryzae pathogen infection weaker activation defencerelated gene occurs rice plant overaccumulating pi leaf agreement phenotype blast susceptibility observed plant data support pi excess compromise defence mechanism rice demonstrating mir function negative regulator rice immunity two signalling pathway pi signalling defence signalling must operate coordinated manner controlling disease resistance information provides basis understand molecular mechanism involved immunity rice plant high pi fertilization aspect considered management rice blast disease,10,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae rice fungus causal agent blast disease', 'one damaging disease', 'coordinated manner controlling disease resistance information'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
30590260,The rice ethylene response factor OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a novel ethylene response factor (ERF) gene, OsERF83, which was expressed in rice leaves in response to rice blast fungus infection. OsERF83 expression was also induced by treatments with methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and salicylic acid, indicating that multiple phytohormones could be involved in the regulation of OsERF83 expression under biotic stress. Subcellular localization and transactivation analyses demonstrated that OsERF83 is a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator. A gel-shift assay using recombinant OsERF83 protein indicated that, like other ERFs, it binds to the GCC box. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsERF83 exhibited significantly suppressed lesion formation after rice blast infection, indicating that OsERF83 positively regulates disease resistance in rice. Genes encoding several classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, including PR1, PR2, PR3, PR5, and PR10, were upregulated in the OsERF83ox plants.

38722963,A pharmacological approach to investigating effector translocation in rice-<i>Magnaporthe</i> oryzae interactions.,"Fungal pathogens deliver effector proteins into living plant cells to suppress plant immunity and control plant processes that are needed for infection. During plant infection, the devastating rice blast fungus, <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, forms the specialized biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), which is essential for effector translocation. Cytoplasmic effectors are first focally secreted into BICs, and subsequently packaged into dynamic membranous effector compartments (MECs), then translocated via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) into the host cytoplasm. This study demonstrates that clathrin-heavy chain inhibitors endosidin-9 (ES9) and endosidin-9-17 (ES9-17) blocked the internalization of the fluorescently labeled effectors Bas1 and Pwl2 in rice cells, leading to swollen BICs lacking MECs. In contrast, ES9-17 treatment had no impact on the localization pattern of the apoplastic effector Bas4. This study provides further evidence that cytoplasmic effector translocation occurs by CME in BICs, suggesting a potential role for <i>M. oryzae</i> effectors in co-opting plant endocytosis.",fungal pathogen deliver effector protein living plant cell suppress plant immunity control plant process needed infection plant infection devastating rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei form specialized biotrophic interfacial complex bic essential effector translocation cytoplasmic effector first focally secreted bics subsequently packaged dynamic membranous effector compartment mecs translocated via clathrinmediated endocytosis cme host cytoplasm study demonstrates clathrinheavy chain inhibitor endosidin e endosidin e blocked internalization fluorescently labeled effector ba pwl rice cell leading swollen bics lacking mecs contrast e treatment impact localization pattern apoplastic effector ba study provides evidence cytoplasmic effector translocation occurs cme bics suggesting potential role im oryzaei effector coopting plant endocytosis,3,"{'Disease': ['infection plant infection devastating rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei form specialized biotrophic interfacial complex bic essential effector translocation cytoplasmic effector'], 'Treatment': ['swollen bics lacking mecs contrast e treatment impact localization pattern apoplastic effector ba study'], 'Symptom': ['effector protein living plant cell suppress plant immunity control plant process', 'infection plant infection devastating rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei form specialized biotrophic interfacial complex bic essential effector translocation cytoplasmic effector', 'subsequently packaged dynamic membranous effector compartment mecs', 'swollen bics lacking mecs contrast e treatment impact localization pattern apoplastic effector ba study', 'evidence cytoplasmic effector translocation', 'oryzaei effector coopting plant endocytosis']}",7

The chlorophyll content and photosynthesis were also measured to further understand the disruptive effects that M. oryzae has on infected plants of these varieties. Real-time PCR was used to explore the differential expression of eight blast resistance genes among the ten local varieties. Blast disease has destructive effects on the growth of rice, and the findings of our study provide evidence that the Pikh, Pi9, Pi21, and Osw45 genes are involved in defence responses in the leaves of Malaysian rice at 31 h after inoculation with M. oryzae pathotype P7.2. Both the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis were reduced, but the levels of Pikh gene expression remained constant in susceptible varieties, with a developed pathogen population and mild or severe symptoms.

Marker-assisted foreground selection was performed using RM6836 and RM8225 to identify plants possessing blast resistance genes. Seventy microsatellite markers were used to estimate recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery. Our analysis led to the development of 13 improved blast resistant lines with Piz, Pi2 and Pi9 broad-spectrum blast resistance genes and an MR219 genetic background.

31001874,Osa-miR167d facilitates infection of Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in rice response to Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative agent of rice blast disease. Studying the roles of rice miRNAs is of great significance for the disease control. Osa-miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses. Here, we show that Osa-miR167d plays a negative role in rice immunity against M. oryzae by suppressing its target gene. The expression of Osa-miR167d was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 h post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M. oryzae infection. Transgenic rice lines over-expressing Osa-miR167d were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains. By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block Osa-miR167d enhanced resistance to rice blast disease. In addition, knocking out the target gene ARF12 led to hyper-susceptibility to multiple blast fungal strains. Taken together, our results indicate that Osa-miR167d negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M. oryzae by downregulating ARF12.

32777117,Identification and application of the Pigm-1 gene in rice disease resistance breeding.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. The identification and utilization of resistance genes are crucial and significant for breeding resistant rice cultivars. We identified a resistance gene from Shuangkang77009, which is highly resistant to the rice blast isolate Guy11 using map-based cloning. We performed bulked segregant analysis combined with specific length amplified fragment sequencing. We also performed association analysis, candidate gene prediction and cDNA sequencing to identify the candidate gene. The resistance gene is located on chromosome 6, and we ultimately mapped the resistance locus to a 92-kb region. The resistance gene in Shuangkang77009 was allelic to PigmR, hereafter referred to as Pigm-1. The Pigm-1 protein had one amino acid change: serine (Ser) residue 860 was replaced by tyrosine (Tyr) in Pigm-1 compared with the previously identified Pigm protein, which significantly changed the structure of the Pigm-1 protein based on 3-D structure simulation. In addition, using the developed molecular marker linked to the Pigm-1 gene and molecular marker-assisted selection technology, we introduced the Pigm-1 gene into Minghui86, a widely used and excellent restorer. We generated 11 stable homozygous rice lines with desirable agronomic traits and strong resistance to rice blast.

18513376,Physiological and cytological mechanisms of silicon-induced resistance in rice against blast disease.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the most destructive diseases in the rice-growing areas of the world. Silicon is an important nutritional element especially for rice. Two near-isogenic lines of rice with different resistance to blast disease, i.e. CO39 (susceptible) and C101LAC (Pi-1) (resistant), were selected to determine the effects of Si amendment on the severity and incidence of rice blast disease. The physiological and cytological mechanisms involved in the induced disease resistance by silicon were investigated. Exogenous Si application at a concentration of 2 mM reduced the disease index by 45% for CO39 and 56% for C101LAC (Pi-1). Si application alone did not change lignin content and the activities of defense-related enzymes including peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) in rice leaves of both isogenic lines. However, after inoculation with M. grisea, Si-treated rice plants significantly increased the activities of POD, PPO and PAL in leaves of both isogenic lines. Si and lignin content were also significantly increased in Si-treated inoculated seedlings. Environmental scanning electron microscope observations revealed that Si amendment resulted in higher Si deposit on dumbbell bodies in the rice leaves and silicon papilla accumulation on the guard cell of stoma.

In a modernized agricultural system, the development of varieties with broad-spectrum and durable resistance to blast disease is essential for increased rice production and sustainability. In this study, a new gene is identified in the introgression line IR65482-4-136-2-2 that has inherited the resistance gene from an EE genome wild Oryza species, O. australiensis (Acc. 100882). Genetic and molecular analysis localized a major resistance gene, Pi40(t), on the short arm of chromosome 6, where four blast resistance genes (Piz, Piz-5, Piz-t, and Pi9) were also identified, flanked by the markers S2539 and RM3330. Through e-Landing, 14 BAC/PAC clones within the 1.81-Mb equivalent virtual contig were identified on Rice Pseudomolecule3. Highly stringent primer sets designed for 6 NBS-LRR motifs located within PAC clone P0649C11 facilitated high-resolution mapping of the new resistance gene, Pi40(t). Following association analysis and detailed haplotyping approaches, a DNA marker, 9871.T7E2b, was identified to be linked to the Pi40(t) gene at the 70 Kb chromosomal region, and differentiated the Pi40(t) gene from the LTH monogenic differential lines possessing genes Piz, Piz-5, Piz-t, and Pi-9. Pi40(t) was validated using the most virulent isolates of Korea as well as the Philippines, suggesting a broad spectrum for the resistance gene.

The objective of this study was to assess the leaf blast-suppressing effects of rice phylloplane fungi. One Cladosporium sp. phylloplane fungus was shown to possess biocontrolling traits based on its morphological characteristics and an analysis of its 18S ribosomal DNA. Experiments aimed at determining the optimal time to apply the bioagent and the mechanisms involved in its rice blast-suppressing activities were performed under controlled greenhouse conditions. We used foliar spraying to apply the Cladosporium sp. 48 h prior to applying the pathogen, and we found that this increased the enzymatic activity. Furthermore, in vitro tests performed using isolate C24 showed that it possessed the ability to secrete endoxylanases and endoglucanases. When Cladosporium sp. was applied either prior to or simultaneous with the pathogen, we observed a significant increase in defence enzyme activity, and rice blast was suppressed by 84.0 and 78.6 %, respectively. However, some enzymes showed higher activity at 24 h while others did so at 48 h after the challenge inoculation.

31863525,Osa-miR1873 fine-tunes rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae and yield traits.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to fine-tune growth, development, and stress-induced responses. Osa-miR1873 is a rice-specific miRNA targeting LOC_Os05g01790. Here, we show that Osa-miR1873 fine-tunes rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae and yield traits via LOC_Os05g01790. Osa-miR1873 was significantly upregulated in a susceptible accession but downregulated in a resistance accession at 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) of M. oryzae. Overexpressing Osa-miR1873 enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae and compromised induction of defense responses. In contrast, blocking Osa-miR1873 through target mimicry compromised susceptibility to M. oryzae and enhanced induction of defense responses. Altered expression of Osa-miR1873 also resulted in some defects in yield traits, including grain numbers and seed setting rate. Moreover, overexpression of the target gene LOC_Os05g01790 increased rice blast disease resistance but severely penalized growth and yield. Taken together, we demonstrate that Osa-miR1873 fine-tunes the rice immunity-growth trade-off via LOC_Os05g01790, and blocking Osa-miR1873 could improve blast disease resistance without significant yield penalty. Thus, the Osa-miR1873-LOC_Os05g01790 regulatory module is valuable in balancing yield traits and blast resistance.",micrornas mirnas known finetune growth development stressinduced response osamir ricespecific mirna targeting locosg show osamir finetunes rice immunity magnaporthe oryzae yield trait via locosg osamir significantly upregulated susceptible accession downregulated resistance accession h postinoculation hpi oryzae overexpressing osamir enhanced susceptibility oryzae compromised induction defense response contrast blocking osamir target mimicry compromised susceptibility oryzae enhanced induction defense response altered expression osamir also resulted defect yield trait including grain number seed setting rate moreover overexpression target gene locosg increased rice blast disease resistance severely penalized growth yield taken together demonstrate osamir finetunes rice immunitygrowth tradeoff via locosg blocking osamir could improve blast disease resistance without significant yield penalty thus osamirlocosg regulatory module valuable balancing yield trait blast resistance,8,"{'Disease': ['moreover overexpression target gene locosg increased rice blast disease resistance', 'blast disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
26940322,Exogenous proteinogenic amino acids induce systemic resistance in rice.,"Plant immune responses can be induced by endogenous and exogenous signaling molecules. Recently, amino acids and their metabolites have been reported to affect the plant immune system. However, how amino acids act in plant defense responses has yet to be clarified. Here, we report that treatment of rice roots with amino acids such as glutamate (Glu) induced systemic disease resistance against rice blast in leaves. Treatment of roots with Glu activated the transcription of a large variety of defense-related genes both in roots and leaves. In leaves, salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes, rather than jasmonic acid (JA) or ethylene (ET)-responsive genes, were induced by this treatment. The Glu-induced blast resistance was partially impaired in rice plants deficient in SA signaling such as NahG plants expressing an SA hydroxylase, WRKY45-knockdown, and OsNPR1-knockdown plants. The JA-deficient mutant cpm2 exhibited full Glu-induced blast resistance. Our results indicate that the amino acid-induced blast resistance partly depends on the SA pathway but an unknown SA-independent signaling pathway is also involved.",plant immune response induced endogenous exogenous signaling molecule recently amino acid metabolite reported affect plant immune system however amino acid act plant defense response yet clarified report treatment rice root amino acid glutamate glu induced systemic disease resistance rice blast leaf treatment root glu activated transcription large variety defenserelated gene root leaf leaf salicylic acid saresponsive gene rather jasmonic acid ja ethylene etresponsive gene induced treatment gluinduced blast resistance partially impaired rice plant deficient sa signaling nahg plant expressing sa hydroxylase wrkyknockdown osnprknockdown plant jadeficient mutant cpm exhibited full gluinduced blast resistance result indicate amino acidinduced blast resistance partly depends sa pathway unknown saindependent signaling pathway also involved,4,"{'Disease': ['yet clarified report treatment rice root amino acid glutamate glu induced systemic disease resistance rice blast leaf treatment root glu'], 'Treatment': ['yet clarified report treatment rice root amino acid glutamate glu induced systemic disease resistance rice blast leaf treatment root glu', 'treatment gluinduced blast resistance partially impaired rice plant deficient sa signaling nahg plant'], 'Symptom': []}",8

Foreground selection for target gene(s) was followed by arduous phenotypic and background selection which fast-tracked the recovery of recurrent parent genome (RPG) to an extent of 95.8% in one of the near-isogenic lines (NILs) namely, Pusa 1728-23-33-31-56, which also showed high degree of resemblance to recurrent parent, PB6 in phenotype. The phenotypic selection prior to background selection provided an additional opportunity for identifying the novel recombinants viz., Pusa 1884-9-12-14 and Pusa 1884-3-9-175, superior to parental lines in terms of early maturity, higher yield and improved quality parameters. There was no significant difference between the RPG recovery estimated based on SSR or SNP markers, however, the panel of SNPs markers was considered as the better choice for background selection as it provided better genome coverage and included SNPs in the genic regions. Multi-location evaluation of NILs depicted their stable and high mean performance in comparison to the respective recurrent parents. The Pi2+Pi54 carrying NILs were effective in combating a pan-India panel of Magnaporthe oryzae isolates with high level of field resistance in northern, eastern and southern parts of India.

15888683,Large-scale identification of expressed sequence tags involved in rice and rice blast fungus interaction.,"To better understand the molecular basis of the defense response against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), a large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing approach was used to identify genes involved in the early infection stages in rice (Oryza sativa). Six cDNA libraries were constructed using infected leaf tissues harvested from 6 conditions: resistant, partially resistant, and susceptible reactions at both 6 and 24 h after inoculation. Two additional libraries were constructed using uninoculated leaves and leaves from the lesion mimic mutant spl11. A total of 68,920 ESTs were generated from 8 libraries. Clustering and assembly analyses resulted in 13,570 unique sequences from 10,934 contigs and 2,636 singletons. Gene function classification showed that 42% of the ESTs were predicted to have putative gene function. Comparison of the pathogen-challenged libraries with the uninoculated control library revealed an increase in the percentage of genes in the functional categories of defense and signal transduction mechanisms and cell cycle control, cell division, and chromosome partitioning. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis grouped the eight libraries based on their disease reactions. A total of 7,748 new and unique ESTs were identified from our collection compared with the KOME full-length cDNA collection. Interestingly, we found that rice ESTs are more closely related to sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) ESTs than to barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays) ESTs.

The size of these introgressions is predicted by theoretical models but has rarely been measured in cultivated varieties. By combining resistance tests with isogenic strains, genotyping and sequencing of different rice accessions, it was shown that, in the elite rice variety IR64, the resistance conferring allele of the rice blast resistance gene Pi33 was introgressed from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon (accession IRGC101508). Further characterization of this introgression revealed a large introgression at this locus in IR64 and the related variety IR36. The introgressed fragment represents approximately half of the short arm of rice chromosome 8. This is the first report of a large introgression in a cultivated variety of rice. Such a large introgression is likely to have been maintained during backcrossing only if a selection pressure was exerted on this genomic region.

Rice blast is a devastating fungal disease worldwide. The use of blast resistance (R) genes is the most important approach to control the disease in rice breeding. In the present study, we finely mapped a novel resistance gene Pi65(t), conferring a broad-spectrum resistance to the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, using bulked segregant analysis in combination with next-generation sequencing technology. Segregation in a doubled haploid (DH) population and a BC1F2 population suggested that resistance to blast in Gangyu129 was likely conferred by a single dominant gene, designated Pi65(t); it was located on chromosome 11 from 30.20 to 31.20 Mb using next-generation sequencing. After screening recombinants with newly developed molecular markers, the region was narrowed down to 0.43 Mb, flanked by SNP-2 and SNP-8 at the physical location from 30.42 to 30.85 Mb based on the Nipponbare reference database in build 5. Using the software QTL IciMapping, Pi65(t) was further mapped to a locus between InDel-1 and SNP-4 with genetic distances of 0.11 and 0.98 cM, respectively. Within this region, 4 predicted R genes were found with nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains. We developed molecular markers to genotype 305 DH lines and found that InDel-1 was closely linked with Pi65(t). Using InDel-1, a new rice variety Chuangxin1 containing Pi65(t) was developed, and it is highly resistant to rice blast and produces a high yield in Liaoning province of China.

27454702,Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Rice Resistance Genes Against Magnaporthe oryzae Isolates from Four African Countries.,"Rice blast disease is emerging as a major constraint to rice production in Africa. Although a traditional gene-tagging strategy using biparental crosses can effectively identify resistance (R) genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) against Magnaporthe oryzae, the mapping procedure required is time consuming and requires many populations to investigate the genetics of resistance. In this report, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to rapidly map rice genes conferring resistance against eight M. oryzae isolates from four African countries. We inoculated 162 rice cultivars, which were part of the rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1) and were previously genotyped with the 44,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip, with the eight isolates. The GWAS identified 31 genomic regions associated with blast resistance (RABR) in the rice genome. In addition, we used polymerase chain reaction analysis to confirm the association between the Pish gene and a major RABR on chromosome 1 that was associated with resistance to four M. oryzae isolates. Our study has demonstrated the power of GWAS for the rapid identification of rice blast R or QTL genes that are effective against African populations of M. oryzae.

26772971,Several wall-associated kinases participate positively and negatively in basal defense against rice blast fungus.,"Receptor-like kinases are well-known to play key roles in disease resistance. Among them, the Wall-associated kinases (WAKs) have been shown to be positive regulators of fungal disease resistance in several plant species. WAK genes are often transcriptionally regulated during infection but the pathways involved in this regulation are not known. In rice, the OsWAK gene family is significantly amplified compared to Arabidopsis. The possibility that several WAKs participate in different ways to basal defense has not been addressed. Moreover, the direct requirement of rice OSWAK genes in regulating defense has not been explored. Here we show using rice (Oryza sativa) loss-of-function mutants of four selected OsWAK genes, that individual OsWAKs are required for quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. While OsWAK14, OsWAK91 and OsWAK92 positively regulate quantitative resistance, OsWAK112d is a negative regulator of blast resistance. In addition, we show that the very early transcriptional regulation of the rice OsWAK genes is triggered by chitin and is partially under the control of the chitin receptor CEBiP. Finally, we show that OsWAK91 is required for H2O2 production and sufficient to enhance defense gene expression during infection. We conclude that the rice OsWAK genes studied are part of basal defense response, potentially mediated by chitin from fungal cell walls. This work also shows that some OsWAKs, like OsWAK112d, may act as negative regulators of disease resistance.",receptorlike kinase wellknown play key role disease resistance among wallassociated kinase waks shown positive regulator fungal disease resistance several plant specie wak gene often transcriptionally regulated infection pathway involved regulation known rice oswak gene family significantly amplified compared arabidopsis possibility several waks participate different way basal defense addressed moreover direct requirement rice oswak gene regulating defense explored show using rice oryza sativa lossoffunction mutant four selected oswak gene individual oswaks required quantitative resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae oswak oswak oswak positively regulate quantitative resistance oswakd negative regulator blast resistance addition show early transcriptional regulation rice oswak gene triggered chitin partially control chitin receptor cebip finally show oswak required ho production sufficient enhance defense gene expression infection conclude rice oswak gene studied part basal defense response potentially mediated chitin fungal cell wall work also show oswaks like oswakd may act negative regulator disease resistance,0,"{'Disease': ['key role disease resistance', 'positive regulator fungal disease resistance', 'quantitative resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'negative regulator disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
11990510,A proteomics approach towards understanding blast fungus infection of rice grown under different levels of nitrogen fertilization.,"Proteins extracted from leaf blades of rice plants infected with blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and 63 proteins were analyzed by a gas-phase protein sequencer. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of 33 out of 63 proteins were determined in this manner. N-terminal regions of the remaining proteins could not be sequenced. The internal amino acid sequences of 12 proteins were determined by sequence analysis of peptides obtained by the Cleveland peptide mapping method. The amino acid sequences were compared with those of known plant and animal protein sequences to understand the nature of these proteins. As expected, leaf blades revealed predominantly the presence of photosynthetic proteins. Using this experimental approach named as proteome analysis, the functional proteins during blast fungus infection of rice with different levels of nitrogen nutrient were analyzed. Twelve proteins which appeared to change with different levels of nitrogen nutrient were identified. It was revealed that the level of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase was increased by top-dressing with nitrogen nutrient. Additionally, the pathogenesis related protein were observed following blast fungus infection using immunoblot analysis.

22267486,Effector-mediated suppression of chitin-triggered immunity by magnaporthe oryzae is necessary for rice blast disease.,"Plants use pattern recognition receptors to defend themselves from microbial pathogens. These receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate signaling pathways that lead to immunity. In rice (Oryza sativa), the chitin elicitor binding protein (CEBiP) recognizes chitin oligosaccharides released from the cell walls of fungal pathogens. Here, we show that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae overcomes this first line of plant defense by secreting an effector protein, Secreted LysM Protein1 (Slp1), during invasion of new rice cells. We demonstrate that Slp1 accumulates at the interface between the fungal cell wall and the rice plasma membrane, can bind to chitin, and is able to suppress chitin-induced plant immune responses, including generation of reactive oxygen species and plant defense gene expression. Furthermore, we show that Slp1 competes with CEBiP for binding of chitin oligosaccharides. Slp1 is required by M. oryzae for full virulence and exerts a significant effect on tissue invasion and disease lesion expansion. By contrast, gene silencing of CEBiP in rice allows M. oryzae to cause rice blast disease in the absence of Slp1. We propose that Slp1 sequesters chitin oligosaccharides to prevent PAMP-triggered immunity in rice, thereby facilitating rapid spread of the fungus within host tissue.",plant use pattern recognition receptor defend microbial pathogen receptor recognize pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamps activate signaling pathway lead immunity rice oryza sativa chitin elicitor binding protein cebip recognizes chitin oligosaccharide released cell wall fungal pathogen show rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae overcomes first line plant defense secreting effector protein secreted lysm protein slp invasion new rice cell demonstrate slp accumulates interface fungal cell wall rice plasma membrane bind chitin able suppress chitininduced plant immune response including generation reactive oxygen specie plant defense gene expression furthermore show slp competes cebip binding chitin oligosaccharide slp required oryzae full virulence exerts significant effect tissue invasion disease lesion expansion contrast gene silencing cebip rice allows oryzae cause rice blast disease absence slp propose slp sequesters chitin oligosaccharide prevent pamptriggered immunity rice thereby facilitating rapid spread fungus within host tissue,1,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'oryzae full virulence exerts significant effect tissue invasion disease lesion expansion contrast gene', 'rice blast disease absence slp', 'rapid spread fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['first line plant defense secreting effector protein', 'oryzae full virulence exerts significant effect tissue invasion disease lesion expansion contrast gene']}",7

The rice blm displayed spontaneous necrotic lesion formation on the leaves during development under long-day condition and temperature shift from 28 to 24 degrees C in the absence of obvious stress/disease, and provided us with a highly reproducible and convenient experimental system in the growth chamber to study blm. The blm phenotype resembled to the cell death of hypersensitive reaction (HR), and subsequent, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) revealed induction of many leaf proteins; prominent among them were the three pathogenesis-related (PR) marker proteins of class 5 (one spot) and 10 (two spots). Interestingly, the rice blm manifested HR against all races tested of the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), providing high resistance in a non-race specific manner. It was also observed that blm was highly resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment. Using 2-DGE immunoblotting, we identified the presence of 4 new spots cross-reacting with a superoxide dismutase (SOD) antibody, only in blm, suggesting the expression of potentially new SOD protein (isoforms) during lesion formation. In the leaves of blm, autofluorescent compounds accumulated in and around the site of lesion progression. Moreover, enhanced levels of two major rice phytoalexins, sakuranetin and momilactone A were also observed in the leaves of blm.

In our effort to identify more effective forms of this gene, we isolated an orthologue of Pi54 named as Pi54rh from the blast-resistant wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis, using allele mining approach and validated by complementation. The Pi54rh belongs to CC-NBS-LRR family of disease resistance genes with a unique Zinc finger (C(3)H type) domain.

19357089,Interaction transcriptome analysis identifies Magnaporthe oryzae BAS1-4 as Biotrophy-associated secreted proteins in rice blast disease.,"Biotrophic invasive hyphae (IH) of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae secrete effectors to alter host defenses and cellular processes as they successively invade living rice (Oryza sativa) cells. However, few blast effectors have been identified. Indeed, understanding fungal and rice genes contributing to biotrophic invasion has been difficult because so few plant cells have encountered IH at the earliest infection stages. We developed a robust procedure for isolating infected-rice sheath RNAs in which approximately 20% of the RNA originated from IH in first-invaded cells. We analyzed these IH RNAs relative to control mycelial RNAs using M. oryzae oligoarrays. With a 10-fold differential expression threshold, we identified known effector PWL2 and 58 candidate effectors. Four of these candidates were confirmed to be fungal biotrophy-associated secreted (BAS) proteins. Fluorescently labeled BAS proteins were secreted into rice cells in distinct patterns in compatible, but not in incompatible, interactions. BAS1 and BAS2 proteins preferentially accumulated in biotrophic interfacial complexes along with known avirulence effectors, BAS3 showed additional localization near cell wall crossing points, and BAS4 uniformly outlined growing IH.

However, the specific mechanisms by which different nitrogen forms influence rice blast pathogenesis remain poorly understood. This study used hydroponic assays to explore how ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) affect rice after inoculation with Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). The results showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, compared to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, significantly reduced disease severity, fungal growth, fungal hyphae number, the expansion capacity of infectious hyphae, and disease-related loss of photosynthesis. Additionally, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> enhanced the expression of defense-related genes, including OsPBZ1, OsCHT1, OsPR1a, and OsPR10. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-treated rice also exhibited higher hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulation and increased antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover, susceptibility to rice blast disease increased when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was scavenged, while a reduction in susceptibility was observed with the application of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

Young rice leaves in a resistant line exhibited hypersensitive reaction (HR) within 3 days post inoculation (dpi) of a spore suspension, and an increase in sakuranetin was detected at 3 dpi, increasing to 4-fold at 4 dpi. In the susceptible line, increased sakuranetin was detected at 4 dpi, but not at 3 dpi, by which a large fungus mass has accumulated without HR. Induced expression of a PA biosynthesis gene OsNOMT for naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase was found before accumulation of sakuranetin in both cultivars. The antifungal activity of sakuranetin was considerably higher than that of the major rice diterpenoid PA momilactone A in vitro and in vivo under similar experimental conditions. The decrease and detoxification of sakuranetin were detected in both solid and liquid mycelium cultures, and they took place slower than those of momilactone A.

Rice yield has been drastically reduced and severely affected by various biotic and abiotic stresses, especially pathogens. Controlling the attack of such pathogens is a matter of immediate concern as yield losses in rice crops could deprive millions of lives of nourishment worldwide. Pyricularia oryzae is one such pathogen that has been considered the major disease of rice because of its worldwide geographic distribution. P. oryzae belongs to the kingdom fungi, that causes rice blast ultimately adversely affecting the yield of the rice crop. Keeping in view this alarming scenario, the present study was designed so that the identifications of genome-encoded miRNAs of Oryza sativa were employed to target and silence the genome of P. oryzae. This study accomplished the computational analysis of algorithms related to miRNA target prediction. Four computational target prediction algorithms i.e., psRNATarget, RNA22, miRanda, and RNAhybrid were utilized in this investigation. The consensus among target prediction algorithms was created to discover six miRNAs from the O. sativa genome with the conservation of the target site fully evaluated on the genome of P. oryzae. The discovery of these novel six miRNAs in Oryza sativa paved a strong way toward the control of this disease in rice. It will open doors for further research in the field of gene silencing in rice. These miRNAs can be designed and employed in the future as experimentation to create constructs regarding the silencing of P. oryzae in rice crops.

In this paper, 12 Qc-SNARE genes were isolated from rice, and expression patterns of 9 genes were detected in various tissues and in seedlings challenged with oxidative stresses and inoculated with rice blast. The expression of OsSYP71 was clearly up-regulated under these stresses. Overexpression of OsSYP71 in rice showed more tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast than wild-type plants.

20858844,Tissue-adapted invasion strategies of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast, the most serious foliar fungal disease of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa). During hemibiotrophic leaf infection, the pathogen simultaneously combines biotrophic and necrotrophic growth. Here, we provide cytological and molecular evidence that, in contrast to leaf tissue infection, the fungus adopts a uniquely biotrophic infection strategy in roots for a prolonged period and spreads without causing a loss of host cell viability. Consistent with a biotrophic lifestyle, intracellularly growing hyphae of M. oryzae are surrounded by a plant-derived membrane. Global, temporal gene expression analysis used to monitor rice responses to progressive root infection revealed a rapid but transient induction of basal defense-related gene transcripts, indicating perception of the pathogen by the rice root. Early defense gene induction was followed by suppression at the onset of intracellular fungal growth, consistent with the biotrophic nature of root invasion. By contrast, during foliar infection, the vast majority of these transcripts continued to accumulate or increased in abundance. Furthermore, induction of necrotrophy-associated genes during early tissue penetration, previously observed in infected leaves, was not seen in roots. Collectively, our results not only report a global characterization of transcriptional root responses to a biotrophic fungal pathogen but also provide initial evidence for tissue-adapted fungal infection strategies.",magnaporthe oryzae cause rice blast serious foliar fungal disease cultivated rice oryza sativa hemibiotrophic leaf infection pathogen simultaneously combine biotrophic necrotrophic growth provide cytological molecular evidence contrast leaf tissue infection fungus adopts uniquely biotrophic infection strategy root prolonged period spread without causing loss host cell viability consistent biotrophic lifestyle intracellularly growing hypha oryzae surrounded plantderived membrane global temporal gene expression analysis used monitor rice response progressive root infection revealed rapid transient induction basal defenserelated gene transcript indicating perception pathogen rice root early defense gene induction followed suppression onset intracellular fungal growth consistent biotrophic nature root invasion contrast foliar infection vast majority transcript continued accumulate increased abundance furthermore induction necrotrophyassociated gene early tissue penetration previously observed infected leaf seen root collectively result report global characterization transcriptional root response biotrophic fungal pathogen also provide initial evidence tissueadapted fungal infection strategy,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast serious foliar fungal disease', 'cytological molecular evidence contrast leaf tissue infection fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
25515696,Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.,"Most agronomically important traits, including resistance against pathogens, are governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL). QTL-mediated resistance shows promise of being effective and long-lasting against diverse pathogens. Identification of genes controlling QTL-based disease resistance contributes to breeding for cultivars that exhibit high and stable resistance. Several defense response genes have been successfully used as good predictors and contributors to QTL-based resistance against several devastating rice diseases. In this study, we identified and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant line containing a 750 bp deletion in the second exon of OsPAL4, a member of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene family. OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2. Self-pollination of heterozygous ospal4 mutant lines produced no homozygous progeny, suggesting that homozygosity for the mutation is lethal. The heterozygous ospal4 mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility to three distinct rice diseases, bacterial blight, sheath blight, and rice blast. Mutation of OsPAL4 increased expression of the OsPAL2 gene and decreased the expression of the unlinked OsPAL6 gene. OsPAL2 function is not redundant because the changes in expression did not compensate for loss of disease resistance. OsPAL6 co-localizes with a QTL for rice blast resistance, and is down-regulated in the ospal4 mutant line; this may explain enhanced susceptibility to Magnoporthe oryzae. Overall, these results suggest that OsPAL4 and possibly OsPAL6 are key contributors to resistance governed by QTL and are potential breeding targets for improved broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.",agronomically important trait including resistance pathogen governed quantitative trait locus qtl qtlmediated resistance show promise effective longlasting diverse pathogen identification gene controlling qtlbased disease resistance contributes breeding cultivar exhibit high stable resistance several defense response gene successfully used good predictor contributor qtlbased resistance several devastating rice disease study identified characterized rice oryza sativa mutant line containing bp deletion second exon ospal member phenylalanine ammonialyase gene family ospal cluster three additional ospal gene colocalize qtl bacterial blight sheath blight disease resistance rice chromosome selfpollination heterozygous ospal mutant line produced homozygous progeny suggesting homozygosity mutation lethal heterozygous ospal mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility three distinct rice disease bacterial blight sheath blight rice blast mutation ospal increased expression ospal gene decreased expression unlinked ospal gene ospal function redundant change expression compensate loss disease resistance ospal colocalizes qtl rice blast resistance downregulated ospal mutant line may explain enhanced susceptibility magnoporthe oryzae overall result suggest ospal possibly ospal key contributor resistance governed qtl potential breeding target improved broadspectrum disease resistance rice,8,"{'Disease': ['qtlbased disease resistance', 'several devastating rice disease study', 'bacterial blight sheath blight disease resistance rice chromosome selfpollination heterozygous ospal mutant line', 'increased susceptibility three distinct rice disease bacterial blight sheath blight rice blast mutation ospal increased expression ospal gene', 'loss disease resistance ospal colocalizes', 'improved broadspectrum disease resistance rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective longlasting diverse pathogen identification gene']}",13
21075959,"Cyanide, a coproduct of plant hormone ethylene biosynthesis, contributes to the resistance of rice to blast fungus.","Rice (Oryza sativa) plants carrying the Pi-i resistance gene to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae restrict invaded fungus in infected tissue via hypersensitive reaction or response (HR), which is accompanied by rapid ethylene production and formation of small HR lesions. Ethylene biosynthesis has been implicated to be important for blast resistance; however, the individual roles of ethylene and cyanide, which are produced from the precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, remain unevaluated. In this study, we found that Pi-i-mediated resistance was compromised in transgenic rice lines, in which ethylene biosynthetic enzyme genes were silenced and then ethylene production was inhibited. The compromised resistance in transgenic lines was recovered by exogenously applying cyanide but not ethephon, an ethylene-releasing chemical in plant tissue. In a susceptible rice cultivar, treatment with cyanide or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid induced the resistance to blast fungus in a dose-dependent manner, while ethephon did not have the effect. Cyanide inhibited the growth of blast fungus in vitro and in planta, and application of flavonoids, secondary metabolites that exist ubiquitously in the plant kingdom, enhanced the cyanide-induced inhibition of fungal growth.

39254868,Current status of molecular rice breeding for durable and broad-spectrum resistance to major diseases and insect pests.,"In the past century, there have been great achievements in identifying resistance (R) genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) as well as revealing the corresponding molecular mechanisms for resistance in rice to major diseases and insect pests. The introgression of R genes to develop resistant rice cultivars has become the most effective and eco-friendly method to control pathogens/insects at present. However, little attention has been paid to durable and broad-spectrum resistance, which determines the real applicability of R genes. Here, we summarize all the R genes and QTLs conferring durable and broad-spectrum resistance in rice to fungal blast, bacterial leaf blight (BLB), and the brown planthopper (BPH) in molecular breeding. We discuss the molecular mechanisms and feasible methods of improving durable and broad-spectrum resistance to blast, BLB, and BPH. We will particularly focus on pyramiding multiple R genes or QTLs as the most useful method to improve durability and broaden the disease/insect spectrum in practical breeding regardless of its uncertainty.

18533827,A genome-wide meta-analysis of rice blast resistance genes and quantitative trait loci provides new insights into partial and complete resistance.,"The completion of the genome sequences of both rice and Magnaporthe oryzae has strengthened the position of rice blast disease as a model to study plant-pathogen interactions in monocotyledons. Genetic studies of blast resistance in rice were established in Japan as early as 1917. Despite such long-term study, examples of cultivars with durable resistance are rare, partly due to our limited knowledge of resistance mechanisms. A rising number of blast resistance genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been genetically described, and some have been characterized during the last 20 years. Using the rice genome sequence, can we now go a step further toward a better understanding of the genetics of blast resistance by combining all these results? Is such knowledge appropriate and sufficient to improve breeding for durable resistance? A review of bibliographic references identified 85 blast resistance genes and approximately 350 QTL, which we mapped on the rice genome.

21070413,Perception of the chitin oligosaccharides contributes to disease resistance to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.,"Chitin is a component of fungal cell walls, and its fragments act as elicitors in many plants. The plasma membrane glycoprotein CEBiP, which possesses LysM domains, is a receptor for the chitin elicitor (CE) in rice. Here, we report that the perception of CE by CEBiP contributes to disease resistance against the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and that enhanced responses to CE by engineering CEBiP increase disease tolerance. Knockdown of CEBiP expression allowed increased spread of the infection hyphae. To enhance defense responses to CE, we constructed chimeric genes composed of CEBiP and Xa21, which mediate resistance to rice bacterial leaf blight. The expression of either CRXa1 or CRXa3, each of which contains the whole extracellular portion of CEBiP, the whole intracellular domain of XA21, and the transmembrane domain from either CEBiP or XA21, induced cell death accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species after treatment with CE. Rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor exhibited necrotic lesions in response to CE and became more resistant to M. oryzae. Deletion of the first LysM domain in CRXA1 abolished these cellular responses. These results suggest that CEs are produced and recognized through the LysM domain of CEBiP during the interaction between rice and M. oryzae and imply that engineering pattern recognition receptors represents a new strategy for crop protection against fungal diseases.",chitin component fungal cell wall fragment act elicitors many plant plasma membrane glycoprotein cebip possesses lysm domain receptor chitin elicitor ce rice report perception ce cebip contributes disease resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae enhanced response ce engineering cebip increase disease tolerance knockdown cebip expression allowed increased spread infection hypha enhance defense response ce constructed chimeric gene composed cebip xa mediate resistance rice bacterial leaf blight expression either crxa crxa contains whole extracellular portion cebip whole intracellular domain xa transmembrane domain either cebip xa induced cell death accompanied increased production reactive oxygen nitrogen specie treatment ce rice plant expressing chimeric receptor exhibited necrotic lesion response ce became resistant oryzae deletion first lysm domain crxa abolished cellular response result suggest ce produced recognized lysm domain cebip interaction rice oryzae imply engineering pattern recognition receptor represents new strategy crop protection fungal disease,1,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe', 'oryzae enhanced response ce engineering cebip increase disease tolerance knockdown', 'new strategy crop protection fungal disease'], 'Treatment': ['increased production reactive oxygen nitrogen specie treatment ce rice plant'], 'Symptom': []}",7
20872132,Dissecting quantitative resistance against blast disease using heterogeneous inbred family lines in rice.,"SHZ-2 is an indica rice cultivar that exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast; it is widely used as a resistance donor in breeding programs. To dissect the QTL responsible for broad-spectrum blast resistance, we crossed SHZ-2 to TXZ-13, a blast susceptible indica variety, to produce 244 BC(4)F(3) lines. These lines were evaluated for blast resistance in greenhouse and field conditions. Chromosomal introgressions from SHZ-2 into the TXZ-13 genome were identified using a single feature polymorphism microarray, SSR markers and gene-specific primers. Segregation analysis of the BC(4)F(3) population indicated that three regions on chromosomes 2, 6, and 9, designated as qBR2.1, qBR6.1, and qBR9.1, respectively, was associated with blast resistance and contributed 16.2, 14.9, and 22.3%, respectively, to the phenotypic variance of diseased leaf area (DLA). We further narrowed the three QTL regions using pairs of sister lines extracted from heterogeneous inbred families (HIF). Pairwise comparison of these lines enabled the determination of the relative contributions of individual QTL. The qBR9.1 conferred strong resistance, whereas qBR2.1 or qBR6.1 individually did not reduce disease under field conditions. However, when qBR2.1 and qBR6.1 were combined, they reduced disease by 19.5%, suggesting that small effect QTLs contribute to reduction of epidemics. The qBR6.1 and qBR9.1 regions contain nucleotide-binding sites and leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRR) sequences, whereas the qBR2.1 did not. In the qBR6.1 region, the patterns of expression of adjacent NBS-LRR genes were consistent in backcross generations and correlated with blast resistance, supporting the hypothesis that multiple resistance genes within a QTL region can contribute to non-race-specific quantitative resistance.",shz indica rice cultivar exhibit broadspectrum resistance rice blast widely used resistance donor breeding program dissect qtl responsible broadspectrum blast resistance crossed shz txz blast susceptible indica variety produce bcf line line evaluated blast resistance greenhouse field condition chromosomal introgressions shz txz genome identified using single feature polymorphism microarray ssr marker genespecific primer segregation analysis bcf population indicated three region chromosome designated qbr qbr qbr respectively associated blast resistance contributed respectively phenotypic variance diseased leaf area dla narrowed three qtl region using pair sister line extracted heterogeneous inbred family hif pairwise comparison line enabled determination relative contribution individual qtl qbr conferred strong resistance whereas qbr qbr individually reduce disease field condition however qbr qbr combined reduced disease suggesting small effect qtls contribute reduction epidemic qbr qbr region contain nucleotidebinding site leucine rich repeat nbslrr sequence whereas qbr qbr region pattern expression adjacent nbslrr gene consistent backcross generation correlated blast resistance supporting hypothesis multiple resistance gene within qtl region contribute nonracespecific quantitative resistance,2,"{'Disease': ['respectively phenotypic variance diseased leaf area dla', 'disease field condition', 'however qbr qbr combined reduced disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['small effect qtls contribute reduction epidemic qbr qbr region']}",5

20626286,Identification of the quantitative trait loci in japonica rice landrace Heikezijing responsible for broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast.,"Rice blast is one of the most devastating diseases affecting rice production worldwide. One japonica landrace, Heikezijing, from the Taihu Lake area in China, has been reported to be highly resistant to most of the rice blast isolates collected from China and Japan. To effectively dissect the inheritance of its resistance, a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (F(2:8)) was constructed from a cross between Heikezijing and Suyunuo, a blast-susceptible cultivar. Nineteen blast isolates from China and Japan were inoculated into 166 RILs and their parents, and 22 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring resistance to these isolates were identified and mapped onto rice chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 11, and 12. Most of the QTLs conferred race-specific resistance to blast. Some QTLs, such as qtl11-5-5, conferred resistance to two or more isolates.

12111554,"Two broad-spectrum blast resistance genes, Pi9( t) and Pi2( t), are physically linked on rice chromosome 6.","To understand the molecular basis of broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, fine-scale mapping of the two blast resistance (R) genes, Pi9( t) and Pi2( t), was conducted. These two genes were introgressed from different resistance donors, previously reported to confer resistance to many blast isolates in the Philippines, and were mapped to an approximately 10-cM interval on chromosome 6. To further test their resistance spectrum, 43 blast isolates collected from 13 countries were used to inoculate the Pi2( t) and Pi9( t) plants. Pi9( t)-bearing lines were highly resistant to all isolates tested, and lines carrying Pi2( t) were resistant to 36 isolates, confirming the broad-spectrum resistance of these two genes to diverse blast isolates. Three RAPD markers tightly linked to Pi9( t) were identified using the bulk segregant analysis technique. Twelve positive bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were identified and a BAC contig covering about 100 kb was constructed when the Pi9( t) BAC library was screened with one of the markers. A high-resolution map of Pi9( t) was constructed using BAC ends. The Pi2( t) gene was tightly linked to all of the Pi9( t) markers in 450 F(2) plants. These data suggest that Pi9( t) and Pi2( t) are either allelic or tightly linked in an approximately 100-kb region. The mapping results for Pi9( t) and Pi2( t) provide essential information for the positional cloning of these two important blast resistance genes in rice.",understand molecular basis broadspectrum resistance rice blast finescale mapping two blast resistance r gene pi pi conducted two gene introgressed different resistance donor previously reported confer resistance many blast isolates philippine mapped approximately cm interval chromosome test resistance spectrum blast isolates collected country used inoculate pi pi plant pi tbearing line highly resistant isolates tested line carrying pi resistant isolates confirming broadspectrum resistance two gene diverse blast isolates three rapd marker tightly linked pi identified using bulk segregant analysis technique twelve positive bacterial artificial chromosome bac clone identified bac contig covering kb constructed pi bac library screened one marker highresolution map pi constructed using bac end pi gene tightly linked pi marker f plant data suggest pi pi either allelic tightly linked approximately kb region mapping result pi pi provide essential information positional cloning two important blast resistance gene rice,10,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
38834685,The unconventional resistance protein PTR recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pita in an allele-specific manner.,"Blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating rice diseases. Disease resistance genes such as Pi-ta or Pi-ta2 are critical in protecting rice production from blast. Published work reports that Pi-ta codes for a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain protein (NLR) that recognizes the fungal protease-like effector AVR-Pita by direct binding. However, this model was challenged by the recent discovery that Pi-ta2 resistance, which also relies on AVR-Pita detection, is conferred by the unconventional resistance gene Ptr, which codes for a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic armadillo repeat domain. Here, using NLR Pi-ta and Ptr RNAi knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutant rice lines, we found that AVR-Pita recognition relies solely on Ptr and that the NLR Pi-ta has no role in it, indicating that it is not the Pi-ta resistance gene. Different alleles of Ptr confer different recognition specificities. The A allele of Ptr (PtrA) detects all natural sequence variants of the effector and confers Pi-ta2 resistance, while the B allele of Ptr (PtrB) recognizes a restricted set of AVR-Pita alleles and, thereby, confers Pi-ta resistance. Analysis of the natural diversity in AVR-Pita and of mutant and transgenic strains identified one specific polymorphism in the effector sequence that controls escape from PtrB-mediated resistance. Taken together, our work establishes that the M. oryzae effector AVR-Pita is detected in an allele-specific manner by the unconventional rice resistance protein Ptr and that the NLR Pi-ta has no function in Pi-ta resistance and the recognition of AVR-Pita.",blast disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating rice disease disease resistance gene pita pita critical protecting rice production blast published work report pita code nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat domain protein nlr recognizes fungal proteaselike effector avrpita direct binding however model challenged recent discovery pita resistance also relies avrpita detection conferred unconventional resistance gene ptr code membrane protein cytoplasmic armadillo repeat domain using nlr pita ptr rnai knockdown crisprcas knockout mutant rice line found avrpita recognition relies solely ptr nlr pita role indicating pita resistance gene different allele ptr confer different recognition specificity allele ptr ptra detects natural sequence variant effector confers pita resistance b allele ptr ptrb recognizes restricted set avrpita allele thereby confers pita resistance analysis natural diversity avrpita mutant transgenic strain identified one specific polymorphism effector sequence control escape ptrbmediated resistance taken together work establishes oryzae effector avrpita detected allelespecific manner unconventional rice resistance protein ptr nlr pita function pita resistance recognition avrpita,13,"{'Disease': ['blast disease', 'fungus magnaporthe', 'one devastating rice disease disease resistance gene pita pita critical protecting rice production blast'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['fungal proteaselike effector avrpita direct binding however model', 'different recognition specificity allele ptr ptra detects natural sequence variant effector confers pita resistance b allele ptr ptrb', 'one specific polymorphism effector sequence control escape ptrbmediated resistance', 'oryzae effector avrpita']}",5
21251109,A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes.,"The Oryza sativa (rice) resistance gene Pia confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae carrying the AVR-Pia avirulence gene. To clone Pia, we employed a multifaceted genomics approach. First, we selected 12 R-gene analog (RGA) genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRRs) proteins from a region on chromosome 11 that shows linkage to Pia. By using seven rice accessions, we examined the association between Pia phenotypes and DNA polymorphisms in the 10 genes, which revealed three genes (Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5) exhibiting a perfect association with the Pia phenotypes. We also screened ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treated mutant lines of the rice cultivar 'Sasanishiki' harboring Pia, and isolated two mutants that lost the Pia phenotype. DNA sequencing of Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5 from the two mutant lines identified independent mutations of major effects in Os11gRGA4. The wild-type 'Sasanishiki' allele of Os11gRGA4 (SasRGA4) complemented Pia function in both mutants, suggesting that SasRGA4 is necessary for Pia function. However, when the rice cultivar 'Himenomochi' lacking Pia was transfected with SasRGA4, the Pia phenotype was not recovered. An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS-LRR-type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function. A population genetics analysis of SasRGA4 and SasRGA5 suggests that the two genes are under long-term balancing selection.",oryza sativa rice resistance gene pia confers resistance blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae carrying avrpia avirulence gene clone pia employed multifaceted genomics approach first selected rgene analog rga gene encoding nucleotide binding siteleucine rich repeat nbslrrs protein region chromosome show linkage pia using seven rice accession examined association pia phenotype dna polymorphism gene revealed three gene osgrgaosgrga exhibiting perfect association pia phenotype also screened ethyl methane sulfonate emstreated mutant line rice cultivar sasanishiki harboring pia isolated two mutant lost pia phenotype dna sequencing osgrgaosgrga two mutant line identified independent mutation major effect osgrga wildtype sasanishiki allele osgrga sasrga complemented pia function mutant suggesting sasrga necessary pia function however rice cultivar himenomochi lacking pia transfected sasrga pia phenotype recovered additional complementation study revealed two nbslrrtype r gene sasrga sasrga located next oriented opposite direction necessary pia function population genetics analysis sasrga sasrga suggests two gene longterm balancing selection,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['independent mutation major effect osgrga wildtype sasanishiki allele osgrga']}",5

To derive sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs) from OPF6(2700) and OPH18(2400), these amplified RAPD products were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence information, obtained for each end of the two linked RAPD markers, was used to design 24-mer oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of the respective SCARs. Polymorphisms appearing as differences in the length of the SCAR's alternate alleles were considered for the indirect selection of Pi-10. Such polymorphisms converted the linked dominant RAPD loci into codominant SCAR markers and also facilitated the indirect scoring of the blast-resistant and blast-susceptible genotypes. The development of length variant codominant SCAR markers linked to a major gene for blast resistance in rice is described.

20707904,Unique features of the rice blast resistance Pish locus revealed by large scale retrotransposon-tagging.,"R gene-mediated resistance is one of the most effective mechanisms of immunity against pathogens in plants. To date some components that regulate the primary steps of plant immunity have been isolated, however, the molecular dissection of defense signaling downstream of the R proteins remains to be completed. In addition, R genes are known to be highly variable, however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this variability remain obscure. To identify novel factors required for R gene-mediated resistance in rice, we used rice insertional mutant lines, induced by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, in a genetic screening involving the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We inoculated 41,119 mutant lines with the fungus using a high throughput procedure, and identified 86 mutant lines with diminished resistance. A genome analysis revealed that 72 of the 86 lines contained mutations in a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain-containing (NBS-LRR) protein. A genetic complementation analysis and a pathogenesis assay demonstrated that this NBS-LRR gene encodes Pish, which confers resistance against races of M. oryzae containing avrPish. The other 14 lines have intact copies of the Pish gene, suggesting that they may contain mutations in the signaling components downstream of Pish. The genome analysis indicated that Pish and its neighboring three NBS-LRR genes are high similar to one another and are tandemly located. An in silico analysis of a Tos17 flanking sequence database revealed that this region is a ""hot spot"" for insertion. Intriguingly, the insertion sites are not distributed evenly among these four NBS-LRR genes, despite their similarity at the sequence and expression levels. In this work we isolated the R gene Pish, and identified several other mutants involved in the signal transduction required for Pish-mediated resistance. These results indicate that our genetic approach is efficient and useful for unveiling novel aspects of defense signaling in rice. Furthermore, our data provide experimental evidence that R gene clusters have the potential to be highly preferred targets for transposable element insertions in plant genomes. Based on this finding, a possible mechanism underlying the high variability of R genes is discussed.",r genemediated resistance one effective mechanism immunity pathogen plant date component regulate primary step plant immunity isolated however molecular dissection defense signaling downstream r protein remains completed addition r gene known highly variable however molecular mechanism responsible variability remain obscure identify novel factor required r genemediated resistance rice used rice insertional mutant line induced endogenous retrotransposon tos genetic screening involving rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae inoculated mutant line fungus using high throughput procedure identified mutant line diminished resistance genome analysis revealed line contained mutation gene encoding nucleotide binding site nb leucine rich repeat lrr domaincontaining nbslrr protein genetic complementation analysis pathogenesis assay demonstrated nbslrr gene encodes pish confers resistance race oryzae containing avrpish line intact copy pish gene suggesting may contain mutation signaling component downstream pish genome analysis indicated pish neighboring three nbslrr gene high similar one another tandemly located silico analysis tos flanking sequence database revealed region hot spot insertion intriguingly insertion site distributed evenly among four nbslrr gene despite similarity sequence expression level work isolated r gene pish identified several mutant involved signal transduction required pishmediated resistance result indicate genetic approach efficient useful unveiling novel aspect defense signaling rice furthermore data provide experimental evidence r gene cluster potential highly preferred target transposable element insertion plant genome based finding possible mechanism underlying high variability r gene discussed,8,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'mutant line fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['one effective mechanism immunity pathogen plant date component']}",5
28168930,Avirulence (AVR) Gene-Based Diagnosis Complements Existing Pathogen Surveillance Tools for Effective Deployment of Resistance (R) Genes Against Rice Blast Disease.,"Avirulence (AVR) genes in Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungal pathogen that causes the devastating rice blast disease, have been documented to be major targets subject to mutations to avoid recognition by resistance (R) genes. In this study, an AVR-gene-based diagnosis tool for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population was developed and validated. A set of 77 single-spore field isolates was subjected to pathotype analysis using differential lines, each containing a single R gene, and classified into 20 virulent pathotypes, except for 4 isolates that lost pathogenicity. In all, 10 differential lines showed low frequency (<24%) of resistance whereas 8 lines showed a high frequency (>95%), inferring the effectiveness of R genes present in the respective differential lines. In addition, the haplotypes of seven AVR genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing, if applicable. The calculated frequency of different AVR genes displayed significant variations in the population. AVRPiz-t and AVR-Pii were detected in 100 and 84.9% of the isolates, respectively. Five AVR genes such as AVR-Pik-D (20.5%) and AVR-Pik-E (1.4%), AVRPiz-t (2.7%), AVR-Pita (0%), AVR-Pia (0%), and AVR1-CO39 (0%) displayed low or even zero frequency. The frequency of AVR genes correlated almost perfectly with the resistance frequency of the cognate R genes in differential lines, except for International Rice Research Institute-bred blast-resistant lines IRBLzt-T, IRBLta-K1, and IRBLkp-K60. Both genetic analysis and molecular marker validation revealed an additional R gene, most likely Pi19 or its allele, in these three differential lines. This can explain the spuriously higher resistance frequency of each target R gene based on conventional pathotyping. This study demonstrates that AVR-gene-based diagnosis provides a precise, R-gene-specific, and differential line-free assessment method that can be used for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population and for predicting the effectiveness of target R genes in rice varieties.",avirulence avr gene magnaporthe oryzae fungal pathogen cause devastating rice blast disease documented major target subject mutation avoid recognition resistance r gene study avrgenebased diagnosis tool determining virulence spectrum rice blast pathogen population developed validated set singlespore field isolates subjected pathotype analysis using differential line containing single r gene classified virulent pathotypes except isolates lost pathogenicity differential line showed low frequency resistance whereas line showed high frequency inferring effectiveness r gene present respective differential line addition haplotype seven avr gene determined polymerase chain reaction amplification sequencing applicable calculated frequency different avr gene displayed significant variation population avrpizt avrpii detected isolates respectively five avr gene avrpikd avrpike avrpizt avrpita avrpia avrco displayed low even zero frequency frequency avr gene correlated almost perfectly resistance frequency cognate r gene differential line except international rice research institutebred blastresistant line irblztt irbltak irblkpk genetic analysis molecular marker validation revealed additional r gene likely pi allele three differential line explain spuriously higher resistance frequency target r gene based conventional pathotyping study demonstrates avrgenebased diagnosis provides precise rgenespecific differential linefree assessment method used determining virulence spectrum rice blast pathogen population predicting effectiveness target r gene rice variety,9,"{'Disease': ['devastating rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': ['precise rgenespecific differential linefree assessment method'], 'Symptom': ['high frequency inferring effectiveness r gene present respective differential line addition', 'effectiveness target r gene rice variety']}",5

25188286,Evidence for a transketolase-mediated metabolic checkpoint governing biotrophic growth in rice cells by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae threatens global food security through the widespread destruction of cultivated rice. Foliar infection requires a specialized cell called an appressorium that generates turgor to force a thin penetration hypha through the rice cuticle and into the underlying epidermal cells, where the fungus grows for the first days of infection as a symptomless biotroph. Understanding what controls biotrophic growth could open new avenues for developing sustainable blast intervention programs. Here, using molecular genetics and live-cell imaging, we dismantled M. oryzae glucose-metabolizing pathways to reveal that the transketolase enzyme, encoded by TKL1, plays an essential role in facilitating host colonization during rice blast disease. In the absence of transketolase, Δtkl1 mutant strains formed functional appressoria that penetrated rice cuticles successfully and developed invasive hyphae (IH) in rice cells from primary hyphae. However, Δtkl1 could not undertake sustained biotrophic growth or cell-to-cell movement. Transcript data and observations using fluorescently labeled histone H1:RFP fusion proteins indicated Δtkl1 mutant strains were alive in host cells but were delayed in mitosis. Mitotic delay could be reversed and IH growth restored by the addition of exogenous ATP, a metabolite depleted in Δtkl1 mutant strains. We show that ATP might act via the TOR signaling pathway, and TOR is likely a downstream target of activation for TKL1. TKL1 is also involved in controlling the migration of appressorial nuclei into primary hyphae in host cells. When taken together, our results indicate transketolase has a novel role in mediating--via ATP and TOR signaling--an in planta-specific metabolic checkpoint that controls nuclear migration from appressoria into primary hyphae, prevents mitotic delay in early IH and promotes biotrophic growth. This work thus provides new information about the metabolic strategies employed by M. oryzae to enable rice cell colonization.",blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae threatens global food security widespread destruction cultivated rice foliar infection requires specialized cell called appressorium generates turgor force thin penetration hypha rice cuticle underlying epidermal cell fungus grows first day infection symptomless biotroph understanding control biotrophic growth could open new avenue developing sustainable blast intervention program using molecular genetics livecell imaging dismantled oryzae glucosemetabolizing pathway reveal transketolase enzyme encoded tkl play essential role facilitating host colonization rice blast disease absence transketolase δtkl mutant strain formed functional appressoria penetrated rice cuticle successfully developed invasive hypha ih rice cell primary hypha however δtkl could undertake sustained biotrophic growth celltocell movement transcript data observation using fluorescently labeled histone hrfp fusion protein indicated δtkl mutant strain alive host cell delayed mitosis mitotic delay could reversed ih growth restored addition exogenous atp metabolite depleted δtkl mutant strain show atp might act via tor signaling pathway tor likely downstream target activation tkl tkl also involved controlling migration appressorial nucleus primary hypha host cell taken together result indicate transketolase novel role mediatingvia atp tor signalingan plantaspecific metabolic checkpoint control nuclear migration appressoria primary hypha prevents mitotic delay early ih promotes biotrophic growth work thus provides new information metabolic strategy employed oryzae enable rice cell colonization,3,"{'Disease': ['blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'epidermal cell fungus', 'host colonization rice blast disease absence transketolase δtkl mutant strain'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['first day infection symptomless biotroph understanding control biotrophic growth']}",9
19203276,The pi40 gene for durable resistance to rice blast and molecular analysis of pi40-advanced backcross breeding lines.,"Rice blast severely reduces production in both irrigated and water-stressed upland ecosystems of tropical and temperate countries. Nearly 50 blast resistance genes have been identified and some of those are incorporated into several rice cultivars. However, most of the resistance genes break down in a few years because of their race specificity and the rapid change in pathogenicity of the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). The objective of this study was to analyze advanced backcross breeding lines (ABL) possessing the gene Pi40 for durable rice blast resistance. In all, 4 resistant genotypes, 4 japonica cultivars, and 10 monogenic differential rice genotypes with some known resistance genes were bioassayed in the greenhouse using seven sequential plantings and 29 virulent M. grisea isolates of Korea. The genotypes with the Pi40 gene had <3% diseased leaf area, which was significantly below the disease threshold level of 40% considered for durable blast resistance. Moreover, the genotypes with the Pi40 gene expressed compatibility with only two to three virulent M. grisea isolates supporting durability of resistance, in contrast to susceptible cultivars with >50% diseased leaf area and 10 compatible isolates. Of the 10 known resistance genes tested, Piz-t, Piz-5, and Pi9 showed differential reactions to the pathogen isolates in seven plantings. Genotyping of the ABL with 260 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed rapid conversion toward recurrent parent genotypes with fewer donor chromosomal segments (5.3 to 14.5%).

9291958,Alien introgression in rice.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity is affected by several biotic and abiotic stresses. The genetic variability for some of these stresses is limited in the cultivated rice germplasm. Moreover, changes in insect biotypes and disease races are a continuing threat to increased rice production. There is thus an urgent need to broaden the rice gene pool by introgressing genes for such traits from diverse sources. The wild species of Oryza representing AA, BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG and HHJJ genomes are an important reservoir of useful genes. However, low crossability and limited recombination between chromosomes of cultivated and wild species limit the transfer of such genes. AT IRRI, a series of hybrids and monosomic alien addition lines have been produced through embryo rescue following hybridization between rice and several distantly related species. Cytoplasmic male sterility and genes for resistance to grassy stunt virus and bacterial blight have been transferred from A genome wild species into rice. Similarly, genes for resistance to brown planthopper, bacterial blight and blast have also been introgressed across crossability barriers from distanly related species into rice. Some of the introgressed genes have been mapped via linkage to molecular markers. One of the genes Xa-21 introgressed from O. longistaminata has been cloned and physically mapped on chromosome 11 of rice using BAC library and flourescence in-situ hybridization. RFLP analysis revealed introgression from 11 of the 12 chromosomes of C genome species into rice. Introgression has also been obtained from other distant genomes (EE, FF, GG) into rice and in majority of the cases one or two RFLP markers were introgressed. Reciprocal replacement of RFLP alleles of wild species with the alleles of O. sativa indicates alien gene transfer through crossing over. The rapid recovery of recurrent phenotypes in BC2 and BC3 generations from wide crosses is an indication of limited recombination.

27050577,Identification of a Pi9-Containing Rice Germplasm with a Newly Developed Robust Marker.,"The Pi9 gene in rice, originating from Oryza minuta, is an effective resistance gene for controlling rice blast disease. However, currently available linked DNA markers do not accurately identify the function of Pi9, thus hindering its efficient incorporation into new cultivars through marker-assisted selection (MAS). In addition, no known Pi9-containing rice germplasm is available to breeders. In the present study, DNA sequence variation of Pi9 alleles and their family members was analyzed in 40 diverse rice germplasm accessions from the AA genome to develop a robust Pi9 marker. In total, 29 DNA primers of 20 to 23 nucleotides were designed and each possible combination of primer pairs was used to detect Pi9. Only one combination of DNA primers, KS28/KS6, was identified to specifically detect Pi9 in the monogenic line IRBL9-W. The presence of Pi9 was verified with the predicted Pi9-specific blast reaction. Subsequently, 201 genetically diverse mini-core rice accessions from 114 countries were screened with KS28/KS6.

10939258,Characterizing rice lesion mimic mutants and identifying a mutant with broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight.,"Many plant mutants develop spontaneous lesions that resemble disease symptoms in the absence of pathogen attack. In several pathosystems, lesion mimic mutations have been shown to be involved in programmed cell death, which in some instances leads to enhanced disease resistance to multiple pathogens. We investigated the relationship between spontaneous cell death and disease resistance in rice with nine mutants with a range of lesion mimic phenotypes. All nine mutations are controlled by recessive genes and some of these mutants have stunted growth and other abnormal characteristics. The lesion mimics that appeared on the leaves of these mutants were caused by cell death as measured by trypan blue staining. Activation of six defense-related genes was observed in most of the mutants when the mimic lesions developed. Four mutants exhibited significant enhanced resistance to rice blast. One of the mutants, spl11, confers non-race-specific resistance not only to blast but also to bacterial blight. The level of resistance in the spl11 mutant to the two pathogens correlates with the defense-related gene expression and lesion development on the leaves. The results suggest that some lesion mimic mutations in rice may be involved in disease resistance, and cloning of these genes may provide a clue to developing broad-spectrum resistance to diverse pathogens.",many plant mutant develop spontaneous lesion resemble disease symptom absence pathogen attack several pathosystems lesion mimic mutation shown involved programmed cell death instance lead enhanced disease resistance multiple pathogen investigated relationship spontaneous cell death disease resistance rice nine mutant range lesion mimic phenotype nine mutation controlled recessive gene mutant stunted growth abnormal characteristic lesion mimic appeared leaf mutant caused cell death measured trypan blue staining activation six defenserelated gene observed mutant mimic lesion developed four mutant exhibited significant enhanced resistance rice blast one mutant spl confers nonracespecific resistance blast also bacterial blight level resistance spl mutant two pathogen correlate defenserelated gene expression lesion development leaf result suggest lesion mimic mutation rice may involved disease resistance cloning gene may provide clue developing broadspectrum resistance diverse pathogen,8,"{'Disease': ['enhanced disease resistance multiple pathogen', 'relationship spontaneous cell death disease resistance', 'disease resistance cloning gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10
21373980,Characterization and fine mapping of the rice blast resistance gene Pia.,"Blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most widespread and destructive diseases of rice. Breeding durable resistant cultivars (cvs) can be achieved by pyramiding of various resistance (R) genes. Pia, carried by cv. Aichi Asahi, was evaluated against 612 isolates of M. oryzae collected from 10 Chinese provinces. The Pia gene expresses weak resistance in all the provinces except for Jiangsu. Genomic position-ready marker-based linkage analysis was carried out in a mapping population consisting of 800 F(2) plants derived from a cross of Aichi Asahi×Kasalath. The locus was defined in an interval of approximately 90 kb, flanked by markers A16 and A21. Four candidate genes (Pia-1, Pia-2, Pia-3, and Pia-4), all having the R gene conserved structure, were predicted in the interval using the cv. Nipponbare genomic sequence. Four candidate resistance gene (CRG) markers (A17, A25, A26, and A27), derived from the four candidates, were subjected to genotyping with the recombinants detected at the flanking markers. The first three markers completely co-segregated with the Pia locus, and the fourth was absent in the Aichi Asahi genome and disordered with the Pia locus and its flanking markers, indicating that the fourth candidate gene, Pia-4, could be excluded. Co-segregation marker-based genotyping of the three sets of differentials with known R gene genotypes revealed that the genotype of A26 (Pia-3) perfectly matched the R gene genotype of Pia, indicating that Pia-3 is the strongest candidate gene for Pia.",blast caused magnaporthe oryzae one widespread destructive disease rice breeding durable resistant cultivar cv achieved pyramiding various resistance r gene pia carried cv aichi asahi evaluated isolates oryzae collected chinese province pia gene express weak resistance province except jiangsu genomic positionready markerbased linkage analysis carried mapping population consisting f plant derived cross aichi asahi×kasalath locus defined interval approximately kb flanked marker four candidate gene pia pia pia pia r gene conserved structure predicted interval using cv nipponbare genomic sequence four candidate resistance gene crg marker derived four candidate subjected genotyping recombinant detected flanking marker first three marker completely cosegregated pia locus fourth absent aichi asahi genome disordered pia locus flanking marker indicating fourth candidate gene pia could excluded cosegregation markerbased genotyping three set differential known r gene genotype revealed genotype pia perfectly matched r gene genotype pia indicating pia strongest candidate gene pia,2,"{'Disease': ['one widespread destructive disease rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

However, few QTLs have been validated in progeny testing, on account of their small phenotypic effects. To understand the genetic basis for QTL-mediated resistance to blast, we dissected a resistance QTL, qBR4-2, using advanced backcross progeny derived from a chromosome segment substitution line in which a 30- to 34-Mb region of chromosome 4 from the resistant cultivar Owarihatamochi was substituted into the genetic background of the highly susceptible Aichiasahi. The analysis resolved qBR4-2 into three loci, designated qBR4-2a, qBR4-2b, and qBR4-2c. The sequences of qBR4-2a and qBR4-2b, which lie 181 kb apart from each other and measure, 113 and 32 kb, respectively, appear to encode proteins with a putative nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Sequence analysis of the donor allele of qBR4-2a, the region with the largest effect among the three, revealed sequence variations in the NBS-LRR region. The effect of qBR4-2c was smallest among the three, but its combination with the donor alleles of qBR4-2a and qBR4-2b significantly enhanced blast resistance. qBR4-2 comprises three tightly linked QTLs that control blast resistance in a complex manner, and thus gene pyramiding or haplotype selection is the recommended strategy for improving QTL-mediated resistance to blast disease through the use of this chromosomal region.",quantitative trait locus qtls resistance rice blast offer potential source durable disease resistance rice however qtls validated progeny testing account small phenotypic effect understand genetic basis qtlmediated resistance blast dissected resistance qtl qbr using advanced backcross progeny derived chromosome segment substitution line mb region chromosome resistant cultivar owarihatamochi substituted genetic background highly susceptible aichiasahi analysis resolved qbr three locus designated qbra qbrb qbrc sequence qbra qbrb lie kb apart measure kb respectively appear encode protein putative nucleotidebinding site nb leucinerich repeat lrrs sequence analysis donor allele qbra region largest effect among three revealed sequence variation nbslrr region effect qbrc smallest among three combination donor allele qbra qbrb significantly enhanced blast resistance qbr comprises three tightly linked qtls control blast resistance complex manner thus gene pyramiding haplotype selection recommended strategy improving qtlmediated resistance blast disease use chromosomal region,2,"{'Disease': ['potential source durable disease resistance rice', 'qtlmediated resistance blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['account small phenotypic effect', 'largest effect', 'three revealed sequence variation nbslrr region effect qbrc']}",5

34931899,Morphological and Molecular Analysis of Fungal Species Associated with Blast and Brown Spot Diseases of <i>Oryza sativa</i>.,"Fungal diseases blast and brown spot in rice cause severe yield losses worldwide. Blast is caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, and <i>Bipolaris oryzae</i> is reported as the main causal organism of brown spot. Both diseases cause leaf lesions that are difficult differentiate until the later stages. Early detection and differentiation of the lesions would help the adoption of disease management strategies specific to the pathogens and prevent reductions in the quality and quantity of rice yields. This study was conducted in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka over five consecutive rice cultivating seasons to characterize the causal fungi of rice blast and brown spot diseases by morphological and molecular means and to develop a visual guide to differentiate the two diseases. Disease incidence was recorded in 114 fields from 2017 to 2019, and fungal isolates associated with the lesions of both diseases were cultured and subjected to morphological and molecular characterization. Competitive growth interactions between <i>M. oryzae</i> and the more common individual fungal isolates of the brown spot lesions were evaluated. Fungal metagenomic analysis was conducted for the fungal species isolated from brown spot lesions. A suppression of blast accompanied by an increased incidence of brown spot disease was observed during the study period. <i>M. oryzae</i> was confirmed to be the causal organism of the blast, and >20 species of fungi were identified to be associated with brown spot lesions through morphological and molecular studies and metagenomic analyses. Fungal internal transcribed spacer region sequencing revealed genetic variation in the highly conserved region of DNA sequences of blast and brown spot fungal isolates. <i>B. oryzae</i>, <i>Curvularia</i>, and <i>Microdochium</i> species were commonly isolated from brown spot lesions. In vitro competitive growth interactions between the fungal isolates revealed growth suppression of <i>M. oryzae</i> by the fungal isolates associated with brown spot lesions.

27000073,Live-cell fluorescence imaging to investigate the dynamics of plant cell death during infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Plant cell death plays important roles during plant-pathogen interactions. To study pathogen-induced cell death, there is a need for cytological tools that allow determining not only host cell viability, but also cellular events leading to cell death with visualization of pathogen development. Here we describe a live cell imaging method to provide insights into the dynamics of cell death in rice (Oryza sativa). This method uses live-cell confocal microscopy of rice sheath cells mechanically damaged or invaded by fluorescently-tagged Magnaporthe oryzae together with fluorescent dyes fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI). FDA stains the cytoplasm of live cells exclusively, thus also visualizing the vacuole, whereas PI stains nuclei of dead cells. We first demonstrated that confocal microscopy of rice leaf sheaths stained with FDA and PI discriminated between live cells and mechanically-killed cells. FDA-derived fluorescein was confined to the cytoplasm of live cells, indicating the intact vacuolar and plasma membranes. We also observed previously unreported fluorescein patterns in mechanically damaged cells. These patterns include: (1) homogeneous distribution of fluorescein in the increased area of the cytoplasm due to the shrunken vacuole; (2) the increase of the fluorescein intensity; and (3) containment of the brighter fluorescein signal only in affected cells likely due to closure of plasmodesmata. We refer to these as novel fluorescein patterns in this study. Simultaneous imaging of fluorescently-tagged M. oryzae (red) and FDA staining (green) in rice cells revealed characteristic features of the hemibiotrophic interaction. That is, newly invaded cells are alive but subsequently become dead when the fungus spreads into neighbor cells, and biotrophic interfacial complexes are associated with the host cytoplasm. This also revealed novel fluorescein patterns in invaded cells. Time-lapse imaging suggested that the FDA staining pattern in the infected host cell progressed from typical cytoplasmic localization (live cell with the intact vacuole), to novel patterns (dying cell with closed plasmodesmata with the shrunken or ruptured vacuole), to lack of fluorescence (dead cell). We have developed a method to visualize cellular events leading to host cell death during rice blast disease. This method can be used to compare and contrast host cell death associated with disease resistance and susceptibility in rice-M. oryzae and other host-pathogen interactions.",plant cell death play important role plantpathogen interaction study pathogeninduced cell death need cytological tool allow determining host cell viability also cellular event leading cell death visualization pathogen development describe live cell imaging method provide insight dynamic cell death rice oryza sativa method us livecell confocal microscopy rice sheath cell mechanically damaged invaded fluorescentlytagged magnaporthe oryzae together fluorescent dye fluorescein diacetate fda propidium iodide pi fda stain cytoplasm live cell exclusively thus also visualizing vacuole whereas pi stain nucleus dead cell first demonstrated confocal microscopy rice leaf sheath stained fda pi discriminated live cell mechanicallykilled cell fdaderived fluorescein confined cytoplasm live cell indicating intact vacuolar plasma membrane also observed previously unreported fluorescein pattern mechanically damaged cell pattern include homogeneous distribution fluorescein increased area cytoplasm due shrunken vacuole increase fluorescein intensity containment brighter fluorescein signal affected cell likely due closure plasmodesmata refer novel fluorescein pattern study simultaneous imaging fluorescentlytagged oryzae red fda staining green rice cell revealed characteristic feature hemibiotrophic interaction newly invaded cell alive subsequently become dead fungus spread neighbor cell biotrophic interfacial complex associated host cytoplasm also revealed novel fluorescein pattern invaded cell timelapse imaging suggested fda staining pattern infected host cell progressed typical cytoplasmic localization live cell intact vacuole novel pattern dying cell closed plasmodesmata shrunken ruptured vacuole lack fluorescence dead cell developed method visualize cellular event leading host cell death rice blast disease method used compare contrast host cell death associated disease resistance susceptibility ricem oryzae hostpathogen interaction,3,"{'Disease': ['dead fungus spread neighbor cell biotrophic interfacial complex associated host cytoplasm', 'host cell death associated disease resistance susceptibility ricem'], 'Treatment': ['live cell imaging method', 'method', 'dead cell developed method'], 'Symptom': []}",0
38863209,A KNOX Ⅱ transcription factor suppresses the NLR immune receptor BRG8-mediated immunity in rice.,"Nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are activated by detecting pathogen effectors, which in turn trigger host defenses and cell death. Although many NLRs have been identified, the mechanisms responsible for NLR-triggered defense responses are still poorly understood. In this study, through a genome-wide association study approach, we identified a novel NLR gene, Blast Resistance Gene 8 (BRG8), which confers resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight diseases. BRG8 overexpression and complementation lines exhibit enhanced resistance to both pathogens. Subcellular localization assays showed that BRG8 is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Additional evidence revealed that nuclear-localized BRG8 can enhance rice immunity without a hypersensitive response (HR)-like phenotype. We also demonstrated that the coiled-coil domain of BRG8 not only physically interacts with itself but also interacts with the KNOX Ⅱ protein HOMEOBOX ORYZA SATIVA59 (HOS59). Knockout mutants of HOS59 in the BRG8 background show enhanced resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae strain CH171 and Xoo strain CR4, similar to that of the BRG8 background. By contrast, overexpression of HOS59 in the BRG8 background will compromise the HR-like phenotype and resistance response. Further analysis revealed that HOS59 promotes the degradation of BRG8 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Collectively, our study highlights HOS59 as an NLR immune regulator that fine-tunes BRG8-mediated immune responses against pathogens, providing new insights into NLR associations and functions in plant immunity.",nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat nlr protein activated detecting pathogen effector turn trigger host defense cell death although many nlrs identified mechanism responsible nlrtriggered defense response still poorly understood study genomewide association study approach identified novel nlr gene blast resistance gene brg confers resistance rice blast bacterial blight disease brg overexpression complementation line exhibit enhanced resistance pathogen subcellular localization assay showed brg localized cytoplasm nucleus additional evidence revealed nuclearlocalized brg enhance rice immunity without hypersensitive response hrlike phenotype also demonstrated coiledcoil domain brg physically interacts also interacts knox ⅱ protein homeobox oryza sativa ho knockout mutant ho brg background show enhanced resistance magnaporthe oryzae strain ch xoo strain cr similar brg background contrast overexpression ho brg background compromise hrlike phenotype resistance response analysis revealed ho promotes degradation brg via proteasome pathway collectively study highlight ho nlr immune regulator finetunes brgmediated immune response pathogen providing new insight nlr association function plant immunity,1,"{'Disease': ['resistance rice blast bacterial blight disease brg overexpression complementation line exhibit enhanced resistance pathogen'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['detecting pathogen effector turn trigger host defense cell death']}",7
12684879,Three types of defense-responsive genes are involved in resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases in rice.,"Bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases of rice, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Pyricularia grisea Sacc., respectively, are two of the most devastating diseases in rice worldwide. To study the defense responses to infection with each of these pathogens, expression profiling of 12 defense-responsive genes was performed using near-isogenic rice lines that are resistant or susceptible to bacterial blight and fungal blast, respectively, and rice cultivars that are resistant or susceptible to both pathogens. All 12 genes showed constitutive expression, but expression levels increased in response to infection. Based on their expression patterns in 12 host-pathogen combinations, these genes could be classified into three types, pathogen non-specific (6), pathogen specific but race non-specific (4) and race specific (2). Most of the 12 genes were only responsive during incompatible interactions. These results suggest that bacterial blight and fungal blast resistances share common pathway(s), but are also regulated by different defense pathways in rice. Activation of the corresponding R gene is the key step that initiates the action of these genes in defense responses. The chromosomal locations and pathogen specificities of seven of the 12 genes were consistent with those of previously identified quantitative trait loci for rice disease resistance, which indicates that some of the 12 genes studied may have a phenotypic impact on disease resistance in rice.",bacterial blight fungal blast disease rice caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae pyricularia grisea sacc respectively two devastating disease rice worldwide study defense response infection pathogen expression profiling defenseresponsive gene performed using nearisogenic rice line resistant susceptible bacterial blight fungal blast respectively rice cultivar resistant susceptible pathogen gene showed constitutive expression expression level increased response infection based expression pattern hostpathogen combination gene could classified three type pathogen nonspecific pathogen specific race nonspecific race specific gene responsive incompatible interaction result suggest bacterial blight fungal blast resistance share common pathway also regulated different defense pathway rice activation corresponding r gene key step initiate action gene defense response chromosomal location pathogen specificity seven gene consistent previously identified quantitative trait locus rice disease resistance indicates gene studied may phenotypic impact disease resistance rice,4,"{'Disease': ['bacterial blight fungal blast disease rice', 'two devastating disease rice worldwide study defense response infection pathogen expression', 'quantitative trait locus rice disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
24757773,Genetic analysis of resistance to blast in the Vietnamese rice cultivar 'Chiembac'.,"The resistance to rice blast disease in the Vietnamese traditional rice cultivar 'Chiembac' was studied. The blast resistance spectrum in 'Chiembac' and 15 rice differentials carrying different known resistance genes was identified using 25 Pyricularia grisea isolates derived from 15 AFLP lineages from the North, Center and South of Vietnam. None of the differential lines carrying a single resistance gene could effectively control all tested Vietnamese blast isolates. 'Chiembac' showed a different resistance pattern compared to that of the differential lines. A cross between 'Chiembac' and 'CR203', an improved rice cultivar, was made and the F2 population was used for characterization and mapping of the resistance genes in 'Chiembac'. Genetic analysis showed that the resistance against two representative isolates from two predominant lineages, VT7 and 12, in 'Chiembac' was controlled by the single dominant genes Pi-VT7 and Pi-I2. The resistance gene Pi-VT7 was closely linked to Pi-I2 and was mapped to chromosome 12 using the framework mapping population 'IR64' x 'Azucena' of 124 double haploid progenies. The resistance to the Vietnamese blast isolate VT7 in 'IR64' was also studied. The latter was controlled by one locus with major effect located on chromosome 12 and mapped closely to the AFLP marker NIN080, which was also tightly linked to the resistance gene Pi-VT7 in 'Chiembac'.

22607456,Identification of positive and negative regulators of disease resistance to rice blast fungus using constitutive gene expression patterns.,"Elevated constitutive expression of components of the defence arsenal is associated with quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, a phenomenon called preformed defence. While the role of many disease regulators in inducible defence systems has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid so far to genes that regulate preformed defence. In this study, we show by microarray analysis across rice diversity that the preformed defence phenomenon impacts on a large number of defence-related genes without apparently affecting other biological processes. Using a guilt-by-association strategy, we identified two positive regulators that promote constitutive expression of known defence markers and partial resistance to rice blast. The HSF23 gene encodes for a putative member of the heat shock transcription factor family, while CaMBP encodes for a putative Calmodulin-binding protein. Both HSF23 and CaMBP strongly affect preformed defence and also plant growth.

23776629,Variability in aggressiveness of rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) isolates originating from rice leaves and necks: a case of pathogen specialization?,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, causes yield losses associated with injuries on leaves and necks, the latter being in general far more important than the former. Many questions remain on the relationships between leaf and neck blast, including questions related to the population biology of the pathogen. Our objective was to test the hypothesis of adaptation of M. oryzae isolates to the type of organ they infect. To that aim, the components of aggressiveness of isolates originating from leaves and necks were measured. Infection efficiency, latent period, sporulation intensity, and lesion size were measured on both leaves and necks. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that isolates originating from leaves were less aggressive than isolates originating from necks, when aggressiveness components were measured on leaves as well as on necks, indicating that there is no specialization within the pathogen population with respect to the type of organ infected. This result suggests that the more aggressive isolates involved in epidemics on leaves during the vegetative stage of the crop cycle have a higher probability to infect necks, and that a population shift may occur during disease transmission from leaves to necks. Implications for disease management are discussed.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae cause yield loss associated injury leaf neck latter general far important former many question remain relationship leaf neck blast including question related population biology pathogen objective test hypothesis adaptation oryzae isolates type organ infect aim component aggressiveness isolates originating leaf neck measured infection efficiency latent period sporulation intensity lesion size measured leaf neck univariate multivariate analysis indicated isolates originating leaf less aggressive isolates originating neck aggressiveness component measured leaf well neck indicating specialization within pathogen population respect type organ infected result suggests aggressive isolates involved epidemic leaf vegetative stage crop cycle higher probability infect neck population shift may occur disease transmission leaf neck implication disease management discussed,7,"{'Disease': ['disease transmission leaf neck implication disease management'], 'Treatment': ['disease transmission leaf neck implication disease management'], 'Symptom': []}",9
12955204,Molecular markers linked to the blast resistance gene Pi-z in rice for use in marker-assisted selection.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Pyricularia grisea, is a serious disease affecting rice-growing regions around the world. Current methods for identification of blast-resistant germplasm and progeny typically utilize phenotypic screening. However, phenotypic screens are influenced by environmental conditions and the presence of one resistance gene can sometimes phenotypically mask other genes conferring resistance to the same blast race. Pi-z is a dominant gene located on the short arm of chromosome 6 that confers complete resistance to five races of blast. Using sequence data found in public databases and degenerate primer pairs based on the P-loop, nucleotide binding sites and kinase domain motifs of previously cloned resistance genes, we have developed PCR-based DNA markers that cosegregate with the gene. These markers are polymorphic in a wide range of germplasm, including the narrow crosses characteristic of applied rice-breeding programs. They can now be used as a low cost, high-throughput alternative to conventional phenotypic screening for direct detection of blast resistance genes, allowing rapid introgression of genes into susceptible varieties as well as the incorporation of multiple genes into individual lines for more-durable blast resistance.",rice blast caused fungal pathogen pyricularia grisea serious disease affecting ricegrowing region around world current method identification blastresistant germplasm progeny typically utilize phenotypic screening however phenotypic screen influenced environmental condition presence one resistance gene sometimes phenotypically mask gene conferring resistance blast race piz dominant gene located short arm chromosome confers complete resistance five race blast using sequence data found public database degenerate primer pair based ploop nucleotide binding site kinase domain motif previously cloned resistance gene developed pcrbased dna marker cosegregate gene marker polymorphic wide range germplasm including narrow cross characteristic applied ricebreeding program used low cost highthroughput alternative conventional phenotypic screening direct detection blast resistance gene allowing rapid introgression gene susceptible variety well incorporation multiple gene individual line moredurable blast resistance,2,"{'Disease': ['fungal pathogen pyricularia grisea serious disease'], 'Treatment': ['world current method identification blastresistant germplasm progeny'], 'Symptom': []}",5

The population was evaluated for blast resistance in the greenhouse and the field, and was analyzed with 127 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. Two dominant loci associated with qualitative resistance to five isolates of the fungus were tentatively named Pi-5(t) and Pi-7(t). They were mapped on chromosomes 4 and 11, respectively. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting partial resistance, RI lines were inoculated with isolate PO6-6 of Pyricularia oryzae in polycyclic tests. Ten chromosomal segments were found to be associated with effects on lesion number (P < 0.0001 and LOD > 6.0). Three of the markers associated with QTLs for partial resistance had been reported to be linked to complete blast resistance in previous studies. QTLs identified in greenhouse tests were good predictors of blast resistance at two field sites.

The resistance in the rice line CO39 was inherited as a single dominant locus in segregating populations derived from F(2) and F(3) crosses between disease-resistant (CO39) and susceptible (51583) rice genotypes. Microsatellite, RFLP and resistance gene analog (RGA) markers were used to map the Pi-CO39(t) locus to a 1.2-cM interval between the probenazole-responsive ( RPR1) gene (0.2 cM) and RFLP marker S2712 (1.0 cM) on the short arm of rice chromosome 11.

23718837,Fine mapping and identification of blast resistance gene Pi-hk1 in a broad-spectrum resistant japonica rice landrace.,"One Japonica rice landrace, Heikezijing, from the Taihu Lake region of China, exhibits broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast. As characterized in our previous research, a main-effect resistance (R) gene, Pi-hk1, in Heikezijing against five isolates (GD10-279a, JS2004-141-1, JS2004-185, JS90-78, and Hoku1) was roughly mapped on the long arm of chromosome 11. To fine map Pi-hk1, one recombinant inbred line (RIL), RIL72 (F2:8), from the cross between Heikezijing and blast-susceptible variety Suyunuo, was further crossed and backcrossed with Suyunuo to produce a BC1F2 population of 477 individuals. Inoculation experiments with the representative isolate Hoku 1 indicated that RIL72 carries a single dominant R gene for blast resistance. With the help of advanced BC1F3 (915 plants), BC1F4 (4,459 plants), and BC1F5 (2,000 plants) mapping populations, Pi-hk1 was finally mapped to a 107-kb region between molecular markers P3586 and ILP3, and co-segregated with the markers P4098, RM7654, and P4099.

18943742,The role of silicon in preventing appressorial penetration by the rice blast fungus.,"To test the hypothesis that silicon (Si) confers resistance against appressorial penetration of the rice blast fungus, the proportion of appressorial penetration into the leaf epidermis to total appressoria formed was compared among rice plants amended with various rates of silica gel to those plants nonamended. The amounts of Si in the youngest leaves were consistent with the amounts of silica gel applied to the rice plants. Relative Si levels on the adaxial surface of leaves as detected by energy dispersive X-ray analysis also increased with the amounts of silica gel applied. Based on light microscopic observation of the adaxial surface of rice leaves, the proportion of appressorial penetration was reduced by increasing amounts of silica gel applied and increased with the length of period after spray inoculation. Consequently, these results strongly support the hypothesis and suggest that Si in the leaf epidermis may confer resistance against appressorial penetration. Meanwhile, the number of lesions per leaf also decreased with the amount of Si applied, while only a certain part of penetrated appressoria could become sporulating susceptible lesions. This suggests that Si also confers physiological resistance against blast infection after the penetration.",test hypothesis silicon si confers resistance appressorial penetration rice blast fungus proportion appressorial penetration leaf epidermis total appressoria formed compared among rice plant amended various rate silica gel plant nonamended amount si youngest leaf consistent amount silica gel applied rice plant relative si level adaxial surface leaf detected energy dispersive xray analysis also increased amount silica gel applied based light microscopic observation adaxial surface rice leaf proportion appressorial penetration reduced increasing amount silica gel applied increased length period spray inoculation consequently result strongly support hypothesis suggest si leaf epidermis may confer resistance appressorial penetration meanwhile number lesion per leaf also decreased amount si applied certain part penetrated appressoria could become sporulating susceptible lesion suggests si also confers physiological resistance blast infection penetration,8,"{'Disease': ['resistance appressorial penetration rice blast fungus proportion appressorial penetration leaf'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
18758744,"Fine mapping of a strong QTL of field resistance against rice blast, Pikahei-1(t), from upland rice Kahei, utilizing a novel resistance evaluation system in the greenhouse.","Field resistances (FR) against rice blast are highly evaluated by breeders for their durability, in contrast to the conspicuous but often less durable true resistances. However, lack of efficient systems for evaluation of resistance has delayed their practical application. Kahei, an upland domestic cv., is known for its very high FR against rice blast. We fine-mapped its highest quantitative trait loci (QTL), qBFR4-1, using residual heterozygosity of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and our semi-natural rice blast inoculation/evaluation system in the greenhouse, with comparable accuracy to the true resistance genes. This system enabled reproducible high-density infection, and consequently allowed quantification of the resistance level in individual plants. The target region was first narrowed down to about 1 Mb around at 32 Mb from the top of chromosome 4 in the Nipponbare genome, with the upland evaluation system assessing the F7 generation of Koshihikari (lowland, FR: very weak) x Kahei (upland, FR: very strong) RILs. Then, F9 plants (4,404)--siblings of hetero F8 plants at the region--were inoculated with rice blast in a greenhouse using the novel inoculation system, and individual resistance levels were diagnosed for fine QTL analysis and graphical genotyping. Thus, the resistance gene was fine-mapped within 300 kb at 31.2-31.5 Mb on chromosome 4, and designated Pikahei-1(t). By annotation analysis, seven resistance gene analog (RGA) ORFs of nucleotide-binding-site and leucine-rich-repeat (NBS-LRR)-type were found in the center of the region as the most likely candidate counterparts of the resistance gene.

21726399,Rice WRKY45 plays important roles in fungal and bacterial disease resistance.,"Plant 'activators', such as benzothiadiazole (BTH), protect plants from various diseases by priming the plant salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway. We have reported previously that a transcription factor identified in rice, WRKY45 (OsWRKY45), plays a pivotal role in BTH-induced disease resistance by mediating SA signalling. Here, we report further functional characterization of WRKY45. Different plant activators vary in their action points, either downstream (BTH and tiadinil) or upstream (probenazole) of SA. Rice resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, induced by both types of plant activator, was markedly reduced in WRKY45-knockdown (WRKY45-kd) rice, indicating a universal role for WRKY45 in chemical-induced resistance. Fungal invasion into rice cells was blocked at most attempted invasion sites (pre-invasive defence) in WRKY45-overexpressing (WRKY45-ox) rice. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated within the cell wall underneath invading fungus appressoria or between the cell wall and the cytoplasm, implying a possible role for H(2)O(2) in pre-invasive defence. Moreover, a hypersensitive reaction-like reaction was observed in rice cells, in which fungal growth was inhibited after invasion (post-invasive defence). The two levels of defence mechanism appear to correspond to Type I and II nonhost resistances. The leaf blast resistance of WRKY45-ox rice plants was much higher than that of other known blast-resistant varieties. WRKY45-ox plants also showed strong panicle blast resistance. BTH-induced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae was compromised in WRKY45-kd rice, whereas WRKY45-ox plants were highly resistant to this pathogen. However, WRKY45-ox plants were susceptible to Rhizoctonia solani.

20190078,Cell cycle-mediated regulation of plant infection by the rice blast fungus.,"To gain entry to plants, many pathogenic fungi develop specialized infection structures called appressoria. Here, we demonstrate that appressorium morphogenesis in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is tightly regulated by the cell cycle. Shortly after a fungus spore lands on the rice (Oryza sativa) leaf surface, a single round of mitosis always occurs in the germ tube. We found that initiation of infection structure development is regulated by a DNA replication-dependent checkpoint. Genetic intervention in DNA synthesis, by conditional mutation of the Never-in-Mitosis 1 gene, prevented germ tubes from developing nascent infection structures. Cellular differentiation of appressoria, however, required entry into mitosis because nimA temperature-sensitive mutants, blocked at mitotic entry, were unable to develop functional appressoria. Arresting the cell cycle after mitotic entry, by conditional inactivation of the Blocked-in-Mitosis 1 gene or expression of stabilized cyclinB-encoding alleles, did not impair appressorium differentiation, but instead prevented these cells from invading plant tissue. When considered together, these data suggest that appressorium-mediated plant infection is coordinated by three distinct cell cycle checkpoints that are necessary for establishment of plant disease.",gain entry plant many pathogenic fungi develop specialized infection structure called appressoria demonstrate appressorium morphogenesis rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae tightly regulated cell cycle shortly fungus spore land rice oryza sativa leaf surface single round mitosis always occurs germ tube found initiation infection structure development regulated dna replicationdependent checkpoint genetic intervention dna synthesis conditional mutation neverinmitosis gene prevented germ tube developing nascent infection structure cellular differentiation appressoria however required entry mitosis nima temperaturesensitive mutant blocked mitotic entry unable develop functional appressoria arresting cell cycle mitotic entry conditional inactivation blockedinmitosis gene expression stabilized cyclinbencoding allele impair appressorium differentiation instead prevented cell invading plant tissue considered together data suggest appressoriummediated plant infection coordinated three distinct cell cycle checkpoint necessary establishment plant disease,3,"{'Disease': ['appressoria demonstrate appressorium morphogenesis rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae tightly regulated cell cycle', 'shortly fungus spore land rice oryza sativa leaf surface single round mitosis', 'three distinct cell cycle checkpoint necessary establishment plant disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

This study aimed to investigate the defense responses in upland rice challenged with a virulent strain of M. oryzae after acclimation with an avirulent strain. The avirulent strain decreased rice blast severity in the challenged plants. Induced resistance was characterized by a hypersensitive response and early accumulation of phenolic compounds. Scanning electron microscopy showed that M. oryzae conidia germinate and form appressoria, but do not colonize leaf tissues. The activities of pathogenesis-related proteins, total phenolic compounds, and salicylic acid (SA) were affected by acclimation to the avirulent strain. The activities of β-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and peroxidase, as well as the SA levels explained most of the variability in the rice plant responses to M. oryzae. In addition, OsXa13, OsMAPKKK74, OsAOS2, OsACO7, and OsMAS1 expression was modulated depending on the virulence of the M. oryzae strains. This modulation in gene expression is critical for infection and some of these mechanisms are targeted by effectors, resulting in enhanced susceptibility and pathogen infection. These results have practical importance in plant-pathogen interaction studies to identify resistance-relevant mechanisms against M. oryzae in upland rice.",rice blast magnaporthe oryzae cause large loss crop yield especially upland rice system avirulent strain oryzae induce resistance subsequent attack virulent strain plant study aimed investigate defense response upland rice challenged virulent strain oryzae acclimation avirulent strain avirulent strain decreased rice blast severity challenged plant induced resistance characterized hypersensitive response early accumulation phenolic compound scanning electron microscopy showed oryzae conidium germinate form appressoria colonize leaf tissue activity pathogenesisrelated protein total phenolic compound salicylic acid sa affected acclimation avirulent strain activity βglucanase phenylalanine ammonialyase peroxidase well sa level explained variability rice plant response oryzae addition osxa osmapkkk osaos osaco osmas expression modulated depending virulence oryzae strain modulation gene expression critical infection mechanism targeted effector resulting enhanced susceptibility pathogen infection result practical importance plantpathogen interaction study identify resistancerelevant mechanism oryzae upland rice,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['modulation gene expression critical infection mechanism targeted effector']}",12
9291961,"Rice genetic resources: history, conservation, investigative characterization and use in Japan.","Rice has been grown in Japan for about 3000 years. Although both japonica and indica varieties have been grown in Japan, now japonica rices are grown. Japanese rice breeding has used an ecological breeding approach. While emphasis in rice breeding in the 1940's and 1950's focussed on yield in recent decades quality has been of major importance. Consumer preference and name recognition of high quality varieties, such as Koshihikari, has resulted in slow acceptance of new varieties. Rice germplasm was systematically collected throughout Japan between 1962 and 1963. Subsequent acquisition and collecting, in Japan and other countries, has resulted in 28,000 accessions being conserved in the National Genebank, based at the National institute of Agrobiological Resources (NIAR). Research on genetic diversity of rice using a range of techniques, for example esterase isozymes, has revealed clinal variation in rice radiating from the center of diversity of rice in and around southwest China. Newly found genes in traditional rice germplasm, such as genes for non-elongating mesocotyl, are now routinely identified on the rice genome. Pioneering studies on eco-genetic differentiation of species in the genus Oryza in Japan has revealed much about the complex genepool for which rice evolved. Pest and disease resistance sources, particularly to blast, bacterial blight and brown plant hopper, from many countries have been incorporated into Japanese varieties. Cold tolerance at the booting stage was found in the Indonesian variety Silewah.

19253284,Secretome analysis of differentially induced proteins in rice suspension-cultured cells triggered by rice blast fungus and elicitor.,"Secreted proteins were investigated in rice suspension-cultured cells treated with rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and its elicitor using biochemical and 2-DE coupled with MS analyses followed by their in planta mRNA expression analysis. M. grisea and elicitor successfully interacted with suspension-cultured cells and prepared secreted proteins from these cultures were essentially intracellular proteins free. Comparative 2-D gel analyses identified 21 differential protein spots due to M. grisea and/or elicitor over control. MALDI-TOF-MS and microLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses of these protein spots revealed that most of assigned proteins were involved in defense such as nine chitinases, two germin A/oxalate oxidases, five domain unknown function 26 (DUF 26) secretory proteins, and beta-expansin. One chitin binding chitinase protein was isolated using chitin binding beads and strong enzymatic activity was identified in an in-gel assay. Interestingly, their protein abundance correlated well at transcript levels in elicitor-treated cultures as judged by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Each identified differentially expressed protein group was compared at transcript levels in rice leaves inoculated with incompatible (KJ401) and compatible (KJ301) races of M. grisea.

30260973,Genetic enhancement of phosphorus starvation tolerance through marker assisted introgression of OsPSTOL1 gene in rice genotypes harbouring bacterial blight and blast resistance.,"Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient, is a prerequisite for various plant-growth mechanisms including root establishment/development, early/late vegetative stage development and reproductive stage development. Rice (Oryza sativa) is very sensitive to P starvation. Most cultivated genotypes have poor tolerance levels to P deficiency and consequently the grain yield is severely affected by P starvation. Since P deficiency of soils is a major concern of rice production areas, it is necessary to develop new cultivars with enhanced P tolerance. This is also an expectation of farmers and the Agriculture ministry of southern states of India where rice cultivation is intensive. Our objective was to introgress the phosphorus starvation tolerance (OsPSTOL1) gene through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) in to two intermediate genetic stocks of popular local-varieties namely, ASD 16 and ADT 43 which harbour bacterial blight and blast resistance (R) genes. To delve into the P starvation phenotypic effect, we have generated a set of four backcross inbred lines (BILs) with enhanced P starvation tolerance. The developed BILs showed altered root architecture pattern and greater root surface area with increased P uptake, confirming their adaptability to P deficient soil conditions. Further, a correlation between root traits and low/high P conditions indicates the function of introgressed OsPSTOL1 in BILs. The enhanced root characteristics, therefore, enabled the plants to access and effectively absorb available nutrients from soil. In summary, the unique features of the OsPSTOL1 BILs with bacterial blight and blast resistance can aid varietal development suitable for cultivation in P deficient soils.",phosphorus p essential macronutrient prerequisite various plantgrowth mechanism including root establishmentdevelopment earlylate vegetative stage development reproductive stage development rice oryza sativa sensitive p starvation cultivated genotype poor tolerance level p deficiency consequently grain yield severely affected p starvation since p deficiency soil major concern rice production area necessary develop new cultivar enhanced p tolerance also expectation farmer agriculture ministry southern state india rice cultivation intensive objective introgress phosphorus starvation tolerance ospstol gene markerassisted backcross breeding mabb two intermediate genetic stock popular localvarieties namely asd adt harbour bacterial blight blast resistance r gene delve p starvation phenotypic effect generated set four backcross inbred line bils enhanced p starvation tolerance developed bils showed altered root architecture pattern greater root surface area increased p uptake confirming adaptability p deficient soil condition correlation root trait lowhigh p condition indicates function introgressed ospstol bils enhanced root characteristic therefore enabled plant access effectively absorb available nutrient soil summary unique feature ospstol bils bacterial blight blast resistance aid varietal development suitable cultivation p deficient soil,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['p starvation phenotypic effect']}",11
34582620,"Suppressing chlorophyll degradation by silencing OsNYC3 improves rice resistance to Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of sheath blight.","Necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani Kühn (R. solani) causes serious diseases in many crops worldwide, including rice and maize sheath blight (ShB). Crop resistance to the fungus is a quantitative trait and resistance mechanism remains largely unknown, severely hindering the progress on developing resistant varieties. In this study, we found that resistant variety YSBR1 has apparently stronger ability to suppress the expansion of R. solani than susceptible Lemont in both field and growth chamber conditions. Comparison of transcriptomic profiles shows that the photosynthetic system including chlorophyll biosynthesis is highly suppressed by R. solani in Lemont but weakly in YSBR1. YSBR1 shows higher chlorophyll content than that of Lemont, and inducing chlorophyll degradation by dark treatment significantly reduces its resistance. Furthermore, three rice mutants and one maize mutant that carry impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis all display enhanced susceptibility to R. solani. Overexpression of OsNYC3, a chlorophyll degradation gene apparently induced expression by R. solani infection, significantly enhanced ShB susceptibility in a high-yield ShB-susceptible variety '9522'. However, silencing its transcription apparently improves ShB resistance without compromising agronomic traits or yield in field tests. Interestingly, altering chlorophyll content does not affect rice resistance to blight and blast diseases, caused by biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens, respectively. Our study reveals that chlorophyll plays an important role in ShB resistance and suppressing chlorophyll degradation induced by R. solani infection apparently improves rice ShB resistance.

38687884,Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor homologs Pib and PibH8 interact and contribute to immunity in rice.,"Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) sense pathogen effectors and activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Many plant NLRs form pairs with other NLRs to recognize effectors and initiate ETI. PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN BL1 (Pib), an NLR protein in rice (Oryza sativa), activates resistance by recognizing the rice blast effector AvrPib. The activation of Pib is suppressed by SH3 DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 2 (OsSH3P2) in the absence of AvrPib. However, how Pib triggers defense responses and whether Pib pairs with another NLR are not clear. In this study, we identified Pib by map-based cloning and showed that a homolog of Pib, PIB HOMOLOGUE 8 (PibH8), interacts with Pib. Pib and PibH8 mediate resistance to the Magnaporthe oryzae isolate Guy11, a rice blast strain carrying AvrPib. Interestingly, the pib/pibh8 double mutant exhibited enhanced susceptibility to Guy11 compared to the single mutant. Furthermore, PibH8 can oligomerize through its coiled-coil (CC) domain, which also contributes to the Pib-PibH8 interaction, suggesting that Pib and PibH8 may form a complex to recognize AvrPib. OsSH3P2 inhibited the interaction of Pib and PibH8 through association with the CC domain of PibH8. Taken together, these results indicate that both Pib and PibH8 are required for rice blast resistance to M. oryzae carrying AvrPib, which is negatively regulated by OsSH3P2. This study not only identifies an NLR that functions in rice blast resistance but also reveals a possible complex immune strategy in which homologous NLR proteins may regulate the complete activation of plant immunity.",plant nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat receptor nlrs sense pathogen effector activate effectortriggered immunity eti many plant nlrs form pair nlrs recognize effector initiate eti piricularia oryzae resistance bl pib nlr protein rice oryza sativa activates resistance recognizing rice blast effector avrpib activation pib suppressed sh domaincontaining protein osshp absence avrpib however pib trigger defense response whether pib pair another nlr clear study identified pib mapbased cloning showed homolog pib pib homologue pibh interacts pib pib pibh mediate resistance magnaporthe oryzae isolate guy rice blast strain carrying avrpib interestingly pibpibh double mutant exhibited enhanced susceptibility guy compared single mutant furthermore pibh oligomerize coiledcoil cc domain also contributes pibpibh interaction suggesting pib pibh may form complex recognize avrpib osshp inhibited interaction pib pibh association cc domain pibh taken together result indicate pib pibh required rice blast resistance oryzae carrying avrpib negatively regulated osshp study identifies nlr function rice blast resistance also reveals possible complex immune strategy homologous nlr protein may regulate complete activation plant immunity,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['leucinerich repeat receptor nlrs sense pathogen effector activate', 'rice blast effector avrpib activation']}",8

22044963,Expression of a bacterial chitosanase in rice plants improves disease resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Plant fungal pathogens change their cell wall components during the infection process to avoid degradation by host lytic enzymes, and conversion of the cell wall chitin to chitosan is likely to be one infection strategy of pathogens. Thus, introduction of chitosan-degradation activity into plants is expected to improve fungal disease resistance. Chitosanase has been found in bacteria and fungi, but not in higher plants. Here, we demonstrate that chitosanase, Cho1, from Bacillus circulans MH-K1 has antifungal activity against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Introduction of the cho1 gene conferred chitosanase activity to rice cells. Transgenic rice plants expressing Cho1 designed to be localized in the apoplast showed increased resistance to M. oryzae accompanied by increased generation of hydrogen peroxide in the infected epidermal cells. These results strongly suggest that chitosan exists in the enzyme-accessible surface of M. oryzae during the infection process and that the enhancement of disease resistance is attributable to the antifungal activity of the secreted Cho1 and to increased elicitation of the host defense response.",plant fungal pathogen change cell wall component infection process avoid degradation host lytic enzyme conversion cell wall chitin chitosan likely one infection strategy pathogen thus introduction chitosandegradation activity plant expected improve fungal disease resistance chitosanase found bacteria fungi higher plant demonstrate chitosanase cho bacillus circulans mhk antifungal activity rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae introduction cho gene conferred chitosanase activity rice cell transgenic rice plant expressing cho designed localized apoplast showed increased resistance oryzae accompanied increased generation hydrogen peroxide infected epidermal cell result strongly suggest chitosan exists enzymeaccessible surface oryzae infection process enhancement disease resistance attributable antifungal activity secreted cho increased elicitation host defense response,3,"{'Disease': ['fungal disease resistance chitosanase', 'mhk antifungal activity rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae introduction cho gene conferred chitosanase activity rice cell transgenic rice plant', 'enzymeaccessible surface oryzae infection process enhancement disease resistance attributable antifungal activity'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

From the digestion of the glucan by an endo-beta-(1-->3)-glucanase, one highly elicitor-active glucopentaose was purified as a reduced compound, tetraglucosyl glucitol. The structure of this tetraglucosyl glucitol as well as two other related tetraglucosyl glucitols was elucidated as follows: (1) Glcbeta(1-->3)Glcbeta(1-->3)(Glcbeta(1-->6)) Glcbeta(1-->3)Glucitol (most active fragment); (2) Glcbeta(1-->3)(Glcbeta(1-->6))Glcbeta(1-->3)Glcbeta (1-->3)Glucitol; and (3) Glcbeta(1-->6) Glcbeta(1-->3)Glcbeta(1-->3)Glcbeta(1-->3)Glucitol. However, a synthetic hexa-beta-glucoside, known as a minimal structural element for the phytoalexin elicitor for soybean cotyledon cells, did not induce phytoalexin biosynthesis in the rice cells. Conversely, the beta-glucan fragment from P. oryzae did not induce phytoalexin biosynthesis in the soybean cotyledon cells, indicating differences in the recognition of glucooligosaccharide elicitor signals in these two plants.

In this study, two rice lines, KP1 and KP2-Hd1, were obtained by introgressing the blast resistance genes Pi1 and Pi2 into KY131, respectively. However, both lines headed later than KY131. RICE60K SNP array analysis showed that Hd1 closely linked to Pi2 was introgressed into KP2-Hd1, and the linkage drag of Hd1 was broken by recombination. On the other hand, no known flowering genes were introgressed into KP1. Gene diagnosis by resequencing six flowering genes showed that KP1 carried functional Hd16 and Ghd8 alleles. Due to its suppression role in heading under long-day conditions, Ghd8 was chosen as the target for gene editing to disrupt its function. Four sgRNAs targeting different sites within Ghd8 were utilized to induce large-deletion mutations, which were easy to detect via agarose gel electrophoresis. All the ghd8-mutated KP1 lines were resistant to rice blast disease and headed earlier than the control KP1, even than KY131, under natural long-day conditions, which ensures its growth in Northeast China.

29619515,OsEXPA10 mediates the balance between growth and resistance to biotic stress in rice.,"OsEXPA10 gene coordinates the balance between rice development and biotic resistance. Expansins are proteins that can loosen the cell wall. Previous studies have indicated that expansin-encoding genes were involved in defense against abiotic stress, but little is known about the involvement of expansins in biotic stress. Brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the worst insect pests of rice in the Asia-Pacific planting area, and many efforts have been made to identify and clone BPH-resistance genes for use in breeding resistant cultivars. At the same time, rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea is one of the three major diseases that severely affect rice production worldwide. Here, we demonstrated that one rice expansin-encoding gene, OsEXPA10, functions in both rice growth and biotic resistance. Over expression of OsEXPA10 improved rice growth but also increased susceptibility to BPH infestation and blast attack, while knock-down OsEXPA10 gene expression resulted in reduced plant height and grain size, but also increased resistance to BPH and the blast pathogen.

22547659,Brassinosteroid action in flowering plants: a Darwinian perspective.,"The year 2012 marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's first botanical book, on the fertilization of orchids (1862), wherein he described pollen grains and outlined his evolutionary principles with respect to plant research. Five decades later, the growth-promoting effect of extracts of Orchid pollen on coleoptile elongation was documented. These studies led to the discovery of a new class of phytohormones, the brassinosteroids (BRs) that were isolated from rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen. These growth-promoting steroids, which regulate height, fertility, and seed-filling in crop plants such as rice (Oryza sativa), also induce stress- and disease resistance in green algae and angiosperms. The origin and current status of BR-research is described here, with reference to BR-action and -signal transduction, and it is shown that modern high-yield rice varieties with erect leaves are deficient in endogenous BRs. Since brassinosteroids induce pathogen resistance in rice plants and hence can suppress rice blast- and bacterial blight-diseases, genetic manipulation of BR-biosynthesis or -perception may be a means to increase crop production. Basic research on BR activity in plants, such as Arabidopsis and rice, has the potential to increase crop yields further as part of a 21th century 'green biotech-revolution' that can be traced back to Darwin's classical breeding experiments. It is concluded that 'Nothing in brassinosteroid research makes sense except in the light of Darwinian evolution' and the value of basic science is highlighted, with reference to the genetic engineering of better food crops that may become resistant to a variety of plant diseases.",year mark th anniversary publication charles darwin first botanical book fertilization orchid wherein described pollen grain outlined evolutionary principle respect plant research five decade later growthpromoting effect extract orchid pollen coleoptile elongation documented study led discovery new class phytohormone brassinosteroids br isolated rapeseed brassica napu pollen growthpromoting steroid regulate height fertility seedfilling crop plant rice oryza sativa also induce stress disease resistance green algae angiosperm origin current status brresearch described reference braction signal transduction shown modern highyield rice variety erect leaf deficient endogenous br since brassinosteroids induce pathogen resistance rice plant hence suppress rice blast bacterial blightdiseases genetic manipulation brbiosynthesis perception may mean increase crop production basic research br activity plant arabidopsis rice potential increase crop yield part th century green biotechrevolution traced back darwin classical breeding experiment concluded nothing brassinosteroid research make sense except light darwinian evolution value basic science highlighted reference genetic engineering better food crop may become resistant variety plant disease,8,"{'Disease': ['stress disease resistance green algae angiosperm origin current status brresearch', 'hence suppress rice blast bacterial blightdiseases genetic manipulation brbiosynthesis perception', 'resistant variety plant disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['five decade later growthpromoting effect extract']}",5

We have developed a strategy for creating disease resistance to M. oryzae whereby intercellular production of tamavidin 1, a biotin-binding protein from Pleurotus cornucopiae occurs in transgenic rice plants. The gene that encodes tamavidin 1, fused to the sequence for a secretion signal peptide derived from rice chitinase gene, was connected to the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and the resultant construct was introduced into rice. The tamavidin 1 was accumulated at levels of 0.1-0.2% of total soluble leaf proteins in the transgenic rice and it was localized in the intercellular space of rice leaves. The tamavidin 1 purified from the transgenic rice was active, it bound to biotin and inhibited in vitro growth of M. oryzae by causing biotin deficiency. The transgenic rice plants showed a significant resistance to M. oryzae.

20465417,One of two major paralogs of AVR-Pita1 is functional in Japanese rice blast isolates.,"We analyzed the avirulence gene AVR-Pita1 in Japanese rice blast isolates to determine how they gain virulence toward rice cultivars containing the Pita resistance gene. An avirulent isolate, OS99-G-7a (G7a), from a Japanese commercial field contained two paralogs of AVR-Pita1, designated as AVR-Pita1(JA) and AVR-Pita1(JB). Analysis of virulent, independent mutants derived from G7a, a single avirulent progenitor strain, indicated that AVR-Pita1(JA) was functional but AVR-Pita1(JB) was nonfunctional. The most frequent mutation was loss of AVR-Pita1(JA). Analyses of field isolates collected from diverse areas in Japan revealed that most of the AVR-Pita1 genes carried by Japanese isolates were identical to AVR-Pita1(JA) or AVR-Pita1(JB). The relationship between these major paralogs in Japanese isolates and the virulence of the strains carrying them indicate that AVR-Pita1(JA) is functional but AVR-Pita1(JB) is not, as is the case in G7a. Isolates that show virulence toward rice cultivars containing the Pita gene are presumed to have evolved virulence from avirulent origins via loss of AVR-Pita1(JA), except for one case in which virulence resulted from a base substitution. In this study, we discuss the properties and specificities of Japanese rice blasts that relate to virulence against Pita-containing rice.

Oxidative burst.,"Suspension cultured cells of six rice cultivars differing in their sensitivity to blast were treated with mycelial wall hydrolysates prepared from seven isolates belonging to different Pyricularia grisea lineages. Soon after elicitor addition, rice cells produced significant amounts of superoxide anion, which was rapidly converted into diffusible peroxide. Maximal effects were achieved at 50 mg L-1 elicitor. In all cases, a 7 to 13-fold increase in the basal rate of reactive oxygen species production was found. Neither differential effects among strains nor clear relationships between lineage and the resulting oxidative burst were evident. Interestingly, a good correlation was found between basal (and elicited) levels of peroxide generation and the overall tolerance of rice cultivars to the pathogen. About two days after elicitation, cell death occurred proportional to the amount of hydrogen peroxide released. Peroxide was required to trigger loss of cell viability, but the latter was not due to a direct toxic effect, suggesting the induction of programmed cell death. Results represent the first data aimed to develop in vitro tests for pathogenicity prediction of Italian blast lineages toward rice cultivars.",suspension cultured cell six rice cultivar differing sensitivity blast treated mycelial wall hydrolysate prepared seven isolates belonging different pyricularia grisea lineage soon elicitor addition rice cell produced significant amount superoxide anion rapidly converted diffusible peroxide maximal effect achieved mg l elicitor case fold increase basal rate reactive oxygen specie production found neither differential effect among strain clear relationship lineage resulting oxidative burst evident interestingly good correlation found basal elicited level peroxide generation overall tolerance rice cultivar pathogen two day elicitation cell death occurred proportional amount hydrogen peroxide released peroxide required trigger loss cell viability latter due direct toxic effect suggesting induction programmed cell death result represent first data aimed develop vitro test pathogenicity prediction italian blast lineage toward rice cultivar,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['diffusible peroxide maximal effect', 'neither differential effect', 'peroxide required trigger loss cell viability latter due direct toxic effect']}",2
39025063,A pair of E3 ubiquitin ligases control immunity and flowering by targeting different ELF3 proteins in rice.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays crucial roles in cellular processes including plant growth, development, and stress responses. In this study, we report that a pair of E3 ubiquitin ligases, AvrPiz-t-interaction protein 6 (APIP6) and IPA1-interaction protein 1 (IPI1), intricately target early flowering3 (ELF3) paralogous proteins to control rice immunity and flowering. APIP6 forms homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers with IPI1. Both proteins interact with OsELF3-2, promoting its degradation to positively control resistance against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae). Intriguingly, overexpression of IPI1 in Nipponbare caused significantly late-flowering phenotypes similar to the oself3-1 mutant. Except for late flowering, oself3-1 enhances resistance against M. oryzae. IPI1 also interacts with and promotes the degradation of OsELF3-1, a paralog of OsELF3-2. Notably, IPI1 and APIP6 synergistically modulate OsELF3s degradation, finely tuning blast disease resistance by targeting OsELF3-2, while IPI1 controls both disease resistance and flowering by targeting OsELF3-1.

38747865,Selection of rice breeding lines for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown in many countries around the world with different climatic conditions and a huge number of environmental stresses, both biotic (fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects) and abiotic (cold, drought, salinity) limit rice productivity. In this regard, breeders and scientists are trying to create rice lines that are resistant to multiple stresses. The aim of this work was to screen and select cold and blast resistant rice breeding lines (RBLs) using molecular markers. Molecular screening of RBLs and parental varieties to cold tolerance was carried out using markers RM24545, RM1377, RM231 and RM569 associated with QTLs (qPSST-3, qPSST-7, qPSST-9). It was discovered that the presence of three QTLs characterizes the cold resistance of studied genotypes, and the absence of one of them leads to cold sensitivity. As a result, 21 cold-resistant out of the 28 studied RBLs were identified. These cold resistant 21 RBLs were further tested to blast resistance using markers Pi-ta, Pita3, Z56592, 195R-1, NMSMPi9-1, TRS26, Pikh MAS, MSM6, 9871.T7E2b, RM224 and RM1233. It was revealed that 16 RBLs from 21 studied lines contain 5-6 blast resistance genes. In accordance with the blast resistance strategy, the presence of 5 or more genes ensures the formation of stable resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. Thus, 16 lines resistant to multiple stresses, such as cold and blast disease were developed. It should be noted that 6 of these selected lines are high-yielding, which is very important in rice breeding program. These RBLs can be used in breeding process as starting lines, germplasm exchange as a source of resistant genes for the development of new rice varieties resistant to multiple stress factors.",rice oryza sativa l grown many country around world different climatic condition huge number environmental stress biotic fungi bacteria virus insect abiotic cold drought salinity limit rice productivity regard breeder scientist trying create rice line resistant multiple stress aim work screen select cold blast resistant rice breeding line rbls using molecular marker molecular screening rbls parental variety cold tolerance carried using marker rm rm rm rm associated qtls qpsst qpsst qpsst discovered presence three qtls characterizes cold resistance studied genotype absence one lead cold sensitivity result coldresistant studied rbls identified cold resistant rbls tested blast resistance using marker pita pita z r nmsmpi trs pikh ma msm teb rm rm revealed rbls studied line contain blast resistance gene accordance blast resistance strategy presence gene ensures formation stable resistance magnaporthe oryzae thus line resistant multiple stress cold blast disease developed noted selected line highyielding important rice breeding program rbls used breeding process starting line germplasm exchange source resistant gene development new rice variety resistant multiple stress factor,2,"{'Disease': ['world different climatic condition huge number environmental stress biotic fungi bacteria virus', 'resistant multiple stress cold blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
18444970,Production of cecropin A in transgenic rice plants has an impact on host gene expression.,"Expression of the cecropin A gene in rice confers resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. In this study, a polymerase chain reaction-based suppression subtractive hybridization approach was used to generate a cDNA macroarray from the elite japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar 'Senia'. Gene expression studies revealed that the expression of components of the protein secretory and vesicular transport machinery is co-ordinately activated at the pre-invasive stage of infection of rice by the blast fungus. Comparisons of gene expression between wild-type and cecropin A plants revealed the over-expression of genes involved in protection against oxidative stress in transgenic plants in the absence of the pathogen, which correlated well with the tolerance of these plants to oxidative stress. A subcellular fractionation analysis suggested that cecropin A accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum in cecropin A rice. Moreover, a large number of genes related to the processes of synthesis, folding and stabilization of proteins that enter into the secretory pathway are over-expressed in cecropin A rice, confirming that these plants constitutively express the unfolded protein response. Transgenic expression of cecropin A in rice has an effect on the transcriptional reprogramming that accompanies plant adaptation to fungal infection. Overall, this study provides evidence for transgene-induced changes in gene expression in cecropin A rice under both optimal growth conditions and stress conditions imposed by fungal infection. The data also indicate that resistance to blast in cecropin A rice may be the consequence of a combination of the antifungal activity of cecropin A and cecropin A-mediated over-expression of rice genes.",expression cecropin gene rice confers resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae study polymerase chain reactionbased suppression subtractive hybridization approach used generate cdna macroarray elite japonica rice oryza sativa l cultivar senia gene expression study revealed expression component protein secretory vesicular transport machinery coordinately activated preinvasive stage infection rice blast fungus comparison gene expression wildtype cecropin plant revealed overexpression gene involved protection oxidative stress transgenic plant absence pathogen correlated well tolerance plant oxidative stress subcellular fractionation analysis suggested cecropin accumulates endoplasmic reticulum cecropin rice moreover large number gene related process synthesis folding stabilization protein enter secretory pathway overexpressed cecropin rice confirming plant constitutively express unfolded protein response transgenic expression cecropin rice effect transcriptional reprogramming accompanies plant adaptation fungal infection overall study provides evidence transgeneinduced change gene expression cecropin rice optimal growth condition stress condition imposed fungal infection data also indicate resistance blast cecropin rice may consequence combination antifungal activity cecropin cecropin amediated overexpression rice gene,7,"{'Disease': ['resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae study polymerase chain'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['unfolded protein response transgenic expression cecropin rice effect transcriptional reprogramming accompanies plant adaptation fungal infection']}",7
21971181,Suppression of plant-generated reactive oxygen species is required for successful infection by the rice blast fungus.,"Magnaporthe oryzae is a filamentous ascomycete that continuously threatens global rice production. The infection cycle of this pathogen commences with the attachment of conidia to rice plants, followed by the formation and maturation of a specialized infection structure-the appressorium. Melanized appressoria generate immense turgor pressure, which allows the fungus to break through the plant cuticle and cell wall by means of a penetration peg. These stages occur within the first twenty-four hours after which time the penetration peg gives rise to and subsequent primary and secondary infection hyphae. Upon infection, the plant recognizes the pathogen, triggering a series of defense responses and signaling events including the secretion of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In a recent paper, we showed that barley plants generate ROS and cell wall appositions (CWAs) around infection sites and that a fungal gene we termed MoHYR1 is necessary for ameliorating these defense reactions and ensuring successful infection and colonization. When this gene is deleted from the M. oryzae genome, the plant oxidative responses are stronger and disease is reduced.",magnaporthe oryzae filamentous ascomycete continuously threatens global rice production infection cycle pathogen commences attachment conidium rice plant followed formation maturation specialized infection structurethe appressorium melanized appressoria generate immense turgor pressure allows fungus break plant cuticle cell wall mean penetration peg stage occur within first twentyfour hour time penetration peg give rise subsequent primary secondary infection hypha upon infection plant recognizes pathogen triggering series defense response signaling event including secretion reactive oxygen specie ro recent paper showed barley plant generate ro cell wall apposition cwas around infection site fungal gene termed mohyr necessary ameliorating defense reaction ensuring successful infection colonization gene deleted oryzae genome plant oxidative response stronger disease reduced,3,"{'Disease': ['fungus break plant cuticle cell wall mean penetration peg stage', 'oryzae genome plant oxidative response stronger disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

Early after elicitation, even low hydrolysate concentrations were able to induce a significant increase in enzyme levels. However, neither rice genotypes showing differential sensitivity to blast reacted differently, nor did elicitors obtained from various pathotypes induce different reactions. At a later stage, higher hydrolysate concentrations were required to trigger maximal enzyme induction. Also in this case, only slight variations were detected in suspension cultures of a given cultivar treated with different elicitors. On the contrary, highly significant differences were observed among plant genotypes. A clear relationship was evident between the mean increase in PAL activity and the overall resistance to blast at the plant level. This trait could therefore represent a useful tool in selection for increased blast tolerance.",phenylalanine ammonia lyase palspecific activity level measured suspensioncultured cell six rice cultivar following treatment cell wall hydrolysate prepared seven pyricularia grisea strain early elicitation even low hydrolysate concentration able induce significant increase enzyme level however neither rice genotype showing differential sensitivity blast reacted differently elicitors obtained various pathotypes induce different reaction later stage higher hydrolysate concentration required trigger maximal enzyme induction also case slight variation detected suspension culture given cultivar treated different elicitors contrary highly significant difference observed among plant genotype clear relationship evident mean increase pal activity overall resistance blast plant level trait could therefore represent useful tool selection increased blast tolerance,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['treatment cell wall hydrolysate'], 'Symptom': []}",2
19039666,"A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, OsWAK1, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance.","Wall-associated protein kinases (WAKs) are a new group of receptor-like kinases (RLK) recently identified in Arabidopsis. A cDNA encoding a novel WAK was isolated from rice and was named OsWAK1 (Oryza sativa WAK). The deduced amino acid sequence of OsWAK1 showed 27.6% identity to WAK2 from Arabidopsis. OsWAK1 not only has the ability of autophosphorylation but also can phosphorylate OsRFP1, a putative transcription regulator recently identified in rice. OsRFP1 strongly interacts with the kinase domain of OsWAK1. This demonstrated that OsWAK1 is a functional protein kinase. A fusion protein of OsWAK1 with GFP was found to be localized on the cell surface. Plasmolysis experiments further revealed OsWAK1 is associated with the cell wall. Northern blotting analysis showed that infection of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae significantly induced the OsWAK1 transcripts, and the accumulation of OsWAK1 mRNA occurred earlier and was more abundant in rice leaves infected with an incompatible race than with a compatible race of the blast fungus. OsWAK1 was also induced after treatment by mechanical wounding, SA and MeJA, but not by ABA. These results imply that OsWAK1 is a novel gene involved in plant defense. Furthermore, six transgenic rice lines with constitutive expression of OsWAK1 became resistant to the compatible race. However, OsWAK1 expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions.

20229250,Genomic structure and evolution of the Pi2/9 locus in wild rice species.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is a devastating disease of rice worldwide. Among the 85 mapped resistance (R) genes against blast, 13 have been cloned and characterized. However, how these genes originated and how they evolved in the Oryza genus remains unclear. We previously cloned the rice blast R-genes Pi2, Pi9, and Piz-t, and analyzed their genomic structure and evolution in cultivated rice. In this study, we determined the genomic sequences of the Pi2/9 locus in four wild Oryza species representing three genomes (AA, BB and CC). The number of Pi2/9 family members in the four wild species ranges from two copies to 12 copies. Although these genes are conserved in structure and categorized into the same subfamily, sequence duplications and subsequent inversions or uneven crossing overs were observed, suggesting that the locus in different wild species has undergone dynamic changes. Positive selection was found in the leucine-rich repeat region of most members, especially in the largest clade where Pi9 is included. We also provide evidence that the Pi9 gene is more related to its homologues in the recurrent line and other rice cultivars than to those in its alleged donor species O. minuta, indicating a possible origin of the Pi9 gene from O. sativa.

36710512,A major genetic locus in neighbours controls changes of gene expression and susceptibility in intraspecific rice mixtures.,"Reports indicate that intraspecific neighbours alter the physiology of focal plants, and with a few exceptions, their molecular responses to neighbours are unknown. Recently, changes in susceptibility to pathogen resulting from such interactions were demonstrated, a phenomenon called neighbour-modulated susceptibility (NMS). However, the genetics of NMS and the associated molecular responses are largely unexplored. Here, we analysed in rice the modification of biomass and susceptibility to the blast fungus pathogen in the Kitaake focal genotype in the presence of 280 different neighbours. Using genome-wide association studies, we identified the loci in the neighbour that determine the response in Kitaake. Using a targeted transcriptomic approach, we characterized the molecular responses in focal plants co-cultivated with various neighbours inducing a reduction in susceptibility. Our study demonstrates that NMS is controlled by one major locus in the rice genome of its neighbour. Furthermore, we show that this locus can be associated with characteristic patterns of gene expression in focal plant. Finally, we propose an hypothesis where Pi could play a role in explaining this case of NMS. Our study sheds light on how plants affect the physiology in their neighbourhood and opens perspectives for understanding plant-plant interactions.",report indicate intraspecific neighbour alter physiology focal plant exception molecular response neighbour unknown recently change susceptibility pathogen resulting interaction demonstrated phenomenon called neighbourmodulated susceptibility nm however genetics nm associated molecular response largely unexplored analysed rice modification biomass susceptibility blast fungus pathogen kitaake focal genotype presence different neighbour using genomewide association study identified locus neighbour determine response kitaake using targeted transcriptomic approach characterized molecular response focal plant cocultivated various neighbour inducing reduction susceptibility study demonstrates nm controlled one major locus rice genome neighbour furthermore show locus associated characteristic pattern gene expression focal plant finally propose hypothesis pi could play role explaining case nm study shed light plant affect physiology neighbourhood open perspective understanding plantplant interaction,8,"{'Disease': ['largely unexplored analysed rice modification biomass susceptibility blast fungus pathogen'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

A third subpopulation composed of susceptible lines with similar heading time was used for mapping of partial resistance to neck blast with a third isolate. The traits measured for partial resistance included diseased leaf area (DLA), lesion size (LS) and lesion number (LN) for leaf blast and lesion length (LL) and conidium amount (CA) for neck blast. A linkage map consisting of 168 DNA markers was constructed by using the whole RIL population. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conditioning these traits were determined at one-locus and two-locus levels. Eleven main-effect QTLs and 28 digenic interactions were detected by QTLMapper 1.01 b. Only three QTLs showing main effects were also involved in digenic interactions for the same trait. General contributions of epistatic QTLs of each trait ranged from 16.0% to 51.7%, while those of main-effect QTLs of each trait ranged from 4.7% to 38.8%.

Although the rice-M. oryzae interaction has been studied extensively, the early molecular events that occur in rice before full maturation of the appressorium during M. oryzae invasion are unknown. Here, we report a comparative transcriptomics analysis of the durably resistant rice variety Digu and the susceptible rice variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) in response to infection by M. oryzae (5, 10 and 20 h post-inoculation, prior to full development of the appressorium). We found that the transcriptional responses differed significantly between these two rice varieties. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed that many biological processes, including extracellular recognition and biosynthesis of antioxidants, terpenes and hormones, were specifically activated in Digu shortly after infection. Forty-eight genes encoding receptor kinases (RKs) were significantly differentially regulated by M. oryzae infection in Digu. One of these genes, LOC_Os08g10300, encoding a leucine-rich repeat RK from the LRR VIII-2 subfamily, conferred enhanced resistance to M. oryzae when overexpressed in rice.

38709298,Exogenous Indole-3-Acetic Acid Suppresses Rice Infection of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> by Affecting Plant Resistance and Fungal Growth.,"Auxin is an important phytohormone that regulates diverse biologic processes, including plant growth and immunity. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), known as one of the main forms of auxin, is able to activate plant immunity. However, it is unknown whether IAA enhances plant resistance and/or suppresses the growth of the fungal pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. Here, we found that IAA could induce expression levels of pathogenesis-related genes to enhance disease resistance and could control the development of blast disease through inhibiting <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Exogenous IAA suppressed mycelial growth and delayed spore germination by inhibiting fungal endogenous IAA biosynthesis and impairing redox homeostasis, respectively. When applied to a field test, two IAA analogues, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid, can effectively control rice blast disease.

21751161,Analysis of simple sequence repeat markers linked with blast disease resistance genes in a segregating population of rice (Oryza sativa).,"Among 120 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, 23 polymorphic markers were used to identify the segregation ratio in 320 individuals of an F(2) rice population derived from Pongsu Seribu 2, a resistant variety, and Mahsuri, a susceptible rice cultivar. For phenotypic study, the most virulent blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) pathotype, P7.2, was used in screening of F(2) population in order to understand the inheritance of blast resistance as well as linkage with SSR markers. Only 11 markers showed a good fit to the expected segregation ratio (1:2:1) for the single gene model (d.f. = 1.0, P < 0.05) in chi-square (χ(2)) analyses. In the phenotypic data analysis, the F(2) population segregated in a 3:1 (R:S) ratio for resistant and susceptible plants, respectively. Therefore, resistance to blast pathotype P7.2 in Pongsu Seribu 2 is most likely controlled by a single nuclear gene. The plants from F(2) lines that showed resistance to blast pathotype P7.2 were linked to six alleles of SSR markers, RM168 (116 bp), RM8225 (221 bp), RM1233 (175 bp), RM6836 (240 bp), RM5961 (129 bp), and RM413 (79 bp).

31301098,Identification of endogenous small peptides involved in rice immunity through transcriptomics- and proteomics-based screening.,"Small signalling peptides, generated from larger protein precursors, are important components to orchestrate various plant processes such as development and immune responses. However, small signalling peptides involved in plant immunity remain largely unknown. Here, we developed a pipeline using transcriptomics- and proteomics-based screening to identify putative precursors of small signalling peptides: small secreted proteins (SSPs) in rice, induced by rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and its elicitor, chitin. We identified 236 SSPs including members of two known small signalling peptide families, namely rapid alkalinization factors and phytosulfokines, as well as many other protein families that are known to be involved in immunity, such as proteinase inhibitors and pathogenesis-related protein families. We also isolated 52 unannotated SSPs and among them, we found one gene which we named immune response peptide (IRP) that appeared to encode the precursor of a small signalling peptide regulating rice immunity. In rice suspension cells, the expression of IRP was induced by bacterial peptidoglycan and fungal chitin. Overexpression of IRP enhanced the expression of a defence gene, PAL1 and induced the activation of the MAPKs in rice suspension cells. Moreover, the IRP protein level increased in suspension cell medium after chitin treatment. Collectively, we established a simple and efficient pipeline to discover SSP candidates that probably play important roles in rice immunity and identified 52 unannotated SSPs that may be useful for further elucidation of rice immunity.

They recognize patterns produced by the pathogen invasion and often work as complexes in the plasma membrane. Among these RLKs, there is increasing evidence in several plant species of the key role of Wall-associated kinases (WAKs) in disease resistance. We recently showed using rice (Oryza sativa) loss-of-function mutants of three transcriptionally co-regulated OsWAK genes that individual OsWAKs are positively required for quantitative resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. This finding was unexpected since WAK genes belong to large gene families where functional redundancy is expected.

In this study, progeny of the cross between a tropical japonica rice cultivar Katy containing the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta and a temperate japonica cultivar M202 (pi-ta)' [corrected]. were inoculated with the race IB49 of Magnaporthe oryzae that recognizes Pi-ta. The resistant progeny were identified during backcrossing for five generations. Two progeny of each of the 22 BC(5)F(1) were genotyped using 12 simple sequence repeat markers around the Pi-ta genomic region on chromosome 12. Unlinked DNA in 43 BC(5)F(2) individuals was found primarily from the recurrent parent M202 as expected. However, unexpectedly, various sizes of genomic fragments around Pi-ta ranging from half (14 Mbp) to the entire chromosome (27 Mbp) were found from the donor. Similarly, large segments of comparable sizes of the Pi-ta genomic region originating from a landrace indica variety Tetep from Vietnam were also identified in Pi-ta containing US rice cultivars, Katy, Madison, Kaybonnet, and Drew. It was also determined that Tetep had an identical chromosome 12 to another landrace cultivar Tadukan from the Philippines.

The genomic sequence of the reference japonica variety Nipponbare was used for an in silico prediction of the resistance (R) gene content of the interval and hence for the identification of candidate gene(s) for Pi36. Three such sequences, which all had both a nucleotide-binding site and a leucine-rich repeat motif, were present. The three candidate genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of a number of varieties by long-range PCR, and the resulting amplicons were inserted into pCAMBIA1300 and/or pYLTAC27 vectors to determine sequence polymorphisms correlated to the resistance phenotype and to perform transgenic complementation tests. Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into the blast-susceptible variety Q1063, which allowed the identification of Pi36-3 as the functional gene, with the other two candidates being probable pseudogenes. The Pi36-encoded protein is composed of 1056 amino acids, with a single substitution event (Asp to Ser) at residue 590 associated with the resistant phenotype. Pi36 is a single-copy gene in rice and is more closely related to the barley powdery mildew resistance genes Mla1 and Mla6 than to the rice blast R genes Pita, Pib, Pi9, and Piz-t.

26089149,Repression of microRNA biogenesis by silencing of OsDCL1 activates the basal resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.,"The RNaseIII enzyme Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) processes the microRNA biogenesis and plays a determinant role in plant development. In this study, we reported the function of OsDCL1 in the immunity to rice blast, the devastating disease caused by the fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. Expression profiling demonstrated that different OsDCLs responded dynamically and OsDCL1 reduced its expression upon the challenge of rice blast pathogen. In contrast, miR162a predicted to target OsDCL1 increased its expression, implying a negative feedback loop between OsDCL1 and miR162a in rice. In addition to developmental defects, the OsDCL1-silencing mutants showed enhanced resistance to virulent rice blast strains in a non-race specific manner. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and cell death were observed in the contact cells with infectious hyphae, revealing that silencing of OsDCL1 activated cellular defense responses. In OsDCL1 RNAi lines, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 5 and 7 were down- and up-regulated, respectively, indicating that miRNAs responded dynamically in the interaction between rice and rice blast. Moreover, silencing of OsDCL1 activated the constitutive expression of defense related genes.

30387038,NAC transcription factor ONAC066 positively regulates disease resistance by suppressing the ABA signaling pathway in rice.,"This is the first time to dissect the mechanism of NACs-mediated disease resistance in plants using metabolomic approach and discover the involvement of ABA signaling pathway in NACs-mediated disease resistance. NAC transcription factors have been validated as important regulators in stress responses, but their molecular mechanisms in plant disease resistance are still largely unknown. Here we report that the NAC gene ONAC066 (LOC_Os01g09550) is significantly activated by rice blast infection. ONAC066 is ubiquitously expressed and this protein is localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of ONAC066 quantitatively enhances resistance to blast disease and bacterial blight in rice. The transcript levels of PR genes are also dramatically induced in ONAC066 overexpressing plants. Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) strongly activates the transcription of ONAC066 in rice. Further analysis shows that overexpression of ONAC066 remarkably suppresses the expression of ABA-related genes, whereas there are no obvious differences for salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)-related genes between wild-type and ONAC066 overexpressing plants. Consistently, lower endogenous ABA levels are identified in ONAC066 overexpressing plants compared with wild-type plants before and after blast inoculation, while no significant differences are observed for the SA and JA levels. Yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that ONAC066 directly binds to the promoters of LIP9 and NCED4 to modulate their expression. Moreover, the metabolomic study reveals that the ONAC066 overexpressing plants accumulated higher contents of soluble sugars and amino acids both before and after pathogen attack, when compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, our results suggest that ONAC066 positively regulates rice resistance to blast and bacterial blight, and ONAC066 exerts its functions on disease resistance by modulating of ABA signaling pathway, sugars and amino acids accumulation in rice.",first time dissect mechanism nacsmediated disease resistance plant using metabolomic approach discover involvement aba signaling pathway nacsmediated disease resistance nac transcription factor validated important regulator stress response molecular mechanism plant disease resistance still largely unknown report nac gene onac locosg significantly activated rice blast infection onac ubiquitously expressed protein localized nucleus overexpression onac quantitatively enhances resistance blast disease bacterial blight rice transcript level pr gene also dramatically induced onac overexpressing plant exogenous abscisic acid aba strongly activates transcription onac rice analysis show overexpression onac remarkably suppresses expression abarelated gene whereas obvious difference salicylic acid sa jasmonic acid jarelated gene wildtype onac overexpressing plant consistently lower endogenous aba level identified onac overexpressing plant compared wildtype plant blast inoculation significant difference observed sa ja level yeast onehybrid assay demonstrate onac directly bind promoter lip nced modulate expression moreover metabolomic study reveals onac overexpressing plant accumulated higher content soluble sugar amino acid pathogen attack compared wildtype plant taken together result suggest onac positively regulates rice resistance blast bacterial blight onac exerts function disease resistance modulating aba signaling pathway sugar amino acid accumulation rice,4,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance plant', 'disease resistance nac transcription factor', 'important regulator stress response molecular mechanism plant disease resistance', 'resistance blast disease bacterial blight rice transcript level pr gene', 'rice resistance blast bacterial blight onac exerts function disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
27240428,Jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine is required for the production of a flavonoid phytoalexin but not diterpenoid phytoalexins in ultraviolet-irradiated rice leaves.,"Rice produces low-molecular-weight antimicrobial compounds known as phytoalexins, in response to not only pathogen attack but also abiotic stresses including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Rice phytoalexins are composed of diterpenoids and a flavonoid. Recent studies have indicated that endogenous jasmonyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is not necessarily required for the production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in blast-infected or CuCl2-treated rice leaves. However, JA-Ile is required for the accumulation of the flavonoid phytoalexin, sakuranetin. Here, we investigated the roles of JA-Ile in UV-induced phytoalexin production. We showed that UV-irradiation induces the biosynthesis of JA-Ile and its precursor jasmonic acid.

38153818,GERWR: Identifying the Key Pathogenicity- Associated sRNAs of Magnaporthe Oryzae Infection in Rice Based on Graph Embedding and Random Walk With Restart.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae(M.oryzae), is a destructive rice disease that reduces rice yield by 10% to 30% annually. It also affects other cereal crops such as barley, wheat, rye, millet, sorghum, and maize. Small RNAs (sRNAs) play an essential regulatory role in fungus-plant interaction during the fungal invasion, but studies on pathogenic sRNAs during the fungal invasion of plants based on multi-omics data integration are rare. This paper proposes a novel approach called Graph Embedding combined with Random Walk with Restart (GERWR) to identify pathogenic sRNAs based on multi-omics data integration during M.oryzae invasion. By constructing a multi-omics network (MRMO), we identified 29 pathogenic sRNAs of rice blast fungus. Further analysis revealed that these sRNAs regulate rice genes in a many-to-many relationship, playing a significant regulatory role in the pathogenesis of rice blast disease. This paper explores the pathogenic factors of rice blast disease from the perspective of multi-omics data analysis, revealing the inherent connection between pathogenic factors of different omics.

High-resolution genetic mapping and sequencing of the gene region in the Pikm-containing cultivar Tsuyuake narrowed down the candidate region to a 131-kb genomic interval. Sequence analysis predicted two adjacently arranged resistance-like genes, Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS, within this candidate region. These genes encoded proteins with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and were considered the most probable candidates for Pikm. However, genetic complementation analysis of transgenic lines individually carrying these two genes negated the possibility that either Pikm1-TS or Pikm2-TS alone was Pikm. Instead, it was revealed that transgenic lines carrying both of these genes expressed blast resistance. The results of the complementation analysis and an evaluation of the resistance specificity of the transgenic lines to blast isolates demonstrated that Pikm-specific resistance is conferred by cooperation of Pikm1-TS and Pikm2-TS.

16832648,Genetic characterization and fine mapping of the blast resistance locus Pigm(t) tightly linked to Pi2 and Pi9 in a broad-spectrum resistant Chinese variety.,"The identification and utilization of broad-spectrum resistance genes have been proven the most effective and economical approach to control rice blast disease. To understand the molecular mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, we conducted genetic and fine mapping analysis of the blast resistance gene in a Chinese rice variety: Gumei 4 (GM4) identified with broad-spectrum resistance and used in rice breeding for blast resistance for more than 20 years. Genetic and mapping analysis indicated that blast resistance to nine isolates of different Chinese races in GM4 was controlled by the same dominant locus designated as Pigm(t) that was finely mapped to an approximately 70-kb interval between markers C5483 and C0428 on chromosome 6, which contains five candidate NBS--LRR disease resistance genes. The allelism test showed that Pigm(t) was either tightly linked or allelic to Pi2 and Pi9, two known blast resistance genes. Mapping information also indicated that another blast resistance gene Pi26(t) might also be located at the same region. Candidate genes were identified by sequence analysis of the Nipponbare and Pi9 locus and the corresponding region in GM4. Sequence divergence of candidate genes was observed between GM4 and model varieties Nipponbare and 9311, and Pi9.

In this study, we cloned 22 genes from 12 cultivars based on allele-mining strategy at this locus and identified 6 rice blast R genes with 4 of them recognizing more than one isolates. Our result suggests that gene stacking might be the evolutionary strategy for complex gene locus to interact with rapidly evolving pathogens, which might provide a potential way for the cloning of durable resistance genes.

Impairment in either SL-biosynthetic dwarf17 (d17) or -signaling (d14) led to increased susceptibility towards M. oryzae. Comparative transcriptome profiling of the SL-signaling d14 mutant and WT plants revealed that a large number of defense-associated genes including hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-, ethylene- and cell wall-synthesis-related genes were remarkably suppressed in d14 with respect to that of WT plants, during M. oryzae infection. In addition, various KEGG metabolic pathways related to sugar metabolism were significantly suppressed in the d14 plants compared to WT, during M. oryzae infection. Accordingly, WT plants accumulated increased levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and soluble sugar content compared to that of d17 and d14 in response to M. oryzae infection. Altogether, these results propose that SLs positively regulated rice defense against M. oryzae through involvement in the induction of various defense associated genes/pathways.",study present evidence strigolactones sl promote defense devastating rice blast fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae impairment either slbiosynthetic dwarf signaling led increased susceptibility towards oryzae comparative transcriptome profiling slsignaling mutant wt plant revealed large number defenseassociated gene including hydrogen peroxide hsubsubosubsub ethylene cell wallsynthesisrelated gene remarkably suppressed respect wt plant oryzae infection addition various kegg metabolic pathway related sugar metabolism significantly suppressed plant compared wt oryzae infection accordingly wt plant accumulated increased level hsubsubosubsub soluble sugar content compared response oryzae infection altogether result propose sl positively regulated rice defense oryzae involvement induction various defense associated genespathways,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",12

22570632,"Principles of carbon catabolite repression in the rice blast fungus: Tps1, Nmr1-3, and a MATE-family pump regulate glucose metabolism during infection.","Understanding the genetic pathways that regulate how pathogenic fungi respond to their environment is paramount to developing effective mitigation strategies against disease. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a global regulatory mechanism found in a wide range of microbial organisms that ensures the preferential utilization of glucose over less favourable carbon sources, but little is known about the components of CCR in filamentous fungi. Here we report three new mediators of CCR in the devastating rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae: the sugar sensor Tps1, the Nmr1-3 inhibitor proteins, and the multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)-family pump, Mdt1. Using simple plate tests coupled with transcriptional analysis, we show that Tps1, in response to glucose-6-phosphate sensing, triggers CCR via the inactivation of Nmr1-3. In addition, by dissecting the CCR pathway using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated mutagenesis, we also show that Mdt1 is an additional and previously unknown regulator of glucose metabolism. Mdt1 regulates glucose assimilation downstream of Tps1 and is necessary for nutrient utilization, sporulation, and pathogenicity. This is the first functional characterization of a MATE-family protein in filamentous fungi and the first description of a MATE protein in genetic regulation or plant pathogenicity. Perturbing CCR in Δtps1 and MDT1 disruption strains thus results in physiological defects that impact pathogenesis, possibly through the early expression of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Taken together, the importance of discovering three new regulators of carbon metabolism lies in understanding how M. oryzae and other pathogenic fungi respond to nutrient availability and control development during infection.",understanding genetic pathway regulate pathogenic fungi respond environment paramount developing effective mitigation strategy disease carbon catabolite repression ccr global regulatory mechanism found wide range microbial organism ensures preferential utilization glucose less favourable carbon source little known component ccr filamentous fungi report three new mediator ccr devastating rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae sugar sensor tps nmr inhibitor protein multidrug toxin extrusion matefamily pump mdt using simple plate test coupled transcriptional analysis show tps response glucosephosphate sensing trigger ccr via inactivation nmr addition dissecting ccr pathway using agrobacterium tumefaciensmediated mutagenesis also show mdt additional previously unknown regulator glucose metabolism mdt regulates glucose assimilation downstream tps necessary nutrient utilization sporulation pathogenicity first functional characterization matefamily protein filamentous fungi first description mate protein genetic regulation plant pathogenicity perturbing ccr δtps mdt disruption strain thus result physiological defect impact pathogenesis possibly early expression cell walldegrading enzyme taken together importance discovering three new regulator carbon metabolism lie understanding oryzae pathogenic fungi respond nutrient availability control development infection,3,"{'Disease': ['effective mitigation strategy disease carbon'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective mitigation strategy disease carbon', 'physiological defect impact pathogenesis']}",9

32630695,Knockout of <i>Pi21</i> by CRISPR/Cas9 and iTRAQ-Based Proteomic Analysis of Mutants Revealed New Insights into <i>M. oryzae</i> Resistance in Elite Rice Line.,"Rice blast (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) is a devastating disease affecting rice production globally. The development of cultivars with host resistance has been proved to be the best strategy for disease management. Several rice-resistance genes (R) have been recognized which induce resistance to blast in rice but R gene-mediated mechanisms resulting in defense response still need to be elucidated. Here, mutant lines generated through CRISPR/Cas9 based targeted mutagenesis to investigate the role of <i>Pi21</i> against blast resistance and 17 mutant plants were obtained in T<sub>0</sub> generation with the mutation rate of 66% including 26% bi-allelic, 22% homozygous, 12% heterozygous, and 3% chimeric and 17 T-DNA-free lines in T<sub>1</sub> generation. The homozygous mutant lines revealed enhanced resistance to blast without affecting the major agronomic traits. Furthermore, comparative proteome profiling was adopted to study the succeeding proteomic regulations, using iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis. We identified 372 DEPs, among them 149 up and 223 were down-regulated, respectively. GO analysis revealed that the proteins related to response to stimulus, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolic process, and small molecule metabolic process were up-regulated.

23031077,Transgenic rice with inducible ethylene production exhibits broad-spectrum disease resistance to the fungal pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani.,"Rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) are the two most devastating diseases of rice (Oryza sativa), and have severe impacts on crop yield and grain quality. Recent evidence suggests that ethylene (ET) may play a more prominent role than salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in mediating rice disease resistance. In this study, we attempt to genetically manipulate endogenous ET levels in rice for enhancing resistance to rice blast and sheath blight diseases. Transgenic lines with inducible production of ET were generated by expressing the rice ACS2 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase, a key enzyme of ET biosynthesis) transgene under control of a strong pathogen-inducible promoter. In comparison with the wild-type plant, the OsACS2-overexpression lines showed significantly increased levels of the OsACS2 transcripts, endogenous ET and defence gene expression, especially in response to pathogen infection. More importantly, the transgenic lines exhibited increased resistance to a field isolate of R. solani, as well as different races of M. oryzae. Assessment of the growth rate, generational time and seed production revealed little or no differences between wild type and transgenic lines. These results suggest that pathogen-inducible production of ET in transgenic rice can enhance resistance to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens without negatively impacting crop productivity.",rice blast magnaporthe oryzae sheath blight rhizoctonia solani two devastating disease rice oryza sativa severe impact crop yield grain quality recent evidence suggests ethylene et may play prominent role salicylic acid jasmonic acid mediating rice disease resistance study attempt genetically manipulate endogenous et level rice enhancing resistance rice blast sheath blight disease transgenic line inducible production et generated expressing rice ac aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid synthase key enzyme et biosynthesis transgene control strong pathogeninducible promoter comparison wildtype plant osacsoverexpression line showed significantly increased level osacs transcript endogenous et defence gene expression especially response pathogen infection importantly transgenic line exhibited increased resistance field isolate r solani well different race oryzae assessment growth rate generational time seed production revealed little difference wild type transgenic line result suggest pathogeninducible production et transgenic rice enhance resistance necrotrophic hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen without negatively impacting crop productivity,4,"{'Disease': ['two devastating disease rice oryza sativa', 'rice disease resistance study attempt', 'resistance rice blast sheath blight disease transgenic line inducible production et'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['negatively impacting crop productivity']}",7

Here we used candidate defense response (DR) genes to dissect quantitative resistance in rice using recombinant inbred (RI) and advanced backcross (BC) populations derived from a blast-resistant cultivar, Sanhuangzhan 2 (SHZ-2). Based on DNA profiles of DR genes, RI lines were clustered into two groups corresponding to level of resistance. Five DR genes, encoding putative oxalate oxidase, dehydrin, PR-1, chitinase, and 14-3-3 protein, accounted for 30.0, 23.0, 15.8, 6.7, and 5.5% of diseased leaf area (DLA) variation, respectively. Together, they accounted for 60.3% of the DLA variation and co-localized with resistance QTL identified by interval mapping. Average phenotypic contributions of oxalate oxidase, dehydrin, PR-1, chitinase, and 14-3-3 protein in BC lines were 26.1, 19.0, 18.0, 11.5, and 10.6%, respectively, across environments.

20849575,Preformed expression of defense is a hallmark of partial resistance to rice blast fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Partial resistance to plant pathogens is extensively used in breeding programs since it could contribute to resistance durability. Partial resistance often builds up during plant development and confers quantitative and usually broad-spectrum resistance. However, very little is known on the mechanisms underlying partial resistance. Partial resistance is often explained by poorly effective induction of plant defense systems. By exploring rice natural diversity, we asked whether expression of defense systems before infection could explain partial resistance towards the major fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. The constitutive expression of 21 defense-related genes belonging to the defense system was monitored in 23 randomly sampled rice cultivars for which partial resistance was measured. We identified a strong correlation between the expression of defense-related genes before infection and partial resistance. Only a weak correlation was found between the induction of defense genes and partial resistance. Increasing constitutive expression of defense-related genes also correlated with the establishment of partial resistance during plant development. Some rice genetic sub-groups displayed a particular pattern of constitutive expression, suggesting a strong natural polymorphism for constitutive expression of defense. Constitutive levels of hormones like salicylic acid and ethylene cannot explain constitutive expression of defense. We could identify an area of the genome that contributes to explain both preformed defense and partial resistance. These results indicate that constitutive expression of defense-related genes is likely responsible for a large part of partial resistance in rice. The finding of this preformed defense system should help guide future breeding programs and open the possibility to identify the molecular mechanisms behind partial resistance.",partial resistance plant pathogen extensively used breeding program since could contribute resistance durability partial resistance often build plant development confers quantitative usually broadspectrum resistance however little known mechanism underlying partial resistance partial resistance often explained poorly effective induction plant defense system exploring rice natural diversity asked whether expression defense system infection could explain partial resistance towards major fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae constitutive expression defenserelated gene belonging defense system monitored randomly sampled rice cultivar partial resistance measured identified strong correlation expression defenserelated gene infection partial resistance weak correlation found induction defense gene partial resistance increasing constitutive expression defenserelated gene also correlated establishment partial resistance plant development rice genetic subgroup displayed particular pattern constitutive expression suggesting strong natural polymorphism constitutive expression defense constitutive level hormone like salicylic acid ethylene explain constitutive expression defense could identify area genome contributes explain preformed defense partial resistance result indicate constitutive expression defenserelated gene likely responsible large part partial resistance rice finding preformed defense system help guide future breeding program open possibility identify molecular mechanism behind partial resistance,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['poorly effective induction plant defense system']}",2
25261161,Phenotypic expression of blast resistance gene Pi54 is not affected by its chromosomal position.,"This is a novel report in which chromosomal position of the rice blast resistance gene Pi54 was not found to affect significantly the resistance phenotype or morphological traits. Blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is a serious constraint in rice production at global level. Pi54 gene imparts resistance against M. oryzae. Three different transgenic lines containing Pi54 and its orthologue Pi54rh were shown to be resistant to different races of M. oryzae. To determine the chromosomal location of Pi54 gene in transgenic lines, inverse PCR was performed. Our analysis showed that in two transgenic lines, Pi54 gene was integrated on chromosomes 6 and 10 at 12.94 and 22.30 Mb, respectively. Similarly, Pi54rh allele was integrated on chromosome 1 at 16.25 Mb. The Pi54 gene present on chromosome 6 was located in a non-coding region whereas in the other TP-Pi54 line, the gene was introgressed on chromosome 10 in between the coding region of SAP domain gene. The Pi54rh was also located in the non coding region flanked by the retrotransposon genes. These rice lines were evaluated for eight different traits related to seed and plant morphology and agronomic features for two consecutive years. The transgenic lines containing Pi54 gene have higher tiller number, grain weight, epicotyl length, and yield compared to the non-transgenic control. Multivariate correlation analysis shows that blast resistance was positively correlated with the number of tillers; thousand grain weight and epicotyl length.

23347338,Identification of rice Allene Oxide Cyclase mutants and the function of jasmonate for defence against Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Two photomorphogenic mutants of rice, coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) and hebiba, were found to be defective in the gene encoding allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) by map-based cloning and complementation assays. Examination of the enzymatic activity of recombinant GST-OsAOC indicated that OsAOC is a functional enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and related compounds. The level of jasmonate was extremely low in both mutants, in agreement with the fact that rice has only one gene encoding allene oxide cyclase. Several flower-related mutant phenotypes were observed, including morphological abnormalities of the flower and early flowering. We used these mutants to investigate the function of jasmonate in the defence response to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Inoculation assays with fungal spores revealed that both mutants are more susceptible than wild-type to an incompatible strain of M. oryzae, in such a way that hyphal growth was enhanced in mutant tissues. The level of jasmonate isoleucine, a bioactive form of jasmonate, increased in response to blast infection.

Northern blot demonstrated that the gene is expressed not only in blast-infected rice leaves, but also in low temperature-treated rice. In addition, the expressed protein in Escherichia coli exhibits strong antifreeze activities. The gene was overexpressed in rice plants transformed via Agrobacterium tumefacient EHA105. Overall 112 T0 transformants were obtained in this research. Cold tolerance and disease resistance of T1 transformants were, respectively, investigated. The results showed that plants containing overexpressed transgene can withstand -1 degrees C for 24 h without severe chilling injury after thawed, and that disease symptoms of the parallel transformants are highly reduced in response to blast infection, when compared with controls. The relationship of the gene and several pathogenesis-related protein genes to be chosen was analyzed and discussed.

Nipponbare, when challenged with two independent blast isolates. The chromosomal location of this monogenic resistance was mapped to a region of the long arm of chromosome 12 by bulk segregant analysis, using 180 evenly distributed SSR markers. Five additional SSR loci and nine newly developed PCR-based markers allowed the target region to be reduced to ca. 1.8 cM, equivalent in Nipponbare to about 800 kb. In the reference sequence of Nipponbare, this region includes an NBS-LRR cluster of four genes. The known blast resistance gene Pi-GD-3 also maps in this region, but the 93-11 resistance was distinguishable from Pi-GD-3 on the basis of race specificity. We have therefore named the 93-11 resistance Pi41.

27671120,Ethylene Biosynthesis and Signaling Is Required for Rice Immune Response and Basal Resistance Against Magnaporthe oryzae Infection.,"Recent studies have suggested that ethylene enhances host resistance to fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Among the six 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase genes in rice, OsACS1 and OsACS2 are induced within 24 h of inoculation by M. oryzae. This induction occurs simultaneously with an increase in ethylene production that is noticeable 12 h postinoculation. The purpose of this study was to examine the dynamics of ethylene production and signaling in wild type and RNA interference-mediated suppression lines deficient in ethylene production (acs2) or signaling (eil1) after challenge with M. oryzae as well as fungal cell-wall elicitors. Ethylene-insensitive mutant lines show an attenuated basal defense response including lower basal expression of the genes encoding a chitin-binding receptor, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and the enzymes involved in the synthesis of diterprenoid phytoalexins, a reduction on early hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death, and reduced incidence of callose deposition. Ethylene-deficient mutants showed an intermediate phenotype, with a significant reduction in expression of defense-related genes and callose deposition, but only a slight reduction in HR-like cell death. As a result, all ethylene-insensitive mutants show increased susceptibility to M. oryzae, whereas the ethylene-deficient lines show a slight but less significant increase in disease severity. These results show that ethylene signaling and, to some extent, ethylene production are required for rice basal resistance against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.",recent study suggested ethylene enhances host resistance fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease among six aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid synthase gene rice osacs osacs induced within h inoculation oryzae induction occurs simultaneously increase ethylene production noticeable h postinoculation purpose study examine dynamic ethylene production signaling wild type rna interferencemediated suppression line deficient ethylene production ac signaling eil challenge oryzae well fungal cellwall elicitors ethyleneinsensitive mutant line show attenuated basal defense response including lower basal expression gene encoding chitinbinding receptor pathogenesisrelated pr protein enzyme involved synthesis diterprenoid phytoalexins reduction early hypersensitive response hrlike cell death reduced incidence callose deposition ethylenedeficient mutant showed intermediate phenotype significant reduction expression defenserelated gene callose deposition slight reduction hrlike cell death result ethyleneinsensitive mutant show increased susceptibility oryzae whereas ethylenedeficient line show slight less significant increase disease severity result show ethylene signaling extent ethylene production required rice basal resistance blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae,4,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease', 'rice basal resistance blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",11
17517758,Probenazole-induced accumulation of salicylic acid confers resistance to Magnaporthe grisea in adult rice plants.,"Probenazole (PBZ) is the active ingredient of Oryzemate, an agrochemical which is used for the protection of rice plants from Magnaporthe grisea (blast fungus). While PBZ was reported to function upstream of salicylic acid (SA) in Arabidopsis, little is known about the mechanism of PBZ-induced resistance in rice. The role of SA in blast fungus resistance is also unclear. The recommended application period for Oryzemate is just before the Japanese rainy season, at which time rice plants in the field have reached the 8-leaf stage with adult traits. Thus, the involvement of SA in PBZ-induced resistance was studied in compatible and incompatible blast fungus-rice interactions at two developmentally different leaf morphology stages. Pre-treatment of inoculated fourth leaves of young wild-type rice plants at the 4-leaf stage with PBZ did not influence the development of whitish expanding lesions (ELs) in the susceptible interaction without the accumulation of SA and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. However, PBZ pre-treatment increased accumulation of SA and PR proteins in the eighth leaves of adult plants at the 8-leaf stage, resulting in the formation of hypersensitive reaction (HR) lesions (HRLs). Exogenous SA induced resistance in adult but not young plants. SA concentrations in blast fungus-inoculated young leaves were essentially the same in compatible and incompatible interactions, suggesting that PBZ-induced resistance in rice is age-dependently regulated via SA accumulation.",probenazole pbz active ingredient oryzemate agrochemical used protection rice plant magnaporthe grisea blast fungus pbz reported function upstream salicylic acid sa arabidopsis little known mechanism pbzinduced resistance rice role sa blast fungus resistance also unclear recommended application period oryzemate japanese rainy season time rice plant field reached leaf stage adult trait thus involvement sa pbzinduced resistance studied compatible incompatible blast fungusrice interaction two developmentally different leaf morphology stage pretreatment inoculated fourth leaf young wildtype rice plant leaf stage pbz influence development whitish expanding lesion el susceptible interaction without accumulation sa pathogenesisrelated pr protein however pbz pretreatment increased accumulation sa pr protein eighth leaf adult plant leaf stage resulting formation hypersensitive reaction hr lesion hrls exogenous sa induced resistance adult young plant sa concentration blast fungusinoculated young leaf essentially compatible incompatible interaction suggesting pbzinduced resistance rice agedependently regulated via sa accumulation,4,"{'Disease': ['grisea blast fungus pbz', 'resistance rice role sa blast fungus resistance', 'compatible incompatible blast fungusrice interaction'], 'Treatment': ['two developmentally different leaf morphology stage pretreatment'], 'Symptom': []}",11
38732268,OsCAMTA3 Negatively Regulates Disease Resistance to <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> by Associating with OsCAMTAPL in Rice.,"Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is one of the most important staple foods worldwide. However, rice blast disease, caused by the ascomycete fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, seriously affects the yield and quality of rice. Calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators (CAMTAs) play vital roles in the response to biotic stresses. In this study, we showed that OsCAMTA3 and CAMTA PROTEIN LIKE (OsCAMTAPL), an OsCAMTA3 homolog that lacks the DNA-binding domain, functioned together in negatively regulating disease resistance in rice. OsCAMTA3 associated with OsCAMTAPL. The <i>oscamta3</i> and <i>oscamtapl</i> mutants showed enhanced resistance compared to wild-type plants, and <i>oscamta3/pl</i> double mutants showed more robust resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i> than <i>oscamta3</i> or <i>oscamtapl</i>. An RNA-Seq analysis revealed that 59 and 73 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed in wild-type plants and <i>oscamta3</i> before and after inoculation with <i>M. oryzae</i>, including <i>OsALDH2B1</i>, an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase that negatively regulates plant immunity. OsCAMTA3 could directly bind to the promoter of <i>OsALDH2B1</i>, and <i>OsALDH2B1</i> expression was decreased in <i>oscamta3</i>, <i>oscamtapl</i>, and <i>oscamta3/pl</i> mutants.

18357468,Rice lesion mimic mutants with enhanced resistance to diseases.,"Lesion mimic mutants are characterized by the formation of necrotic lesions in the absence of pathogens. Such genetic defects often result in enhanced resistance to pathogen infection and constitutive expression of defense response genes. To understand the genetic mechanisms leading to these mutations, we characterized 21 lesion mimic mutants isolated from IR64 rice mutant populations produced by mutagenesis with diepoxybutane (D), gamma rays (G), and fast neutrons (F). Four mutations are controlled by single dominant genes, one of which is inherited maternally. Five lesion mimics are allelic to known spotted leaf (spl) mutants spl1, spl2, spl3, or spl6. In total, 11 new lesion mimic mutations, named spl16, spl17, and spl19 through Spl27, were established based on allelism tests. Two lesion mimics, spl17 and Spl26 showed enhanced resistance to multiple strains of Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast pathogen, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the bacterial blight (BB) pathogen. Co-segregation analyses of blast and BB resistance and lesion mimic phenotypes in segregating populations of spl17 and Spl26 indicate that enhanced resistance to the two diseases is conferred by mutations in the lesion mimic genes. A double mutant produced from two independent lesion mimics showed more severe lesions and higher level of resistance to X. o. pv. oryzae than their single mutant parents indicating a synergistic effect of the two mutations. In mutants that exhibit enhanced disease resistance to both pathogens, increases in expression of defense response genes PR-10a, POX22.3, and PO-C1 were correlated with lesion mimic development and enhancement of resistance. These lesion mimic mutants may provide essential materials for a comprehensive dissection of the disease resistance pathways in rice.",lesion mimic mutant characterized formation necrotic lesion absence pathogen genetic defect often result enhanced resistance pathogen infection constitutive expression defense response gene understand genetic mechanism leading mutation characterized lesion mimic mutant isolated ir rice mutant population produced mutagenesis diepoxybutane gamma ray g fast neutron f four mutation controlled single dominant gene one inherited maternally five lesion mimic allelic known spotted leaf spl mutant spl spl spl spl total new lesion mimic mutation named spl spl spl spl established based allelism test two lesion mimic spl spl showed enhanced resistance multiple strain magnaporthe oryzae rice blast pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae bacterial blight bb pathogen cosegregation analysis blast bb resistance lesion mimic phenotype segregating population spl spl indicate enhanced resistance two disease conferred mutation lesion mimic gene double mutant produced two independent lesion mimic showed severe lesion higher level resistance x pv oryzae single mutant parent indicating synergistic effect two mutation mutant exhibit enhanced disease resistance pathogen increase expression defense response gene pra pox poc correlated lesion mimic development enhancement resistance lesion mimic mutant may provide essential material comprehensive dissection disease resistance pathway rice,8,"{'Disease': ['enhanced resistance two disease conferred mutation lesion mimic gene double mutant', 'essential material comprehensive dissection disease resistance pathway rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['synergistic effect']}",12
26603141,Serotonin attenuates biotic stress and leads to lesion browning caused by a hypersensitive response to Magnaporthe oryzae penetration in rice.,"The hypersensitive response (HR) of plants is one of the earliest responses to prevent pathogen invasion. A brown dot lesion on a leaf is visual evidence of the HR against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice, but tracking the browning process has been difficult. In this study, we induced the HR in rice cultivars harboring the blast resistance gene Pit by inoculation of an incompatible M. oryzae strain, which generated a unique resistance lesion with a brown ring (halo) around the brown fungal penetration site. Inoculation analysis using a plant harboring Pit but lacking an enzyme that catalyzes tryptamine to serotonin showed that high accumulation of the oxidized form of serotonin was the cause of the browning at the halo and penetration site. Our analysis of the halo browning process in the rice leaf revealed that abscisic acid enhanced biosynthesis of serotonin under light conditions, and serotonin changed to the oxidized form via hydrogen peroxide produced by light. The dramatic increase in serotonin, which has a high antioxidant activity, suppressed leaf damage outside the halo, blocked expansion of the browning area and attenuated inhibition of plant growth. These results suggest that serotonin helps to reduce biotic stress in the plant by acting as a scavenger of oxygen radicals to protect uninfected tissues from oxidative damage caused by the HR. The deposition of its oxide at the HR lesion is observed as lesion browning.",hypersensitive response hr plant one earliest response prevent pathogen invasion brown dot lesion leaf visual evidence hr blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae rice tracking browning process difficult study induced hr rice cultivar harboring blast resistance gene pit inoculation incompatible oryzae strain generated unique resistance lesion brown ring halo around brown fungal penetration site inoculation analysis using plant harboring pit lacking enzyme catalyzes tryptamine serotonin showed high accumulation oxidized form serotonin cause browning halo penetration site analysis halo browning process rice leaf revealed abscisic acid enhanced biosynthesis serotonin light condition serotonin changed oxidized form via hydrogen peroxide produced light dramatic increase serotonin high antioxidant activity suppressed leaf damage outside halo blocked expansion browning area attenuated inhibition plant growth result suggest serotonin help reduce biotic stress plant acting scavenger oxygen radical protect uninfected tissue oxidative damage caused hr deposition oxide hr lesion observed lesion browning,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
10487219,Chemical induction of disease resistance in rice is correlated with the expression of a gene encoding a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats.,"Probenazole (3-allyloxy-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide) is an agricultural chemical primarily used to prevent rice blast disease. Probenazole-treated rice acquires resistance to blast fungus irrespective of the rice variety. The chemical is applied prophylactically, and is thought to induce or bolster endogenous plant defenses. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been established. To understand the mode of the chemical's action, we screened for novel probenazole-responsive genes in rice by means of differential display and identified a candidate gene, RPR1. RPR1 contains a nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats, thus sharing structural similarity with known disease resistance genes. The expression of RPR1 in rice can be up-regulated by treatment with chemical inducers of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and by inoculation with pathogens. RPR1-related sequences in rice varieties seem to be varied in sequence and/or expression, indicating that RPR1 itself is not a crucial factor for induced resistance in rice. However, Southern blot analysis revealed the existence of homologous sequences in all varieties examined. While the role of RPR1 has yet to be clarified, this is the first report of the identification of a member of this gene class and its induction during the systemic expression of induced disease resistance.",probenazole allyloxybenzisothiazoledioxide agricultural chemical primarily used prevent rice blast disease probenazoletreated rice acquires resistance blast fungus irrespective rice variety chemical applied prophylactically thought induce bolster endogenous plant defense however mechanism underlying effect established understand mode chemical action screened novel probenazoleresponsive gene rice mean differential display identified candidate gene rpr rpr contains nucleotide binding site leucinerich repeat thus sharing structural similarity known disease resistance gene expression rpr rice upregulated treatment chemical inducer systemic acquired resistance sar inoculation pathogen rprrelated sequence rice variety seem varied sequence andor expression indicating rpr crucial factor induced resistance rice however southern blot analysis revealed existence homologous sequence variety examined role rpr yet clarified first report identification member gene class induction systemic expression induced disease resistance,4,"{'Disease': ['prevent rice blast disease', 'resistance blast fungus irrespective rice variety chemical', 'disease resistance gene expression rpr rice upregulated treatment chemical inducer', 'disease resistance'], 'Treatment': ['disease resistance gene expression rpr rice upregulated treatment chemical inducer'], 'Symptom': ['mechanism underlying effect']}",0
22442415,The rice ERF transcription factor OsERF922 negatively regulates resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and salt tolerance.,"Rice OsERF922, encoding an APETELA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) type transcription factor, is rapidly and strongly induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and salt treatments, as well as by both virulent and avirulent pathovars of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. OsERF922 is localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the GCC box sequence, and acts as a transcriptional activator in plant cells. Knockdown of OsERF922 by means of RNAi enhanced resistance against M. oryzae. The elevated disease resistance of the RNAi plants was associated with increased expression of PR, PAL, and the other genes encoding phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes and without M. oryzae infection. In contrast, OsERF922-overexpressing plants showed reduced expression of these defence-related genes and enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae. In addition, the OsERF922-overexpressing lines exhibited decreased tolerance to salt stress with an increased Na(+)/K(+) ratio in the shoots. The ABA levels were found increased in the overexpressing lines and decreased in the RNAi plants. Expression of the ABA biosynthesis-related genes, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) 3 and 4, was upregulated in the OsERF922-overexpressing plants, and NCED4 was downregulated in the RNAi lines. These results suggest that OsERF922 is integrated into the cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress-signalling networks perhaps through modulation of the ABA levels.",rice oserf encoding apetelaethylene response factor aperf type transcription factor rapidly strongly induced abscisic acid aba salt treatment well virulent avirulent pathovars magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease oserf localized nucleus bind specifically gcc box sequence act transcriptional activator plant cell knockdown oserf mean rnai enhanced resistance oryzae elevated disease resistance rnai plant associated increased expression pr pal gene encoding phytoalexin biosynthetic enzyme without oryzae infection contrast oserfoverexpressing plant showed reduced expression defencerelated gene enhanced susceptibility oryzae addition oserfoverexpressing line exhibited decreased tolerance salt stress increased nak ratio shoot aba level found increased overexpressing line decreased rnai plant expression aba biosynthesisrelated gene cisepoxycarotenoid dioxygenase nced upregulated oserfoverexpressing plant nced downregulated rnai line result suggest oserf integrated crosstalk biotic abiotic stresssignalling network perhaps modulation aba level,4,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease oserf localized nucleus bind', 'act transcriptional activator plant cell knockdown oserf mean rnai enhanced resistance oryzae elevated disease resistance rnai plant associated increased expression pr pal gene'], 'Treatment': ['abscisic acid aba salt treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",7
21283781,Multiple plant surface signals are sensed by different mechanisms in the rice blast fungus for appressorium formation.,"Surface recognition and penetration are among the most critical plant infection processes in foliar pathogens. In Magnaporthe oryzae, the Pmk1 MAP kinase regulates appressorium formation and penetration. Its orthologs also are known to be required for various plant infection processes in other phytopathogenic fungi. Although a number of upstream components of this important pathway have been characterized, the upstream sensors for surface signals have not been well characterized. Pmk1 is orthologous to Kss1 in yeast that functions downstream from Msb2 and Sho1 for filamentous growth. Because of the conserved nature of the Pmk1 and Kss1 pathways and reduced expression of MoMSB2 in the pmk1 mutant, in this study we functionally characterized the MoMSB2 and MoSHO1 genes. Whereas the Momsb2 mutant was significantly reduced in appressorium formation and virulence, the Mosho1 mutant was only slightly reduced. The Mosho1 Momsb2 double mutant rarely formed appressoria on artificial hydrophobic surfaces, had a reduced Pmk1 phosphorylation level, and was nonresponsive to cutin monomers. However, it still formed appressoria and caused rare, restricted lesions on rice leaves. On artificial hydrophilic surfaces, leaf surface waxes and primary alcohols-but not paraffin waxes and alkanes- stimulated appressorium formation in the Mosho1 Momsb2 mutant, but more efficiently in the Momsb2 mutant. Furthermore, expression of a dominant active MST7 allele partially suppressed the defects of the Momsb2 mutant. These results indicate that, besides surface hydrophobicity and cutin monomers, primary alcohols, a major component of epicuticular leaf waxes in grasses, are recognized by M. oryzae as signals for appressorium formation. Our data also suggest that MoMsb2 and MoSho1 may have overlapping functions in recognizing various surface signals for Pmk1 activation and appressorium formation. While MoMsb2 is critical for sensing surface hydrophobicity and cutin monomers, MoSho1 may play a more important role in recognizing rice leaf waxes.",surface recognition penetration among critical plant infection process foliar pathogen magnaporthe oryzae pmk map kinase regulates appressorium formation penetration orthologs also known required various plant infection process phytopathogenic fungi although number upstream component important pathway characterized upstream sensor surface signal well characterized pmk orthologous ks yeast function downstream msb sho filamentous growth conserved nature pmk ks pathway reduced expression momsb pmk mutant study functionally characterized momsb mosho gene whereas momsb mutant significantly reduced appressorium formation virulence mosho mutant slightly reduced mosho momsb double mutant rarely formed appressoria artificial hydrophobic surface reduced pmk phosphorylation level nonresponsive cutin monomer however still formed appressoria caused rare restricted lesion rice leaf artificial hydrophilic surface leaf surface wax primary alcoholsbut paraffin wax alkane stimulated appressorium formation mosho momsb mutant efficiently momsb mutant furthermore expression dominant active mst allele partially suppressed defect momsb mutant result indicate besides surface hydrophobicity cutin monomer primary alcohol major component epicuticular leaf wax grass recognized oryzae signal appressorium formation data also suggest momsb mosho may overlapping function recognizing various surface signal pmk activation appressorium formation momsb critical sensing surface hydrophobicity cutin monomer mosho may play important role recognizing rice leaf wax,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",11

Prepared fractions of secretory proteins were essentially free from cytoplasmic contamination. Two-DGE and MudPIT identified 732 secretory proteins, where 291 (40%) and 441 (60%) proteins were derived from rice and M. oryzae, respectively. Of these, 39.2% (rice) and 38.9% (M. oryzae) of proteins were predicted by SignalP as retaining signal peptides. Among these, rice secreted more proteins related to stress response, ROS and energy metabolism, whereas, M. oryzae secreted more proteins involved in metabolism and cell wall hydrolyses. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed their differential expression under compatible/incompatible interactions. In vivo expression of M. oryzae glycosyl hydrolase (GH) protein family members using particle bombardment driven transient expression system showed that four GH genes could act as effectors within host apoplast possibly via interaction with host membrane bound receptor.

39665688,Phosphorylation of the transcription factor OsNAC29 by OsMAPK3 activates diterpenoid genes to promote rice immunity.,"Well-conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are essential for orchestrating of a wide range of cellular processes in plants, including defense responses against pathogen attack. NAC transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in plant immunity, but their targets and how they are regulated remain largely unknown. Here, we identified the TF OsNAC29 as a key component of a MAPK signaling pathway involved in rice (Oryza sativa) disease resistance. OsNAC29 binds directly to CACGTG motifs in the promoters of OsTPS28 and OsCYP71Z2, which are crucial for the biosynthesis of the phytoalexin 5,10-diketo-casbene and consequently rice blast resistance. OsNAC29 positively regulates rice blast resistance by promoting the expression of of OsTPS28 and OsCYP71Z2, and the function of OsNAC29 is genetically dependent on OsCYP71Z2 and OsTPS28. Furthermore, OsNAC29 interacts with OsRACK1A and OsMAPK3/6 to form an immune complex; OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsNAC29 at Thr304 to prevent its proteasome-mediated degradation and promote its function against rice blast fungus. Phosphorylation of OsNAC29 at Thr304 is induced upon Magnaporthe oryzae infection and chitin treatment.

Despite its scientific and economic importance, the phylogenetic position of Magnaporthales within Sordariomycetes and the interrelationships of its constituent taxa, remain controversial. In this study, we generated novel transcriptome data from 21 taxa that represent key Magnaporthales lineages of different infection and nutrition modes and phenotypes. Phylogenomic analysis of >200 conserved genes allowed the reconstruction of a robust Sordariomycetes tree of life that placed the monophyletic group of Magnaporthales sister to Ophiostomatales. Among Magnaporthales, three major clades were recognized: 1) an early diverging clade A comprised of saprotrophs associated with submerged woods; 2) clade B that includes the rice blast fungus and other pathogens that cause blast diseases of monocot plants. These species infect the above-ground tissues of host plants using the penetration structure, appressorium; and 3) clade C comprised primarily of root-associated species that penetrate the root tissue with hyphopodia.

25553855,Recurrent parent genome recovery analysis in a marker-assisted backcrossing program of rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Backcross breeding is the most commonly used method for incorporating a blast resistance gene into a rice cultivar. Linkage between the resistance gene and undesirable units can persist for many generations of backcrossing. Marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) along with marker-assisted selection (MAS) contributes immensely to overcome the main limitation of the conventional breeding and accelerates recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery. The MABC approach was employed to incorporate (a) blast resistance gene(s) from the donor parent Pongsu Seribu 1, the blast-resistant local variety in Malaysia, into the genetic background of MR219, a popular high-yielding rice variety that is blast susceptible, to develop a blast-resistant MR219 improved variety. In this perspective, the recurrent parent genome recovery was analyzed in early generations of backcrossing using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Out of 375 SSR markers, 70 markers were found polymorphic between the parents, and these markers were used to evaluate the plants in subsequent generations. Background analysis revealed that the extent of RPG recovery ranged from 75.40% to 91.3% and from 80.40% to 96.70% in BC1F1 and BC2F1 generations, respectively. In this study, the recurrent parent genome content in the selected BC2F2 lines ranged from 92.7% to 97.7%. The average proportion of the recurrent parent in the selected improved line was 95.98%. MAS allowed identification of the plants that are more similar to the recurrent parent for the loci evaluated in backcross generations. The application of MAS with the MABC breeding program accelerated the recovery of the RP genome, reducing the number of generations and the time for incorporating resistance against rice blast.",backcross breeding commonly used method incorporating blast resistance gene rice cultivar linkage resistance gene undesirable unit persist many generation backcrossing markerassisted backcrossing mabc along markerassisted selection ma contributes immensely overcome main limitation conventional breeding accelerates recurrent parent genome rpg recovery mabc approach employed incorporate blast resistance gene donor parent pongsu seribu blastresistant local variety malaysia genetic background mr popular highyielding rice variety blast susceptible develop blastresistant mr improved variety perspective recurrent parent genome recovery analyzed early generation backcrossing using simple sequence repeat ssr marker ssr marker marker found polymorphic parent marker used evaluate plant subsequent generation background analysis revealed extent rpg recovery ranged bcf bcf generation respectively study recurrent parent genome content selected bcf line ranged average proportion recurrent parent selected improved line ma allowed identification plant similar recurrent parent locus evaluated backcross generation application ma mabc breeding program accelerated recovery rp genome reducing number generation time incorporating resistance rice blast,5,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['method'], 'Symptom': []}",13
17115220,Molecular mapping of two cultivar-specific avirulence genes in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is a globally important disease of rice that causes annual yield losses. The segregation of genes controlling the virulence of M. grisea on rice was studied to establish the genetic basis of cultivar specificity in the interaction of rice and M. grisea. The segregation of avirulence and virulence was studied in 87 M. grisea F(1) progeny isolates from a cross of two isolates, Guy11 and JS153, using resistance-gene-differential rice cultivars. The segregation ratio indicated that avirulence and virulence in the rice cultivars Aichi-asahi and K59, respectively, are controlled by single major genes. Genetic analyses of backcrosses and full-sib crosses in these populations were also performed. The chi(2 )test of goodness-of-fitness for a 1:1 ratio indicated that one dominant gene controls avirulence in Aichi-asahi and K59 in this population. Based on the resistance reactions of rice differential lines harboring known resistance genes to the parental isolates, two genetically independent avirulence genes, AVR-Pit and AVR-Pia, were identified. Genetic linkage analysis showed that the SSR marker m355-356 is closely linked to AVR-Pit, on the telomere of chromosome 1 at a distance of approximately 2.3 cM. The RAPD marker S487, which was converted to a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker, was found to be closely linked to AVR-Pia, on the chromosome 7 telomere at a distance of 3.5 cM.

23234404,Cytokinins act synergistically with salicylic acid to activate defense gene expression in rice.,"Hormone crosstalk is pivotal in plant-pathogen interactions. Here, we report on the accumulation of cytokinins (CK) in rice seedlings after infection of blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and its potential significance in rice-M. oryzae interaction. Blast infection to rice seedlings increased levels of N(6)-(Δ(2)-isopentenyl) adenine (iP), iP riboside (iPR), and iPR 5'-phosphates (iPRP) in leaf blades. Consistent with this, CK signaling was activated around the infection sites, as shown by histochemical staining for β-glucuronidase activity driven by a CK-responsive OsRR6 promoter. Diverse CK species were also detected in the hyphae (mycelium), conidia, and culture filtrates of blast fungus, indicating that M. oryzae is capable of production as well as hyphal secretion of CK. Co-treatment of leaf blades with CK and salicylic acid (SA), but not with either one alone, markedly induced pathogenesis-related genes OsPR1b and probenazole-induced protein 1 (PBZ1). These effects were diminished by RNAi-knockdown of OsNPR1 or WRKY45, the key regulators of the SA signaling pathway in rice, indicating that the effects of CK depend on these two regulators. Taken together, our data imply a coevolutionary rice-M. oryzae interaction, wherein M. oryzae probably elevates rice CK levels for its own benefits such as nutrient translocation. Rice plants, on the other hand, sense it as an infection signal and activate defense reactions through the synergistic action with SA.",hormone crosstalk pivotal plantpathogen interaction report accumulation cytokinin ck rice seedling infection blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae potential significance ricem oryzae interaction blast infection rice seedling increased level nδisopentenyl adenine ip ip riboside ipr ipr phosphate iprp leaf blade consistent ck signaling activated around infection site shown histochemical staining βglucuronidase activity driven ckresponsive osrr promoter diverse ck specie also detected hypha mycelium conidium culture filtrate blast fungus indicating oryzae capable production well hyphal secretion ck cotreatment leaf blade ck salicylic acid sa either one alone markedly induced pathogenesisrelated gene osprb probenazoleinduced protein pbz effect diminished rnaiknockdown osnpr wrky key regulator sa signaling pathway rice indicating effect ck depend two regulator taken together data imply coevolutionary ricem oryzae interaction wherein oryzae probably elevates rice ck level benefit nutrient translocation rice plant hand sense infection signal activate defense reaction synergistic action sa,4,"{'Disease': ['hypha mycelium conidium culture filtrate blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['protein pbz effect', 'effect']}",7

However, most attempts to reach this goal fail as a result of rapid changes in pathogen populations and the sheer diversity of pathogen infection mechanisms. In this study, we show that the expression of a harpin-encoding gene (hrf1), derived from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, confers nonspecific resistance in rice to the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. Transgenic plants and their T1-T7 progenies were highly resistant to all major M. grisea races in rice-growing areas along the Yangtze River, China. The expression of defence-related genes was activated in resistant transgenic plants, and the formation of melanized appressoria, which is essential for foliar infection, was inhibited on plant leaves. These results suggest that harpins may offer new opportunities for generating broad-spectrum disease resistance in other crops.",engineering durable nonspecific resistance phytopathogens one ultimate goal plant breeding however attempt reach goal fail result rapid change pathogen population sheer diversity pathogen infection mechanism study show expression harpinencoding gene hrf derived xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae confers nonspecific resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea transgenic plant tt progeny highly resistant major grisea race ricegrowing area along yangtze river china expression defencerelated gene activated resistant transgenic plant formation melanized appressoria essential foliar infection inhibited plant leaf result suggest harpins may offer new opportunity generating broadspectrum disease resistance crop,8,"{'Disease': ['nonspecific resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea transgenic plant tt', 'new opportunity generating broadspectrum disease resistance crop'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
15968510,Rice SERK1 gene positively regulates somatic embryogenesis of cultured cell and host defense response against fungal infection.,"Here we report on the isolation and characterization of a somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (OsSERK1) gene in rice (Oryza sativa). The OsSERK1 gene belongs to a small subfamily of receptor-like kinase genes in rice and shares a highly conserved gene structure and extensive sequence homology with previously reported plant SERK genes. Though it has a basal level of expression in various rice organs/tissues, as high expression level was detected in rice callus during somatic embryogenesis. Suppression of OsSERK1 expression in transgenic calli by RNA interference resulted in a significant reduction of shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 14% in the japonica rice Zhonghua11). Overexpression of OsSERK1, however, increased the shoot regeneration rate (from 72% to 86%). Interestingly, OsSERK1 is significantly activated by the rice blast fungus, particularly during the incompatible interaction, and is associated with host cell death in Sekigushi lesion mimic mutants. This gene is also inducible by defense signaling molecules such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid. Furthermore, constitutive overexpression of OsSERK1 in two rice cultivars led to an increase in host resistance to the blast fungus. Our data suggest that OsSERK1 may partially mediate defense signal transduction in addition to its basic role in somatic embryogenesis.",report isolation characterization somatic embryogenesis receptorlike kinase osserk gene rice oryza sativa osserk gene belongs small subfamily receptorlike kinase gene rice share highly conserved gene structure extensive sequence homology previously reported plant serk gene though basal level expression various rice organstissues high expression level detected rice callus somatic embryogenesis suppression osserk expression transgenic callus rna interference resulted significant reduction shoot regeneration rate japonica rice zhonghua overexpression osserk however increased shoot regeneration rate interestingly osserk significantly activated rice blast fungus particularly incompatible interaction associated host cell death sekigushi lesion mimic mutant gene also inducible defense signaling molecule salicylic acid jasmonic acid abscisic acid furthermore constitutive overexpression osserk two rice cultivar led increase host resistance blast fungus data suggest osserk may partially mediate defense signal transduction addition basic role somatic embryogenesis,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus', 'host resistance blast fungus data'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

In this study, we found that the expression of <i>mohrip1</i> was significantly induced in the stages of fungal penetration and colonization. Although dispensable for the growth and conidiation, MoHrip1 was necessary for the full virulence of <i>M. oryzae</i>. Deletion of <i>mohrip1</i> remarkably compromised fungal virulence on rice seedlings and even on rice leaves with wounds. Rice sheath inoculation assay further demonstrated the defects of <i>mohrip1</i>-deleted mutants on penetration and proliferation in rice cells.

19405028,Identification of elicitor-responsive proteins in rice leaves by a proteomic approach.,"Experiments were conducted to identify the differentially expressed proteins in rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants after treatment with the glycoprotein elicitor CSB I, purified from ZC(13), a race of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. The interactions of two near isogenic lines of rice, C101A51 and CO39, with ZC(13) resulted in completely incompatible and compatible types, respectively. Proteins were extracted from rice leaves at 12 and 24 h after treatment with CSB I. Temporal changes in total proteins were examined using 2-DE. Among more than 900 protein spots reproducibly detected on each gel, 11 were up-regulated, three were down-regulated and seven were newly induced during, at a minimum, one time point. Twenty-one differentially expressed proteins were identified by linear ion trap quadrupole (LTQ)-MS/MS. The identified proteins were classified into six categories based on their putative function reported: (i) defense proteins (PR-10a, PR-5 and putative salt-induced protein), (ii) signal transduction (nucleoside diphosphate kinase and putative profilin), (iii) ROS (Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, GST and CAT), (iv) programmed cell death (translationally controlled tumor protein), (v) molecule biosynthesis (putative ribosomal protein S5, putative ribosomal protein L12, putative translational elongation factor Tu and putative chaperonin 21 precursor) and (vi) metabolism (putative fructose-bisphosphate aldolase class-I, putative malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase, putative acid phosphatase, putative transketolase1 and gamma hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase-like protein). All of these proteins (except Cu/Zn-SOD, putative acid phosphatase and translationally controlled tumor protein) were induced faster and to a higher degree in C101A51 than in CO39.

Direct comparison of the interactions between a single plant species and two closely-related (1) pathogenic and (2) mutualistic fungi species can improve our understanding of the evolution of the interactions between plants and fungi that lead to either mutualistic or pathogenic interactions. Differences in the metabolome and transcriptome of rice in response to challenge by H. or M. oryzae were investigated with GC-MS, RNA-seq, and qRT-PCR. Levels of metabolites of the shikimate and lignin biosynthesis pathways increased continuously in the M. oryzae-challenged rice roots (Mo-roots); these pathways were initially induced, but then suppressed, in the H. oryzae-challenged rice roots (Ho-roots). Compared to control samples, concentrations of sucrose and maltose were reduced in the Ho-roots and Mo-roots. The expression of most genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis and the TCA cycle were suppressed in the Ho-roots, but enhanced in the Mo-roots. The suppressed glycolysis in Ho-roots would result in the accumulation of glucose and fructose which was not detected in the Mo-roots.

35524572,APIP5 functions as a transcription factor and an RNA-binding protein to modulate cell death and immunity in rice.,"Many transcription factors (TFs) in animals bind to both DNA and mRNA, regulating transcription and mRNA turnover. However, whether plant TFs function at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels remains unknown. The rice (Oryza sativa) bZIP TF AVRPIZ-T-INTERACTING PROTEIN 5 (APIP5) negatively regulates programmed cell death and blast resistance and is targeted by the effector AvrPiz-t of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We demonstrate that the nuclear localization signal of APIP5 is essential for APIP5-mediated suppression of cell death and blast resistance. APIP5 directly targets two genes that positively regulate blast resistance: the cell wall-associated kinase gene OsWAK5 and the cytochrome P450 gene CYP72A1. APIP5 inhibits OsWAK5 expression and thus limits lignin accumulation; moreover, APIP5 inhibits CYP72A1 expression and thus limits reactive oxygen species production and defense compounds accumulation. Remarkably, APIP5 acts as an RNA-binding protein to regulate mRNA turnover of the cell death- and defense-related genes OsLSD1 and OsRac1. Therefore, APIP5 plays dual roles, acting as TF to regulate gene expression in the nucleus and as an RNA-binding protein to regulate mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm, a previously unidentified regulatory mechanism of plant TFs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.",many transcription factor tfs animal bind dna mrna regulating transcription mrna turnover however whether plant tfs function transcriptional posttranscriptional level remains unknown rice oryza sativa bzip tf avrpiztinteracting protein apip negatively regulates programmed cell death blast resistance targeted effector avrpizt blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae demonstrate nuclear localization signal apip essential apipmediated suppression cell death blast resistance apip directly target two gene positively regulate blast resistance cell wallassociated kinase gene oswak cytochrome p gene cypa apip inhibits oswak expression thus limit lignin accumulation moreover apip inhibits cypa expression thus limit reactive oxygen specie production defense compound accumulation remarkably apip act rnabinding protein regulate mrna turnover cell death defenserelated gene oslsd osrac therefore apip play dual role acting tf regulate gene expression nucleus rnabinding protein regulate mrna turnover cytoplasm previously unidentified regulatory mechanism plant tfs transcriptional posttranscriptional level,0,"{'Disease': ['cell death blast resistance targeted effector avrpizt blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['cell death blast resistance targeted effector avrpizt blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae']}",7

20924648,Role of OsNPR1 in rice defense program as revealed by genome-wide expression analysis.,"NPR1 is a central regulator of salicylic-acid (SA)-mediated defense signaling in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the characterization of OsNPR1, an Oryzae sativa (rice) ortholog of NPR1, focusing on its role in blast disease resistance and identification of OsNPR1-regulated genes. Blast resistance tests using OsNPR1 knockdown and overexpressing rice lines demonstrated the essential role of OsNPR1 in benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced blast resistance. Genome-wide transcript profiling using OsNPR1-knockdown lines revealed that 358 genes out of 1,228 BTH-upregulated genes and 724 genes out of 1,069 BTH-downregulated genes were OsNPR1-dependent with respect to BTH responsiveness, thereby indicating that OsNPR1 plays a more vital role in gene downregulation. The OsNPR1-dependently downregulated genes included many of those involved in photosynthesis and in chloroplast translation and transcription. Reduction of photosynthetic activity after BTH treatment and its negation by OsNPR1 knockdown were indeed reflected in the changes in Fv/Fm values in leaves. These results imply the role of OsNPR1 in the reallocation of energy and resources during defense responses.

39387827,The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsBSK1-2 regulates immunity via an HLH/bHLH complex.,"Plants need to fine-tune defense responses to maintain a robust but flexible host barrier to various pathogens. Helix-loop-helix/basic helix-loop-helix (HLH/bHLH) complexes play important roles in fine-tuning plant development. However, the function of these genes in plant immunity and how they are regulated remain obscure. Here, we identified an atypical bHLH transcription factor, Oryza sativa (Os)HLH46, that interacts with rice receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) Os BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE1-2 (OsBSK1-2), which plays a key role in rice blast resistance. OsBSK1-2 stabilized OsHLH46 both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, OsHLH46 positively regulates rice blast resistance, which depends on OsBSK1-2. OsHLH46 has no transcriptional activation activity and interacts with a typical bHLH protein, OsbHLH6, which negatively regulates rice blast resistance. OsbHLH6 binds to the promoter of OsWRKY45 and inhibits its expression, while OsHLH46 suppresses the function of OsbHLH6 by blocking its DNA binding and transcriptional inhibition of OsWRKY45. Consistent with these findings, OsWRKY45 was up-regulated in OsHLH46-overexpressing plants. In addition, the oshlh46 mutant overexpressing OsbHLH6 is more susceptible to Magnaporthe oryzae than is the wild type, suggesting that OsHLH46 suppresses OsbHLH6-mediated rice blast resistance. Our results not only demonstrated that OsBSK1-2 regulates rice blast resistance via the OsHLH46/OsbHLH6 complex, but also uncovered a new mechanism for plants to fine-tune plant immunity by regulating the HLH/bHLH complex via RLCKs.",plant need finetune defense response maintain robust flexible host barrier various pathogen helixloophelixbasic helixloophelix hlhbhlh complex play important role finetuning plant development however function gene plant immunity regulated remain obscure identified atypical bhlh transcription factor oryza sativa oshlh interacts rice receptorlike cytoplasmic kinase rlck o brassinosteroidsignaling kinase osbsk play key role rice blast resistance osbsk stabilized oshlh vivo vitro addition oshlh positively regulates rice blast resistance depends osbsk oshlh transcriptional activation activity interacts typical bhlh protein osbhlh negatively regulates rice blast resistance osbhlh bind promoter oswrky inhibits expression oshlh suppresses function osbhlh blocking dna binding transcriptional inhibition oswrky consistent finding oswrky upregulated oshlhoverexpressing plant addition oshlh mutant overexpressing osbhlh susceptible magnaporthe oryzae wild type suggesting oshlh suppresses osbhlhmediated rice blast resistance result demonstrated osbsk regulates rice blast resistance via oshlhosbhlh complex also uncovered new mechanism plant finetune plant immunity regulating hlhbhlh complex via rlcks,0,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8

27701783,Activation of ethylene signaling pathways enhances disease resistance by regulating ROS and phytoalexin production in rice.,"Ethylene plays diverse roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. However, the roles of ethylene signaling in immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae infection activated ethylene biosynthesis in rice. Resistant rice cultivars accumulated higher levels of ethylene than susceptible ones. Ethylene signaling components OsEIN2 and the downstream transcription factor OsEIL1 positively regulated disease resistance. Mutation of OsEIN2 led to enhanced disease susceptibility. Whole-genome transcription analysis revealed that responsive genes of ethylene, jasmonates (JAs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling as well as phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were remarkably induced. Transcription of OsrbohA/B, which encode NADPH oxidases, and OsOPRs, the JA biosynthesis genes, were induced by M. oryzae infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OsEIL1 binds to the promoters of OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR4 to activate their expression. These data suggest that OsEIN2-mediated OsrbohA/OsrbohB and OsOPR transcription may play essential roles in ROS generation, JA biosynthesis and the subsequent phytoalexin accumulation. Therefore, the involvement of ethylene signaling in disease resistance is probably by activation of ROS and phytoalexin production in rice during M. oryzae infection.",ethylene play diverse role plant growth development stress response however role ethylene signaling immune response remain largely unknown study showed blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae infection activated ethylene biosynthesis rice resistant rice cultivar accumulated higher level ethylene susceptible one ethylene signaling component osein downstream transcription factor oseil positively regulated disease resistance mutation osein led enhanced disease susceptibility wholegenome transcription analysis revealed responsive gene ethylene jasmonates jas reactive oxygen specie ro signaling well phytoalexin biosynthesis gene remarkably induced transcription osrbohab encode nadph oxidase osoprs ja biosynthesis gene induced oryzae infection furthermore demonstrated oseil bind promoter osrbohaosrbohb osopr activate expression data suggest oseinmediated osrbohaosrbohb osopr transcription may play essential role ro generation ja biosynthesis subsequent phytoalexin accumulation therefore involvement ethylene signaling disease resistance probably activation ro phytoalexin production rice oryzae infection,4,"{'Disease': ['blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae infection', 'positively regulated disease resistance mutation osein', 'enhanced disease susceptibility wholegenome transcription analysis', 'ethylene signaling disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
8720923,Cloning and characterization of a probenazole-inducible gene for an intracellular pathogenesis-related protein in rice.,"Probenazole (3-allyloxy-1,2-benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide) induces disease resistance in rice against rice blast fungus. To investigate the molecular mechanism of probenazole-induced resistance, we isolated and characterized a cDNA clone of a probenazole-inducible gene in rice, which encoded a protein designated PBZ1. Sequence analysis revealed that significant homology at the amino acid level exists between the predicted PBZ1 protein and intracellular pathogenesis-related (IPR) proteins. Accumulation of PBZ1 mRNA was not induced by wounding, but markedly induced by inoculation with rice blast fungus. In addition, it was induced sooner by inoculation with an incompatible race than that with a compatible race. On the other hand, when the accumulation of the PBZ1 mRNA was examined after treatment with probenazole-related compounds, it was not fully correlated with anti-rice blast activity. However, it was induced after treatment with N-cyano-methyl-2-chloro-isonicotinamide (NCI), which belongs to another group of compounds known to induce disease resistance. Thus, although the accumulation of the PBZ1 mRNA was not fully correlated with anti-rice blast activity, our findings suggest that the PBZ1 gene has an important function during the disease resistance response in rice.",probenazole allyloxybenzisothiazoledioxide induces disease resistance rice rice blast fungus investigate molecular mechanism probenazoleinduced resistance isolated characterized cdna clone probenazoleinducible gene rice encoded protein designated pbz sequence analysis revealed significant homology amino acid level exists predicted pbz protein intracellular pathogenesisrelated ipr protein accumulation pbz mrna induced wounding markedly induced inoculation rice blast fungus addition induced sooner inoculation incompatible race compatible race hand accumulation pbz mrna examined treatment probenazolerelated compound fully correlated antirice blast activity however induced treatment ncyanomethylchloroisonicotinamide nci belongs another group compound known induce disease resistance thus although accumulation pbz mrna fully correlated antirice blast activity finding suggest pbz gene important function disease resistance response rice,4,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance rice rice blast fungus', 'markedly induced inoculation rice blast fungus addition', 'known induce disease resistance', 'pbz gene important function disease resistance response rice'], 'Treatment': ['sooner inoculation incompatible race compatible race hand accumulation pbz mrna examined treatment probenazolerelated compound', 'treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",7
24841201,Palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of the rice resistance protein pit is critical for the activation of the small GTPase OsRac1.,"Nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing family proteins function as intracellular immune sensors in both plants and animals. In plants, the downstream components activated by NLR family proteins and the immune response mechanisms induced by these downstream molecules are largely unknown. We have previously found that the small GTPase OsRac1, which acts as a molecular switch in rice immunity, is activated by Pit, an NLR-type resistance (R) protein to rice blast fungus, and this activation plays critical roles in Pit-mediated immunity. However, the sites and mechanisms of activation of Pit in vivo remain unknown. To clarify the mechanisms involved in the localization of Pit, we searched for consensus sequences in Pit that specify membrane localization and found a pair of potential palmitoylation sites in the N-terminal coiled-coil region. Although wild-type Pit was localized mainly to the plasma membrane, this membrane localization was compromised in a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of Pit. The palmitoylation-deficient Pit displayed significantly lower affinity for OsRac1 on the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in failures of the Pit-mediated cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species, and disease resistance to rice blast fungus. These results indicate that palmitoylation-dependent membrane localization of Pit is required for the interaction with and the activation of OsRac1 and that OsRac1 activation by Pit is vital for Pit-mediated disease resistance to rice blast fungus.",nucleotide binding domain leucinerich repeat nlrcontaining family protein function intracellular immune sensor plant animal plant downstream component activated nlr family protein immune response mechanism induced downstream molecule largely unknown previously found small gtpase osrac act molecular switch rice immunity activated pit nlrtype resistance r protein rice blast fungus activation play critical role pitmediated immunity however site mechanism activation pit vivo remain unknown clarify mechanism involved localization pit searched consensus sequence pit specify membrane localization found pair potential palmitoylation site nterminal coiledcoil region although wildtype pit localized mainly plasma membrane membrane localization compromised palmitoylationdeficient mutant pit palmitoylationdeficient pit displayed significantly lower affinity osrac plasma membrane thereby resulting failure pitmediated cell death production reactive oxygen specie disease resistance rice blast fungus result indicate palmitoylationdependent membrane localization pit required interaction activation osrac osrac activation pit vital pitmediated disease resistance rice blast fungus,1,"{'Disease': ['cell death production reactive oxygen specie disease resistance rice blast fungus result'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
20807214,Durable panicle blast-resistance gene Pb1 encodes an atypical CC-NBS-LRR protein and was generated by acquiring a promoter through local genome duplication.,"Rice blast is one of the most widespread and destructive plant diseases worldwide. Breeders have used disease resistance (R) genes that mediate fungal race-specific 'gene-for-gene' resistance to manage rice blast, but the resistance is prone to breakdown due to high pathogenic variability of blast fungus. Panicle blast 1 (Pb1) is a blast-resistance gene derived from the indica cultivar 'Modan'. Pb1-mediated resistance, which is characterized by durability of resistance and adult/panicle blast resistance, has been introduced into elite varieties for commercial cultivation. We isolated the Pb1 gene by map-based cloning. It encoded a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding-site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein. The Pb1 protein sequence differed from previously reported R-proteins, particularly in the NBS domain, in which the P-loop was apparently absent and some other motifs were degenerated. Pb1 was located within one of tandemly repeated 60-kb units, which presumably arose through local genome duplication. Pb1 transcript levels increased during the development of Pb1+ cultivars; this expression pattern accounts for their adult/panicle resistance. Promoter:GUS analysis indicated that genome duplication played a crucial role in the generation of Pb1 by placing a promoter sequence upstream of its coding sequence, thereby conferring a Pb1-characteristic expression pattern to a transcriptionally inactive 'sleeping' resistance gene. We discuss possible determinants for the durability of Pb1-mediated blast resistance.",rice blast one widespread destructive plant disease worldwide breeder used disease resistance r gene mediate fungal racespecific geneforgene resistance manage rice blast resistance prone breakdown due high pathogenic variability blast fungus panicle blast pb blastresistance gene derived indica cultivar modan pbmediated resistance characterized durability resistance adultpanicle blast resistance introduced elite variety commercial cultivation isolated pb gene mapbased cloning encoded coiledcoilnucleotidebindingsiteleucinerich repeat ccnbslrr protein pb protein sequence differed previously reported rproteins particularly nb domain ploop apparently absent motif degenerated pb located within one tandemly repeated kb unit presumably arose local genome duplication pb transcript level increased development pb cultivar expression pattern account adultpanicle resistance promotergus analysis indicated genome duplication played crucial role generation pb placing promoter sequence upstream coding sequence thereby conferring pbcharacteristic expression pattern transcriptionally inactive sleeping resistance gene discus possible determinant durability pbmediated blast resistance,2,"{'Disease': ['one widespread destructive plant disease', 'disease resistance r gene mediate fungal racespecific geneforgene resistance', 'due high pathogenic variability blast fungus panicle blast pb blastresistance gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

To understand their roles in pathogenesis, their expressions during fungal infection were studied. An aggressive R. solani strain, RIRS-K, was first identified among six isolates, RIRS-K, RIRS-17, RIRS-S, RIRS-T, RIRS-MU and RIRS-FD, for inducing a maximum relative lesion height (RLH) of 32.7% on a ShB susceptible cultivar, Pusa Basmati-1. Hypothetical pathogenicity genes (52 nos) identified by in silico analyses of the publicly available genomic database of the pathogen strain were evaluated in Pathogen-Host Interaction (PHI) blast and RIRS-K. Though PHI blast identified 26 genes as potential ones, only 8 were constitutively expressive in RIRS-K cultured in a minimal broth. Among them, only expressions of AG1IA_06195, AG02692, AG04508, and AG05730 were induced in the rice plant inoculated with RIRS-K and, hence, were identified as the candidate ones. The candidate genes were highly expressed in the aggressive strain (RIRS-K) in comparison to the less aggressive one (RIRS-17). In further testing of their expressions in the highly aggressive fungal strain, RIRS-K infecting PB-1 pre-colonized by a potent biocontrol consortium comprising of Bacillus subtilis (S17TH), Pseudomonas putida (TEPF-Sungal-1), and Trichoderma harzianum (S17TH), the disease scoring and gene expression studies indicated that the candidate genes were downregulated.

Here, we report the isolation of a novel MAP kinase in rice that is induced during infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea or upon mechanical wounding. The gene is designated as BWMK1 for blast- and wound-induced MAP kinase. The cDNA of BWMK1 was isolated from rice leaves challenged by the blast pathogen. Transcripts of the corresponding gene accumulated in rice leaves 4 h after blast inoculation and 30 min after mechanical wounding. This gene encodes a 506 amino acid protein that contains a new dual-phosphorylation activation motif TDY and about 150 unique amino acids on its C terminus. In-gel kinase activity and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that BWMK1 is a functional MAP kinase.

20435900,Translocation of Magnaporthe oryzae effectors into rice cells and their subsequent cell-to-cell movement.,"Knowledge remains limited about how fungal pathogens that colonize living plant cells translocate effector proteins inside host cells to regulate cellular processes and neutralize defense responses. To cause the globally important rice blast disease, specialized invasive hyphae (IH) invade successive living rice (Oryza sativa) cells while enclosed in host-derived extrainvasive hyphal membrane. Using live-cell imaging, we identified a highly localized structure, the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), which accumulates fluorescently labeled effectors secreted by IH. In each newly entered rice cell, effectors were first secreted into BICs at the tips of the initially filamentous hyphae in the cell. These tip BICs were left behind beside the first-differentiated bulbous IH cells as the fungus continued to colonize the host cell. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments showed that the effector protein PWL2 (for prevents pathogenicity toward weeping lovegrass [Eragrostis curvula]) continued to accumulate in BICs after IH were growing elsewhere. PWL2 and BAS1 (for biotrophy-associated secreted protein 1), BIC-localized secreted proteins, were translocated into the rice cytoplasm. By contrast, BAS4, which uniformly outlines the IH, was not translocated into the host cytoplasm. Fluorescent PWL2 and BAS1 proteins that reached the rice cytoplasm moved into uninvaded neighbors, presumably preparing host cells before invasion. We report robust assays for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underpin effector secretion into BICs, translocation to the rice cytoplasm, and cell-to-cell movement in rice.",knowledge remains limited fungal pathogen colonize living plant cell translocate effector protein inside host cell regulate cellular process neutralize defense response cause globally important rice blast disease specialized invasive hypha ih invade successive living rice oryza sativa cell enclosed hostderived extrainvasive hyphal membrane using livecell imaging identified highly localized structure biotrophic interfacial complex bic accumulates fluorescently labeled effector secreted ih newly entered rice cell effector first secreted bics tip initially filamentous hypha cell tip bics left behind beside firstdifferentiated bulbous ih cell fungus continued colonize host cell fluorescence recovery photobleaching experiment showed effector protein pwl prevents pathogenicity toward weeping lovegrass eragrostis curvula continued accumulate bics ih growing elsewhere pwl ba biotrophyassociated secreted protein biclocalized secreted protein translocated rice cytoplasm contrast ba uniformly outline ih translocated host cytoplasm fluorescent pwl ba protein reached rice cytoplasm moved uninvaded neighbor presumably preparing host cell invasion report robust assay elucidating molecular mechanism underpin effector secretion bics translocation rice cytoplasm celltocell movement rice,3,"{'Disease': ['globally important rice blast disease', 'firstdifferentiated bulbous ih cell fungus continued colonize host cell fluorescence recovery photobleaching experiment'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['limited fungal pathogen colonize living plant cell translocate effector protein', 'fluorescently labeled effector', 'newly entered rice cell effector', 'effector protein pwl', 'effector secretion bics translocation rice cytoplasm celltocell movement rice']}",7

This Alu-Inter SSR technique revealed high polymorphism among the Korean blast fungal isolates. Then, fragments from the Alu-Inter SSR analysis were isolated to be used as probes in Southern hybridization, which also revealed high polymorphism between isolates to distinguish individuals. The sequences of the isolated fragments contained TC/AG tandem repeats interspersed with a 30 bp direct repeat. In gel blot analysis, the isolated TC/AG repeat microsatellite sequences were proved to be useful for characterizing the isolates in blast fungi in addition to the conventional MGR (Magnaporthe grisea repeat) probes.

Cti6 is a nuclear protein containing a plant homeodomain (PHD) that is involved in transcriptional regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biological function of its homologous protein in M. oryzae has been elusive. Here, we report Clp1 with a PHD domain in M. oryzae, a homologous protein of the yeast Cti6. Clp1 was mainly located in the nucleus and partly in the vesicles. Clp1 colocalized and interacted with the autophagy-related proteins Atg5, Atg7, Atg16, Atg24, and Atg28 at preautophagosomal structures (PAS) and autophagosomes, and the loss of Clp1 increased the fungal background autophagy level.

38462083,Carbon nanosol promotes plant growth and broad-spectrum resistance.,"Carbon nanosol (CNS) is a carbon-based nanomaterial capable of promoting plant growth while the underlying mechanism involved in this process remains unknown. This study demonstrates that CNS promotes rice seedling growth under restricted concentrations. Macroelement transporter mutants were investigated to further investigate the CNS-mediated promotion of rice seedling growth. The genetic and physiological findings revealed that nitrate transporter 1.1B (NRT1.1B) and ammonium transporter 1 (AMT1) mutants inhibited the CNS-induced growth development of rice seedlings, whereas potassium transporter (AKT1) and phosphate transporter 8 (PT8) did not exhibit any inhibitory effects. Further investigations demonstrated the inhibition of CNS-mediated growth promotion via glutamine synthetase 1;1 (gs1;1) mutants. Additionally, the administration of CNS resulted in enhanced accumulation of chlorophyll in plants, and the promotion of CNS-induced growth was inhibited by yellow-green leaf 8 (YGL8) mutants and the chlorophyll biosynthetic gene divinyl reductase (DVR) mutants. According to these findings, the CNS promotes plant growth by stimulating chlorophyll biosynthesis. Furthermore, the presence of CNS enhanced the ability of rice to withstand blast, sheath blight (ShB), and bacterial blight. The nrt1.1b, amt1, dvr, and ygl8 mutants did not exhibit a broad spectrum effect. The positive regulation of broad-spectrum resistance in rice by GS1;1 suggests the requirement of N assimilation for CNS-mediated broad-spectrum resistance. In addition, an in vitro assay demonstrated that CNS inhibits the growth of pathogens responsible for blast, ShB, and bacterial blight, namely Magnaporthe oryzae, Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv.

However, the molecular functions of such exocytotic molecules in rice are poorly understood. Here, we examined the molecular function of OsSEC3A, an important subunit of the exocyst complex in rice. The OsSEC3A gene is expressed in various organs, and OsSEC3A has the potential ability to participate in the exocyst complex by interacting with several other exocyst subunits. Disruption of OsSEC3A by CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) caused dwarf stature and a lesion-mimic phenotype. The Ossec3a mutant exhibited enhanced defense responses, as shown by up-regulated transcript levels of pathogenesis- and salicylic acid synthesis-related genes, increased levels of salicylic acid, and enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that OsSEC3A has a punctate distribution with the plasma membrane. In addition, OsSEC3A interacted with rice SNAP25-type t-SNARE protein OsSNAP32, which is involved in rice blast resistance, via the C-terminus and bound to phosphatidylinositol lipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, through its N-terminus.

Inoculation of the RILs and an F(2) population from a cross between the two cultivars with the avirulent isolate 193-1-1 in the growth chamber indicated the presence of two dominant R genes in XZ3150.

Functional analysis has revealed a detailed molecular mechanism involving PUB proteins in relation to abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, characteristics of 77 <i>OsPUB</i> genes in rice were identified. Systematic and comprehensive analyses of the <i>OsPUB</i> gene family were then performed, including analysis of conserved domains, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure, chromosome location, cis-acting elements, and expression patterns. Through transcriptome analysis, we confirmed that 16 <i>OsPUB</i> genes show similar expression patterns in drought stress and blast infection response pathways. Numerous cis-acting elements were found in promoter sequences of 16 <i>OsPUB</i> genes, indicating that the <i>OsPUB</i> genes might be involved in complex regulatory networks to control hormones, stress responses, and cellular development. We performed qRT-PCR on 16 <i>OsPUB</i> genes under drought stress and blast infection to further identify the reliability of transcriptome and cis-element analysis data. It was confirmed that the expression pattern was similar to RNA-sequencing analysis results. The transcription of <i>OsPUB</i> under various stress conditions indicates that the PUB gene might have various functions in the responses of rice to abiotic and biotic stresses. Taken together, these results indicate that the genome-wide analysis of <i>OsPUB</i> genes can provide a solid basis for the functional analysis of U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase genes.

26506081,"Diterpenoid phytoalexin factor, a bHLH transcription factor, plays a central role in the biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice.","Rice (Oryza sativa) produces diterpenoid phytoalexins (DPs), momilactones and phytocassanes as major phytoalexins. Accumulation of DPs is induced in rice by blast fungus infection, copper chloride or UV light. Here, we describe a rice transcription factor named diterpenoid phytoalexin factor (DPF), which is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. The gene encoding DPF is expressed mainly in roots and panicles, and is inducible in leaves by blast infection, copper chloride or UV. Expression of all DP biosynthetic genes and accumulation of momilactones and phytocassanes were remarkably increased and decreased in DPF over-expressing and DPF knockdown rice, respectively. These results clearly demonstrated that DPF positively regulates DP accumulation via transcriptional regulation of DP biosynthetic genes, and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of DPs in rice. Furthermore, DPF activated the promoters of COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE2 (CPS2) and CYTOCHROME P450 MONOOXYGENASE 99A2 (CYP99A2), whose products are implicated in the biosynthesis of phytocassanes and momilactones, respectively. Mutations in the N-boxes in the CPS2 upstream region, to which several animal bHLH transcription factors bind, decreased CPS2 transcription, indicating that DPF positively regulates CPS2 transcription through the N-boxes.

31376807,Genome-wide alternative polyadenylation dynamics in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice.,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important way to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, and is extensively involved in plant stress responses. However, the systematic roles of APA regulation in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in rice at the genome scale remain unknown. To take advantage of available RNA-seq datasets, using a novel tool APAtrap, we identified thousands of genes with significantly differential usage of polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites in response to the abiotic stress (drought, heat shock, and cadmium) and biotic stress [bacterial blight (BB), rice blast, and rice stripe virus (RSV)]. Genes with stress-responsive APA dynamics commonly exhibited higher expression levels when their isoforms with short 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) were more abundant. The stress-responsive APA events were widely involved in crucial stress-responsive genes and pathways: e.g. APA acted as a negative regulator in heat stress tolerance; APA events were involved in DNA repair and cell wall formation under Cd stress; APA regulated chlorophyll metabolism, being associated with the pathogenesis of leaf diseases under RSV and BB challenges. Furthermore, APA events were found to be involved in glutathione metabolism and MAPK signaling pathways, mediating a crosstalk among the abiotic and biotic stress-responsive regulatory networks in rice. Analysis of large-scale datasets revealed that APA may regulate abiotic and biotic stress-responsive processes in rice. Such post-transcriptome diversities contribute to rice adaption to various environmental challenges.

26218097,One of Three Pex11 Family Members Is Required for Peroxisomal Proliferation and Full Virulence of the Rice Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Peroxisomes play important roles in metabolisms of eukaryotes and infection of plant fungal pathogens. These organelles proliferate by de novo formation or division in response to environmental stimulation. Although the assembly of peroxisomes was documented in fungal pathogens, their division and its relationship to pathogenicity remain obscure. In present work, we analyzed the roles of three Pex11 family members in peroxisomal division and pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Deletion of MoPEX11A led to fewer but enlarged peroxisomes, and impaired the separation of Woronin bodies from peroxisomes, while deletion of MoPEX11B or MoPEX11C put no evident impacts to peroxisomal profiles. MoPEX11A mutant exhibited typical peroxisome related defects, delayed conidial germination and appressoria formation, and decreased appressorial turgor and host penetration. As a result, the virulence of MoPEX11A mutant was greatly reduced. Deletion of MoPEX11B and MoPEX11C did not alter the virulence of the fungus. Further, double or triple deletions of the three genes were unable to enhance the virulence decrease in MoPEX11A mutant.

30222251,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BSR1, plays a crucial role in resistance to multiple pathogens in rice.","Plants have evolved many receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) to modulate their growth, development, and innate immunity. Broad-Spectrum Resistance 1 (BSR1) encodes a rice RLCK, whose overexpression confers resistance to multiple diseases, including fungal rice blast and bacterial leaf blight. However, the mechanisms underlying resistance remain largely unknown. In the present study, we report that BSR1 is a functional protein kinase that autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates an artificial substrate in vitro. Although BSR1 is classified as a serine/threonine kinase, it was shown to autophosphorylate on tyrosine as well as on serine/threonine residues when expressed in bacteria, demonstrating that it is a dual-specificity kinase. Protein kinase activity was found to be indispensable for resistance to rice blast and leaf blight in BSR1-overexpressing plants. Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of BSR1 was critical for proper localization of BSR1 in rice cells and played a crucial role in BSR1-mediated resistance to multiple diseases, as evidenced by compromised disease resistance in transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant BSR1 in which Tyr-63 was substituted with Ala. Overall, our data indicate that BSR1 is a non-receptor dual-specificity kinase and that both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activities are critical for the normal functioning of BSR1 in the resistance to multiple pathogens.

11310740,A novel jasmonic acid-inducible rice myb gene associates with fungal infection and host cell death.,"Endogenous signal molecules such as jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) play an important role in induced resistance against pathogen infection and insect herbivory. In rice seedlings, JA is an effective inducer of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against infection of blast fungus (Pyricularia grisea). To gain further insights into JA-mediated defense signaling pathways, we isolated and characterized a pathogen- and JA-induced rice gene (JAmyb) that encodes a Myb transcription factor. The JAmyb gene was induced within 1 day after fungal infection in resistant and susceptible interactions prior to lesion formation. Unlike most defense-related genes that are activated faster and stronger in resistant interactions, JAmyb induction by blast fungus is much higher in susceptible interactions, accompanied by large lesions and extensive tissue damage. Significant induction of JAmyb also was observed during cell death and lesion formation in certain lesion mimic mutants. Interestingly, JAmyb was activated rapidly by JA or wounding, independent of de novo protein synthesis, but not by other endogenous signal molecules such as SA and abscisic acid or SAR inducers such as benzothiadiazole and probenazole. We used SA-deficient transgenic plants to further demonstrate that depletion of SA in rice did not abolish but rather enhanced blast-induced JAmyb expression.

In contrast, both old and new leaves of the rice phytochrome triple mutant (phyAphyBphyC) are susceptible to blast fungus. We demonstrate that pathogenesis-related class 1 (PR1) proteins are rapidly and strongly induced during M. grisea infection and following exogenous jasmonate (JA) or salicylic acid (SA) exposure in the old leaves, but not in the new leaves of the wild-type. In contrast, the accumulation of PR1 proteins was significantly attenuated in old and new leaves of the phyAphyBphyC mutant. These results suggest that phytochromes are required for the induction of PR1 proteins in rice. Basal transcription levels of PR1a and PR1b were substantially higher in the wild-type as compared to the phyAphyBphyC mutant, suggesting that phytochromes also are required for basal expression of PR1 genes. Moreover, the transcript levels of genes known to function in SA- or JA-dependent defense pathways were regulated by leaf age and functional phytochromes.

22212404,The arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis promotes the systemic induction of regulatory defence-related genes in rice leaves and confers resistance to pathogen infection.,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses are mutualistic associations between soil fungi and most vascular plants. Their association benefits the host plant by improving nutrition, mainly phosphorus nutrition, and by providing increased capability to cope with adverse conditions. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional changes triggered in rice leaves as a result of AM symbiosis, focusing on the relevance of the plant defence response. We showed that root colonization by the AM fungus Glomus intraradices is accompanied by the systemic induction of genes that play a regulatory role in the host defence response, such as OsNPR1, OsAP2, OsEREBP and OsJAmyb. Genes involved in signal transduction processes (OsDUF26 and OsMPK6) and genes that function in calcium-mediated signalling processes (OsCBP, OsCaM and OsCML4) are also up-regulated in leaves of mycorrhizal rice plants in the absence of pathogen infection. In addition, the mycorrhizal rice plants exhibit a stronger induction of defence marker genes [i.e. pathogenesis-related (PR) genes] in their leaves in response to infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Evidence indicates that mycorrhizal rice plants show enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus. Overall, these results suggest that the protective effect of the AM symbiosis in rice plants relies on both the systemic activation of defence regulatory genes in the absence of pathogen challenge and the priming for stronger expression of defence effector genes during pathogen infection. The possible mechanisms involved in the mycorrhiza-induced resistance to M. oryzae infection are discussed.",arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses mutualistic association soil fungi vascular plant association benefit host plant improving nutrition mainly phosphorus nutrition providing increased capability cope adverse condition study investigated transcriptional change triggered rice leaf result symbiosis focusing relevance plant defence response showed root colonization fungus glomus intraradices accompanied systemic induction gene play regulatory role host defence response osnpr osap oserebp osjamyb gene involved signal transduction process osduf osmpk gene function calciummediated signalling process oscbp oscam oscml also upregulated leaf mycorrhizal rice plant absence pathogen infection addition mycorrhizal rice plant exhibit stronger induction defence marker gene ie pathogenesisrelated pr gene leaf response infection blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae evidence indicates mycorrhizal rice plant show enhanced resistance rice blast fungus overall result suggest protective effect symbiosis rice plant relies systemic activation defence regulatory gene absence pathogen challenge priming stronger expression defence effector gene pathogen infection possible mechanism involved mycorrhizainduced resistance oryzae infection discussed,4,"{'Disease': ['root colonization fungus glomus intraradices', 'pr gene leaf response infection blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae evidence'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['protective effect symbiosis rice plant', 'systemic activation defence regulatory gene absence pathogen challenge priming stronger expression defence effector gene pathogen infection possible mechanism']}",8
16436304,Molecular characterization of four rice genes encoding ethylene-responsive transcriptional factors and their expressions in response to biotic and abiotic stress.,"We isolated and identified four rice genes, OsBIERF1 to OsBIERF4 (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions. The OsBIERF1-4 proteins contain conserved ERF domains, but are categorized into different classes of the previously characterized ERF proteins based on their structural organizations. OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF2 belong to Classes I and II, respectively; while OsBIRERF1 and OsBIERF4 are members of Class IV. OsBIERF3 could bind specifically to the GCC box sequence and was targeted to nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermis cells. Expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice. In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings. OsBIERF1 and OsBIERF3 were activated in an incompatible interaction but not in compatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Moreover, OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding.

24521476,A systems-wide comparison of red rice (Oryza longistaminata) tissues identifies rhizome specific genes and proteins that are targets for cultivated rice improvement.,"The rhizome, the original stem of land plants, enables species to invade new territory and is a critical component of perenniality, especially in grasses. Red rice (Oryza longistaminata) is a perennial wild rice species with many valuable traits that could be used to improve cultivated rice cultivars, including rhizomatousness, disease resistance and drought tolerance. Despite these features, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that contribute to rhizome growth, development and function in this plant. We used an integrated approach to compare the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of the rhizome to other tissues of red rice. 116 Gb of transcriptome sequence was obtained from various tissues and used to identify rhizome-specific and preferentially expressed genes, including transcription factors and hormone metabolism and stress response-related genes. Proteomics and metabolomics approaches identified 41 proteins and more than 100 primary metabolites and plant hormones with rhizome preferential accumulation. Of particular interest was the identification of a large number of gene transcripts from Magnaportha oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast disease in cultivated rice, even though the red rice plants showed no sign of disease. A significant set of genes, proteins and metabolites appear to be specifically or preferentially expressed in the rhizome of O. longistaminata. The presence of M. oryzae gene transcripts at a high level in apparently healthy plants suggests that red rice is resistant to this pathogen, and may be able to provide genes to cultivated rice that will enable resistance to rice blast disease.",rhizome original stem land plant enables specie invade new territory critical component perenniality especially grass red rice oryza longistaminata perennial wild rice specie many valuable trait could used improve cultivated rice cultivar including rhizomatousness disease resistance drought tolerance despite feature little known molecular mechanism contribute rhizome growth development function plant used integrated approach compare transcriptome proteome metabolome rhizome tissue red rice gb transcriptome sequence obtained various tissue used identify rhizomespecific preferentially expressed gene including transcription factor hormone metabolism stress responserelated gene proteomics metabolomics approach identified protein primary metabolite plant hormone rhizome preferential accumulation particular interest identification large number gene transcript magnaportha oryzae fungus cause rice blast disease cultivated rice even though red rice plant showed sign disease significant set gene protein metabolite appear specifically preferentially expressed rhizome longistaminata presence oryzae gene transcript high level apparently healthy plant suggests red rice resistant pathogen may able provide gene cultivated rice enable resistance rice blast disease,8,"{'Disease': ['rhizomatousness disease resistance drought tolerance', 'magnaportha oryzae fungus cause rice blast disease', 'sign disease significant set gene protein metabolite', 'resistance rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13

In our current study, we characterized the response of a rice osrar1 T-DNA insertion mutant to infection by Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. osrar1 mutants displayed reduced resistance compared with wild type rice when inoculated with the normally virulent M. oryzae isolate PO6-6, indicating that OsRAR1 is required for an immune response to this pathogen. We also investigated the function of OsRAR1 in the resistance mechanism mediated by the immune receptor genes Pib and Pi5 that encode nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. We inoculated progeny from Pib/osrar1 and Pi5/osrar1 heterozygous plants with the avirulent M. oryzae isolates, race 007 and PO6-6, respectively.

33782910,Efficacy of bioinoculants to control of bacterial and fungal diseases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in northwestern Himalaya.,"Biological control holds great promise for environmentally friendly and sustainable management of the phytopathogens. The multi-function features of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) enable to protect the plants from disease infections by replacing the chemical inputs. The interaction between the plant root exudates and the microbes stimulates the production of secondary metabolism and enzymes and induces systemic resistance in the plants. The aim was to identify the potential PGPR which would show an antagonistic effect against basmati rice fungal and bacterial diseases. In the study, native originating microbes have been isolated, characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing, and used as potential antagonistic microbial isolates against diseases of rice plants. Rhizobacteria isolated from rhizosphere, endo-rhizosphere, and bulk soil samples of Basmati 370 exhibited promising inhibitory activity against rice pathogens. Molecular characterization of bacterial isolates based on 16S rRNA sequencing classified the bacterial isolates into different genera such as Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Exiguobacterium, Aeromonas, Chryseobacterium, Enterobacter, and Stenotrophomonas. PGPRs exhibited biocontrol activities against various rice diseases like bacterial leaf blight, leaf blast, brown spot, and sheath blight and boost the plant growth traits.

The effects of enhanced UV-B radiation (0 kJ m<sup>-2</sup>, 2.5 kJ m<sup>-2</sup>, 5.0 kJ m<sup>-2</sup> and 7.5 kJ m<sup>-2</sup>) on the rice-Magnaporthe oryzae system were studied with respect to the Magnaporthe oryzae infection, the disease-resistance physiology of the rice and the rice blast disease condition.

The activities of rice leaf disease-resistance-related enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, lipoxygenase, chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase) were significantly increased under enhanced UV-B radiation. Following inoculation with Magnaporthe oryzae, levels of disease-resistance-related substances in the rice leaves were significantly increased.

23832371,OsJAR1 contributes mainly to biosynthesis of the stress-induced jasmonoyl-isoleucine involved in defense responses in rice.,"Jasmonate plays key roles in plant growth and stress responses, as in defense against pathogen attack. Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), a major active form of jasmonates, is thought to play a pivotal role in plant defense responses, but the involvement of JA-Ile in rice defense responses, including phytoalexin production, remains largely unknown. Here we found that OsJAR1 contributes mainly to stress-induced JA-Ile production by the use of an osjar1 Tos17 mutant. The osjar1 mutant was impaired in JA-induced expression of JA-responsive genes and phytoalexin production, and these defects were restored genetically. Endogenous JA-Ile was indispensable to the production of a flavonoid phytoalexin, sakuranetin, but not to that of diterpenoid phytoalexins in response to heavy metal stress and the rice blast fungus.

The composition and dynamics of main pest species were analyzed, and the trend of rice pest succession in Yunnan was discussed based upon landmark publications. The results showed that the three rice cropping zones had different pest characteristics as regard to main species, dynamics and combined injuries. Sheath rot, bacterial leaf blight, rice stripe, leaf hoppers, armyworms and stem borers were serious in the japonica rice zone. Sheath blight and rice stripe were serious in the japonica-indica interlacing zone. Leaf blast, sheath blight, leaf folders and weeds above rice crop canopy were serious in the indica rice zone. False smut, plant hoppers and weeds below rice crop canopy were ubiquitous and serious in the three kinds of rice cropping zones. Many kinds of weed infestation emerged in the whole rice cropping seasons. Echinochloa crusgalli, Sagittaria pygmaea, Potamogeton distinctus and Spirodela polyrhiza were the main species of weeds in the rice cropping zones of Yunnan. Overall, levels of combined injuries due to pests in the japonica rice zone and the indica rice zone were higher than that in the japonica-indica interlacing zone. In terms of the trend of rice pest succession in Yunnan, injuries due to false smut, sheath blight and plant hoppers seemed to be in a worse tendency in all rice cropping zones of Yunnan, while dominants species of weeds in the paddy fields are shifting from the annual weeds to the perennial malignant weeds.",series rice pest injury due pathogen insect weed surveyed farmer field major rice variety three rice cropping zone yunnan province southwest china composition dynamic main pest specie analyzed trend rice pest succession yunnan discussed based upon landmark publication result showed three rice cropping zone different pest characteristic regard main specie dynamic combined injury sheath rot bacterial leaf blight rice stripe leaf hopper armyworm stem borer serious japonica rice zone sheath blight rice stripe serious japonicaindica interlacing zone leaf blast sheath blight leaf folder weed rice crop canopy serious indica rice zone false smut plant hopper weed rice crop canopy ubiquitous serious three kind rice cropping zone many kind weed infestation emerged whole rice cropping season echinochloa crusgalli sagittaria pygmaea potamogeton distinctus spirodela polyrhiza main specie weed rice cropping zone yunnan overall level combined injury due pest japonica rice zone indica rice zone higher japonicaindica interlacing zone term trend rice pest succession yunnan injury due false smut sheath blight plant hopper seemed worse tendency rice cropping zone yunnan dominant specie weed paddy field shifting annual weed perennial malignant weed,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
23242918,Expression of the chimeric receptor between the chitin elicitor receptor CEBiP and the receptor-like protein kinase Pi-d2 leads to enhanced responses to the chitin elicitor and disease resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.,"We previously reported that rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor consisting of rice chitin oligosaccharides binding protein (CEBiP) and the intracellular protein kinase region of Xa21, which confers resistance to rice bacterial blight, showed enhanced cellular responses to a chitin elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose and increased resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we investigated whether CEBiP fused with another type of receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) also functions as a chimeric receptor. Fusion proteins CRPis consist of CEBiP and the intracellular protein kinase region of a true resistance gene Pi-d2. Transgenic rice expressing a CRPi showed enhanced cellular responses specifically to N-acetylchitoheptaose in cultured cells and increased levels of disease resistance against M. oryzae in plants. These responses depended on the amino acid sequences predicted to be essential for the protein kinase activity of CRPi. The structure of the transmembrane domain in CRPi affected the protein accumulation, cellular responses, and disease resistance in transgenic rice. These results suggest that the chimeric receptor consisting of CEBiP and Pi-d2 functions as a receptor for chitin oligosaccharides and CEBiP-based chimeric receptors fused with other RLKs may also act as functional receptors.",previously reported rice plant expressing chimeric receptor consisting rice chitin oligosaccharide binding protein cebip intracellular protein kinase region xa confers resistance rice bacterial blight showed enhanced cellular response chitin elicitor nacetylchitoheptaose increased resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae investigated whether cebip fused another type receptorlike protein kinase rlk also function chimeric receptor fusion protein crpis consist cebip intracellular protein kinase region true resistance gene pid transgenic rice expressing crpi showed enhanced cellular response specifically nacetylchitoheptaose cultured cell increased level disease resistance oryzae plant response depended amino acid sequence predicted essential protein kinase activity crpi structure transmembrane domain crpi affected protein accumulation cellular response disease resistance transgenic rice result suggest chimeric receptor consisting cebip pid function receptor chitin oligosaccharide cebipbased chimeric receptor fused rlks may also act functional receptor,1,"{'Disease': ['resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'specifically nacetylchitoheptaose cultured cell increased level disease resistance oryzae plant response', 'essential protein kinase activity crpi structure transmembrane domain crpi affected protein accumulation cellular response disease resistance transgenic rice result'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

34473798,Marker-assisted forward and backcross breeding for improvement of elite Indian rice variety Naveen for multiple biotic and abiotic stress tolerance.,"The elite Indian rice variety, Naveen is highly susceptible to major biotic and abiotic stresses such as blast, bacterial blight (BB), gall midge (GM) and drought which limit its productivity in rainfed areas. In the present study, a combined approach of marker-assisted forward (MAFB) and back cross (MABC) breeding was followed to introgress three major genes, viz., Pi9 for blast, Xa21 for bacterial blight (BB), and Gm8 for gall midge (GM) and three major QTLs, viz., qDTY1.1, qDTY2.2 and qDTY4.1 conferring increased yield under drought in the background of Naveen. At each stage of advancement, gene-based/linked markers were used for the foreground selection of biotic and abiotic stress tolerant genes/QTLs. Intensive phenotype-based selections were performed in the field for identification of lines with high level of resistance against blast, BB, GM and drought tolerance without yield penalty under non-stress situation. A set of 8 MAFB lines and 12 MABC lines with 3 to 6 genes/QTLs and possessing resistance/tolerance against biotic stresses and reproductive stage drought stress with better yield performance compared to Naveen were developed.

18945932,Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374r-induced systemic resistance in rice against Magnaporthe oryzae is based on pseudobactin-mediated priming for a salicylic acid-repressible multifaceted defense response.,"Selected strains of nonpathogenic rhizobacteria can reduce disease in foliar tissues through the induction of a defense state known as induced systemic resistance (ISR). Compared with the large body of information on ISR in dicotyledonous plants, little is known about the mechanisms underlying rhizobacteria-induced resistance in cereal crops. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374r to trigger ISR in rice (Oryza sativa) against the leaf blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Using salicylic acid (SA)-nonaccumulating NahG rice, an ethylene-insensitive OsEIN2 antisense line, and the jasmonate-deficient mutant hebiba, we show that this WCS374r-induced resistance is regulated by an SA-independent but jasmonic acid/ethylene-modulated signal transduction pathway. Bacterial mutant analysis uncovered a pseudobactin-type siderophore as the crucial determinant responsible for ISR elicitation. Root application of WCS374r-derived pseudobactin (Psb374) primed naive leaves for accelerated expression of a pronounced multifaceted defense response, consisting of rapid recruitment of phenolic compounds at sites of pathogen entry, concerted expression of a diverse set of structural defenses, and a timely hyperinduction of hydrogen peroxide formation putatively driving cell wall fortification. Exogenous SA application alleviated this Psb374-modulated defense priming, while Psb374 pretreatment antagonized infection-induced transcription of SA-responsive PR genes, suggesting that the Psb374- and SA-modulated signaling pathways are mutually antagonistic. Interestingly, in sharp contrast to WCS374r-mediated ISR, chemical induction of blast resistance by the SA analog benzothiadiazole was independent of jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling and involved the potentiation of SA-responsive gene expression. Together, these results offer novel insights into the signaling circuitry governing induced resistance against M. oryzae and suggest that rice is endowed with multiple blast-effective resistance pathways.",selected strain nonpathogenic rhizobacteria reduce disease foliar tissue induction defense state known induced systemic resistance isr compared large body information isr dicotyledonous plant little known mechanism underlying rhizobacteriainduced resistance cereal crop demonstrate ability pseudomonas fluorescens wcsr trigger isr rice oryza sativa leaf blast pathogen magnaporthe oryzae using salicylic acid sanonaccumulating nahg rice ethyleneinsensitive osein antisense line jasmonatedeficient mutant hebiba show wcsrinduced resistance regulated saindependent jasmonic acidethylenemodulated signal transduction pathway bacterial mutant analysis uncovered pseudobactintype siderophore crucial determinant responsible isr elicitation root application wcsrderived pseudobactin psb primed naive leaf accelerated expression pronounced multifaceted defense response consisting rapid recruitment phenolic compound site pathogen entry concerted expression diverse set structural defense timely hyperinduction hydrogen peroxide formation putatively driving cell wall fortification exogenous sa application alleviated psbmodulated defense priming psb pretreatment antagonized infectioninduced transcription saresponsive pr gene suggesting psb samodulated signaling pathway mutually antagonistic interestingly sharp contrast wcsrmediated isr chemical induction blast resistance sa analog benzothiadiazole independent jasmonic acidethylene signaling involved potentiation saresponsive gene expression together result offer novel insight signaling circuitry governing induced resistance oryzae suggest rice endowed multiple blasteffective resistance pathway,4,"{'Disease': ['disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['rice endowed multiple blasteffective resistance pathway']}",8
21043575,The role of catalase-peroxidase secreted by Magnaporthe oryzae during early infection of rice cells.,"The biological role of a secretory catalase of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae was studied. The internal amino acid sequences of the partially purified catalase in the culture filtrate enabled us to identify its encoding gene as a catalase-peroxidase gene, CPXB, among four putative genes for catalase or catalase-peroxidase in M. oryzae. Knockout of the gene drastically reduced the level of catalase activity in the culture filtrate and supernatant of conidial suspension (SCS), and increased the sensitivity to exogenously added H₂O₂ compared with control strains, suggesting that CPXB is the major gene encoding the secretory catalase and confers resistance to H₂O₂ in hyphae. In the mutant, the rate of appressoria that induced accumulation of H₂O₂ in epidermal cells of the leaf sheath increased and infection at early stages was delayed; however, the formation of lesions in the leaf blade was not affected compared with the control strain. These phenotypes were complimented by reintroducing the putative coding regions of CPXB driven by a constitutive promoter. These results suggest that CPXB plays a role in fungal defense against H₂O₂ accumulated in epidermal cells of rice at the early stage of infection but not in pathogenicity of M. oryzae.",biological role secretory catalase rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae studied internal amino acid sequence partially purified catalase culture filtrate enabled u identify encoding gene catalaseperoxidase gene cpxb among four putative gene catalase catalaseperoxidase oryzae knockout gene drastically reduced level catalase activity culture filtrate supernatant conidial suspension sc increased sensitivity exogenously added h₂o₂ compared control strain suggesting cpxb major gene encoding secretory catalase confers resistance h₂o₂ hypha mutant rate appressoria induced accumulation h₂o₂ epidermal cell leaf sheath increased infection early stage delayed however formation lesion leaf blade affected compared control strain phenotype complimented reintroducing putative coding region cpxb driven constitutive promoter result suggest cpxb play role fungal defense h₂o₂ accumulated epidermal cell rice early stage infection pathogenicity oryzae,4,"{'Disease': ['biological role secretory catalase rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4
29385213,The fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae suppresses innate immunity by modulating a host potassium channel.,"Potassium (K+) is required by plants for growth and development, and also contributes to immunity against pathogens. However, it has not been established whether pathogens modulate host K+ signaling pathways to enhance virulence and subvert host immunity. Here, we show that the effector protein AvrPiz-t from the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae targets a K+ channel to subvert plant immunity. AvrPiz-t interacts with the rice plasma-membrane-localized K+ channel protein OsAKT1 and specifically suppresses the OsAKT1-mediated K+ currents. Genetic and phenotypic analyses show that loss of OsAKT1 leads to decreased K+ content and reduced resistance against M. oryzae. Strikingly, AvrPiz-t interferes with the association of OsAKT1 with its upstream regulator, the cytoplasmic kinase OsCIPK23, which also plays a positive role in K+ absorption and resistance to M. oryzae. Furthermore, we show a direct correlation between blast disease resistance and external K+ status in rice plants. Together, our data present a novel mechanism by which a pathogen suppresses plant host immunity by modulating a host K+ channel.",potassium k required plant growth development also contributes immunity pathogen however established whether pathogen modulate host k signaling pathway enhance virulence subvert host immunity show effector protein avrpizt rice blast pathogen magnaporthe oryzae target k channel subvert plant immunity avrpizt interacts rice plasmamembranelocalized k channel protein osakt specifically suppresses osaktmediated k current genetic phenotypic analysis show loss osakt lead decreased k content reduced resistance oryzae strikingly avrpizt interferes association osakt upstream regulator cytoplasmic kinase oscipk also play positive role k absorption resistance oryzae furthermore show direct correlation blast disease resistance external k status rice plant together data present novel mechanism pathogen suppresses plant host immunity modulating host k channel,9,"{'Disease': ['direct correlation blast disease resistance external k status rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['virulence subvert host immunity show effector protein avrpizt rice blast pathogen']}",9

39244093,"Synergy between virus and three kingdom pathogens, fungus, bacterium and virus is lost in rice mutant lines of OsRDR1/6.","Co-infection, caused by multiple pathogen attacks on an organism, can lead to disease development or immunity. This complex interaction can be synergetic, co-existing, or antagonistic, ultimately influencing disease severity. The interaction between fungus, bacterium, and virus (three kingdom pathogens) is most prevalent. However, the underlying mechanisms of co-infection need to be explored further. In this study, we investigated the co-infection phenomenon in rice plants exposed to multiple pathogen species, specifically Rice necrosis mosaic virus (RNMV) and rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae, MO), bacterial leaf blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, XO) or Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Our research showed that RNMV interacts synergistically with MO, XO, or CMV, increasing pathogen growth and lesion size. These findings suggest positive synergy in RNMV co-infections with three kingdom pathogens, increasing accumulation and symptoms. Additionally, to investigate the role of RNAi in pathogen synergism, we analyzed rice mutant lines deficient in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 (OsRDR1) or 6 (OsRDR6).

22437844,The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity.,"The Rac/Rop GTPase OsRac1 plays an essential role in rice immunity. However, the regulatory genes acting downstream of OsRac1 are largely unknown. We focused on the RAI1 gene, which is up-regulated in suspension cells expressing a constitutively active form of OsRac1. RAI1 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. A microarray analysis of cells transformed with an inducible RAI1 construct showed increased expression of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes after induction, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RAI1. This was confirmed using RAI1 T-DNA activation-tagged and RNA interference lines. The PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes were also up-regulated by sphingolipid and chitin elicitors, and the RAI1 activation-tagged plants had increased resistance to a rice blast fungus. These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice. RAI1 interacted with OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 proteins in vivo and in vitro. Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro. Overexpression of OsMAPK6 and/or OsMAPK3 together with OsMKK4-dd increased PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression in rice protoplasts. Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that OsMAPK3 and OsRac1 occur in the same complex as OsMAPK6. Taken together, our results indicate that RAI1 could be regulated by OsRac1 through an OsMAPK3/6 cascade. In this study, we have identified RAI1 as the first transcription factor acting downstream of OsRac1.

However, the molecular basis of lesion mimic formation remains largely unknown. Here, we first used a proteomic approach to identify differentially expressed proteins during dynamic lesion mimic formation in the rice oscul3a mutant, then electron microscope observation and physiological assays were used to analyze the mutant. The oscul3a mutant had disrupted cell metabolism balance, and the identified differentially expressed proteins were mainly located in the chloroplast and cytoplasm, which caused enhanced lipid metabolism, but suppressed carbon/nitrogen metabolism with reduced growth and grain quality. The oscul3a mutant had higher salicylic acid (SA) concentration in leaves, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was shown to accumulate late in the formation of lesions. The secondary metabolite coumarin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and had rice blast resistance activity. Moreover, the cell death initiated lesion mimic formation of oscul3a mutant was light-sensitive, which might be associated with metabolite biosynthesis and accumulation. This study sheds light on the metabolic transition associated with cell death and defense response, which is under tight regulation by OsCUL3a and metabolism-related proteins, and the newly identified chemicals in the secondary metabolic pathway can potentially be used to control disease in crop plants.",lesion mimic mutant ideal genetic material study programmed cell death defense signaling plant however molecular basis lesion mimic formation remains largely unknown first used proteomic approach identify differentially expressed protein dynamic lesion mimic formation rice oscula mutant electron microscope observation physiological assay used analyze mutant oscula mutant disrupted cell metabolism balance identified differentially expressed protein mainly located chloroplast cytoplasm caused enhanced lipid metabolism suppressed carbonnitrogen metabolism reduced growth grain quality oscula mutant higher salicylic acid sa concentration leaf hsubsubosubsub shown accumulate late formation lesion secondary metabolite coumarin induced reactive oxygen specie ro rice blast resistance activity moreover cell death initiated lesion mimic formation oscula mutant lightsensitive might associated metabolite biosynthesis accumulation study shed light metabolic transition associated cell death defense response tight regulation oscula metabolismrelated protein newly identified chemical secondary metabolic pathway potentially used control disease crop plant,4,"{'Disease': ['control disease crop plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8

The systemic defence response upon migratory nematode infection was remarkably similar to fungal rice blast infection. Almost all investigated defence-related genes were up-regulated in rice shoots 3 days after root rot nematode attack, including the phenylpropanoid pathway, ethylene pathway and PR genes, but many of which were suppressed at 7 dpi. Systemic shoot tissue of RKN-infected plants showed similar attenuation of expression of almost all studied genes already at 3 dpi, with clear attenuation of the ethylene pathway and methyl jasmonate biosynthesis.

16673940,Molecular analysis of the rice MAP kinase gene family in relation to Magnaporthe grisea infection.,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In Arabidopsis, 20 MAPKs have been identified and divided into four major groups. In rice, a monocot model and economically important cereal crop, only five MAPKs were characterized, including three related to the host defense response. In this study, we have identified 17 members of the rice MAPK gene (OsMPK) family through an in silico search of rice genome databases. Based on the phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of Arabidopsis and rice MAPKs, we propose that MAPKs can be divided into six groups. Interestingly, the rice genome contains many more MAPKs with the TDY phosphorylation site (11 members) than with the TEY motif (six members). In contrast, the Arabidopsis genome contains more MAPKs with the TEY motif (12 members) than with the TDY motif (eight members). Upon inoculation with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), nine of 17 OsMPK genes were found to be induced at the mRNA level during either early, late, or both stages of infection. Four of the M. grisea-induced OsMPK genes were associated with host-cell death in the lesion-mimic rice mutant, and eight of them were differentially induced in response to defense signal molecules such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and ethylene.

It is characterized by black and globose perithecia with a cylindrical neck, two-layered perithecial wall, clavate asci with a refractive apical ring, fusiform to fusoid and septate ascospores, simple hyphopodia, and Phialophora-like anamorph. Species in this genus are necrotrophic parasites infecting roots of grasses. Three new combinations, Magnaporthiopsis poae, M. rhizophila and M. incrustans, are proposed accordingly. Pyricularia is suggested as the generic name for the rice blast fungus over Magnaporthe, following Article 59.1 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants.

18443412,Development of near-isogenic Japonica rice lines with enhanced resistance to Magnaporthe grisea.,"Thirteen near-isogenic lines (NILs) of japonica rice were developed via a backcross method using the recurrent parent Chucheong, which is of good eating quality but is susceptible to Magnaporthe grisea, and three blast resistant japonica donors, Seolak, Daeseong and Bongkwang. The agro-morphological traits of these NILs, such as heading date, culm length, and panicle length, were similar to those of Chucheong. In a genome-wide scan using 158 SSR markers, chromosome segments of Chucheong were identified in most polymorphic regions of the 13 NIL plants, and only a few chromosome segments were found to have been substituted by donor alleles. The genetic similarities of the 13 NILs to the recurrent parent Chucheong averaged 0.961, with a range of 0.932-0.984. Analysis of 13 major blast resistance (R) genes in these lines using specific DNA markers showed that each NIL appeared to contain some combination of the four R genes, Pib, Pii, Pik-m and Pita-2, with the first three genes being present in each line. Screening of nine M. grisea isolates revealed that one NIL M7 was resistant to all nine isolates; the remaining NILs were each resistant to between three and seven isolates, except for NIL M106, which was resistant to only two isolates. In a blast nursery experiment, all the NILs proved to be more resistant than Chucheong. These newly developed NILs have potential as commercial rice varieties because of their increased resistance to M. grisea combined with the desirable agronomic traits of Chucheong. They also provide material for studying the genetic basis of blast resistance.",thirteen nearisogenic line nil japonica rice developed via backcross method using recurrent parent chucheong good eating quality susceptible magnaporthe grisea three blast resistant japonica donor seolak daeseong bongkwang agromorphological trait nil heading date culm length panicle length similar chucheong genomewide scan using ssr marker chromosome segment chucheong identified polymorphic region nil plant chromosome segment found substituted donor allele genetic similarity nil recurrent parent chucheong averaged range analysis major blast resistance r gene line using specific dna marker showed nil appeared contain combination four r gene pib pii pikm pita first three gene present line screening nine grisea isolates revealed one nil resistant nine isolates remaining nil resistant three seven isolates except nil resistant two isolates blast nursery experiment nil proved resistant chucheong newly developed nil potential commercial rice variety increased resistance grisea combined desirable agronomic trait chucheong also provide material studying genetic basis blast resistance,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['backcross method'], 'Symptom': []}",13
26030358,Combination Patterns of Major R Genes Determine the Level of Resistance to the M. oryzae in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating disease of rice and poses a serious threat to world food security. In this study, the distribution and effectiveness of 18 R genes in 277 accessions were investigated based on pathogenicity assays and molecular markers. The results showed that most of the accessions exhibited some degree of resistance (resistance frequency, RF >50%). Accordingly, most of the accessions were observed to harbor two or more R genes, and the number of R genes harbored in accessions was significantly positively correlated with RF. Some R genes were demonstrated to be specifically distributed in the genomes of rice sub-species, such as Pigm, Pi9, Pi5 and Pi1, which were only detected in indica-type accessions, and Pik and Piz, which were just harbored in japonica-type accessions. By analyzing the relationship between R genes and RF using a multiple stepwise regression model, the R genes Pid3, Pi5, Pi9, Pi54, Pigm and Pit were found to show the main effects against M. oryzae in indica-type accessions, while Pita, Pb1, Pik, Pizt and Pia were indicated to exhibit the main effects against M. oryzae in japonica-type accessions. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis revealed that combination patterns of major R genes were the main factors determining the resistance of rice varieties to M. oryzae, such as 'Pi9+Pi54', 'Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pi54+Pid3+Pigm', 'Pi5+Pid3' and 'Pi5+Pit+Pid3' in indica-type accessions and 'Pik+Pib', 'Pik+Pita', 'Pik+Pb1', 'Pizt+Pia' and 'Pizt+Pita' in japonica-type accessions, which were able to confer effective resistance against M. oryzae.

Crop domestication from wild relatives to cultivated species has encompassed significant phenotypic changes. However, little is known about the genetic changes involved in domestication. Here, we surveyed the origin of the Pi-cd locus across Oryza species with AA genomes by comparison with the genome sequences of Hoshinoyume (HS), which does not carry the Pi-cd blast resistance gene, and Kitakurin (KK), which carries the Pi-cd blast resistance gene. We found that variety-specific transposons were enriched at the Pi-cd locus. The genotype of the Pi-cd locus characterized by transposons in HS and KK was specific to each Oryza species with the AA genome. The Kitaake (KT) genotype at the Pi-cd locus found in KK was identical only to that of O. meridionalis and distributed only in subgroups of japonica in the World Rice Collection and tropical japonica in the Japanese Rice Collection, whereas it was not present in O. rufipogon accessions. The distinct distributions of genotypes of the Pi-cd locus clearly demonstrated that the Pi-cd locus was introgressed from O. meridionalis into O. sativa, specific to tropical japonica.",genotype picd locus found blastresistant rice variety kitakurin cultivated rice japan belonging oryza sativa japonica identical wild relative meridionalis crop domestication wild relative cultivated specie encompassed significant phenotypic change however little known genetic change involved domestication surveyed origin picd locus across oryza specie aa genome comparison genome sequence hoshinoyume h carry picd blast resistance gene kitakurin kk carry picd blast resistance gene found varietyspecific transposon enriched picd locus genotype picd locus characterized transposon h kk specific oryza specie aa genome kitaake kt genotype picd locus found kk identical meridionalis distributed subgroup japonica world rice collection tropical japonica japanese rice collection whereas present rufipogon accession distinct distribution genotype picd locus clearly demonstrated picd locus introgressed meridionalis sativa specific tropical japonica,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10
21831477,Magnaporthe oryzae cell wall hydrolysate induces ROS and fungistatic VOCs in rice cell cultures.,"Plants react to microbial attack with a number of defense mechanisms, including the synthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These responses are triggered by elicitors derived from either the cell surface of pathogens or the incomplete hydrolysis of the plant cell wall. Here we show the response of rice (Oryza sativa L., cv Gigante Vercelli) cell cultures following treatment with cell wall hydrolysates prepared from the rice blast Magnaporthe oryzae. Elicitation prompted the production of several plant VOCs, which were analyzed by stir bar sorptive extraction from both the liquid and head-space phase (SBSE and HSSE, respectively) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. VOCs included alkanes, alkenes and long-chain alcohols as well as cinnamyl alcohol, myristicin, a sesquiterpene alcohol (caryolan-1-ol), 1-butanamide and 2-pentylfuran. The major released compounds, 1-octanol and 1-decanol, were found to induce ROS production in both elicited and non-elicited rice cells and showed fungistatic activity against the pathogen M. oryzae.

29630984,Co-evolutionary interactions between host resistance and pathogen avirulence genes in rice-Magnaporthe oryzae pathosystem.,"Rice and Magnaporthe oryzae constitutes an ideal pathosystem for studying host-pathogen interaction in cereals crops. There are two alternative hypotheses, viz. Arms race and Trench warfare, which explain the co-evolutionary dynamics of hosts and pathogens which are under continuous confrontation. Arms race proposes that both R- and Avr- genes of host and pathogen, respectively, undergo positive selection. Alternatively, trench warfare suggests that either R- or Avr- gene in the pathosystem is under balanced selection intending to stabilize the genetic advantage gained over the opposition. Here, we made an attempt to test the above-stated hypotheses in rice-M. oryzae pathosystem at loci of three R-Avr gene pairs, Piz-t-AvrPiz-t, Pi54-AvrPi54 and Pita-AvrPita using allele mining approach. Allele mining is an efficient way to capture allelic variants existing in the population and to study the selective forces imposed on the variants during evolution. Results of nucleotide diversity, neutrality statistics and phylogenetic analyses reveal that Piz-t, Pi54 and AvrPita are diversified and under positive selection at their corresponding loci, while their counterparts, AvrPiz-t, AvrPi54 and Pita are conserved and under balancing selection, in nature. These results imply that rice-M. oryzae populations are engaged in a trench warfare at least at the three R/Avr loci studied. It is a maiden attempt to study the co-evolution of three R-Avr gene pairs in this pathosystem. Knowledge gained from this study will help in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of host-pathogen interaction in a better way and will also aid in developing new durable blast resistant rice varieties in future.",rice magnaporthe oryzae constitutes ideal pathosystem studying hostpathogen interaction cereal crop two alternative hypothesis viz arm race trench warfare explain coevolutionary dynamic host pathogen continuous confrontation arm race proposes r avr gene host pathogen respectively undergo positive selection alternatively trench warfare suggests either r avr gene pathosystem balanced selection intending stabilize genetic advantage gained opposition made attempt test abovestated hypothesis ricem oryzae pathosystem locus three ravr gene pair piztavrpizt piavrpi pitaavrpita using allele mining approach allele mining efficient way capture allelic variant existing population study selective force imposed variant evolution result nucleotide diversity neutrality statistic phylogenetic analysis reveal pizt pi avrpita diversified positive selection corresponding locus counterpart avrpizt avrpi pita conserved balancing selection nature result imply ricem oryzae population engaged trench warfare least three ravr locus studied maiden attempt study coevolution three ravr gene pair pathosystem knowledge gained study help understanding evolutionary dynamic hostpathogen interaction better way also aid developing new durable blast resistant rice variety future,9,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
27837098,Transcription Factor WRKY62 Plays a Role in Pathogen Defense and Hypoxia-Responsive Gene Expression in Rice.,"WRKY62 is a transcriptional repressor regulated downstream of WRKY45, a central transcription factor of the salicylic acid signaling pathway in rice. Previously, WRKY62 was reported to regulate defense negatively. However, our expressional analysis using WRKY62-knockdown rice indicated that WRKY62 positively regulates defense genes, including diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic genes and their transcriptional regulator DPF. Blast and leaf blight resistance tests also showed that WRKY62 is a positive defense regulator. Yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation and gel-shift assays showed that WRKY45 and WRKY62 can form a heterodimer, as well as homodimers, that bind to W-boxes in the DPF promoter. In transient assays in rice sheaths, the simultaneous introduction of WRKY45 and WRKY62 as effectors resulted in a strong activation of the DPF promoter:hrLUC reporter gene, whereas the activity declined with excessive WRKY62. Thus, the WRKY45-WRKY62 heterodimer acts as a strong activator, while the WRKY62 homodimer acts as a repressor. While benzothiadiazole induced equivalent numbers of WRKY45 and WRKY62 transcripts, consistent with heterodimer formation and DPF activation, submergence and nitrogen replacement induced only WRKY62 transcripts, consistent with WRKY62 homodimer formation and DPF repression. Moreover, WRKY62 positively regulated hypoxia genes, implying a role forWRKY62 in the modulation of the 'trade-off' between defense and hypoxia responses.",wrky transcriptional repressor regulated downstream wrky central transcription factor salicylic acid signaling pathway rice previously wrky reported regulate defense negatively however expressional analysis using wrkyknockdown rice indicated wrky positively regulates defense gene including diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthetic gene transcriptional regulator dpf blast leaf blight resistance test also showed wrky positive defense regulator yeast twohybrid coimmunoprecipitation gelshift assay showed wrky wrky form heterodimer well homodimers bind wboxes dpf promoter transient assay rice sheath simultaneous introduction wrky wrky effector resulted strong activation dpf promoterhrluc reporter gene whereas activity declined excessive wrky thus wrkywrky heterodimer act strong activator wrky homodimer act repressor benzothiadiazole induced equivalent number wrky wrky transcript consistent heterodimer formation dpf activation submergence nitrogen replacement induced wrky transcript consistent wrky homodimer formation dpf repression moreover wrky positively regulated hypoxia gene implying role forwrky modulation tradeoff defense hypoxia response,12,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['wrky wrky effector']}",2
11990509,Characterisation of rice anther proteins expressed at the young microspore stage.,"In combination with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) protein mapping and mass spectrometry analysis, the pattern of gene expression in specific tissues at a specific stage can be displayed and characterised. We used this approach for rice (Oryza sativa L. cultivar Doongara) to display and assign identity to proteins in the anthers at the young microspore stage. Over 4000 anther proteins in the pI range of 4-11 and molecular mass range of 6-122 kDa were reproducibly resolved after silver staining, representing about 10% of the estimated total genomic output of rice.

This enabled identification of 53 anther protein spots representing 43 different proteins. Using the publicly available rice expressed sequence tag (EST) database at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information, a further 37 protein spots were matched to ESTs. After BLAST searching with these ESTs, we were able to predict the identity of 22 of these protein spots.

However, more research is needed on the optimal application methods of Pseudomonas mosselii for rice growth, nutrient accumulation, and yield improvement. This research explored the application of the endophytic bacterium P. mosselii PR5 on rice cultivar BRRI dhan29 with four treatments: control, seedling priming, root drenching, and bacterial cell-free culture (CFC) foliar application. PR5 led to better rice growth, improved nutrient acquisition, and higher yields compared to the control, regardless of the application method used. The highest results in fresh weight of root (146.93 g/pot), shoot (758.98 g/pot), and flag leaf (7.88 g/pot), dry weight of root (42.16 g/pot), shoot (97.32 g/pot), and flag leaf (2.69 g/pot), and grains/panicle (224.67), were obtained from seedling priming treatment, whereas root drenching resulted in maximum plant height (105.67 cm), root length (49.0 cm), tillers/pot (23.7), and panicles/pot (17.67). In all three application methods, rice grain yield per pot was higher in PR5 inoculated treatments, compared to the control. The amount of P, Mg and Zn in the shoot and N, P, Ca, Mg and Si content in the flag leaf was significantly increased along with effective suppression of naturally occurring blast disease in bacterial CFC foliar application, validated by multivariate analysis. Our results indicated that rice seedlings priming with PR5 improved rice growth, yield and nutrient uptake, whereas CFC foliar application significantly increased the concentration of most nutrients in the rice plant and suppressed the naturally occurring rice blast disease.

22916136,Comparative analysis of zinc finger proteins involved in plant disease resistance.,"A meta-analysis was performed to understand the role of zinc finger domains in proteins of resistance (R) genes cloned from different crops. We analyzed protein sequences of seventy R genes of various crops in which twenty six proteins were found to have zinc finger domains along with nucleotide binding sites - leucine rice repeats (NBS-LRR) domains. We identified thirty four zinc finger domains in the R proteins of nine crops and were grouped into 19 types of zinc fingers. The size of individual zinc finger domain within the R genes varied from 11 to 84 amino acids, whereas the size of proteins containing these domains varied from 263 to 1305 amino acids. The biophysical analysis revealed that molecular weight of Pi54 zinc finger was lowest whereas the highest one was found in rice Pib zinc finger named as Transposes Transcription Factor (TTF). The instability (R(2) =0.95) and the aliphatic (R(2) =0.94) indices profile of zinc finger domains follows the polynomial distribution pattern.

24158358,Gene editing a constitutively active OsRac1 by homologous recombination-based gene targeting induces immune responses in rice.,"OsRac1 is a member of the plant small GTPase Rac/Rop family and plays a key role in rice immunity. The constitutively active (CA) G19V mutation of OsRac1 was previously shown to induce reactive oxygen species production, phytoalexin synthesis and defense gene activation, leading to resistance to rice blast infection. To study further the effect of the G19V mutation in disease resistance, we introduced a single base substitution by gene targeting and removed the selectable marker using Cre-loxP site-specific recombination. The CA-OsRac1 gene generated by gene targeting was termed CA-gOsRac1. The G19V mutation was transferred from a targeting vector to the OsRac1 locus and stably transmitted to the next generation. In the leaf blade of homozygous CA-gOsRac1 plants, mutant transcript levels were much lower than in those of wild-type plants. In contrast, mutant transcripts in roots, leaf sheaths and panicles were more abundant than those in leaf blades. However, upon chitin treatment, the expression of defense-related genes PAL1 and PBZ1 in the cell culture was greater in the mutants compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, induction of hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death was observed in the leaf sheaths of mutant plants infected with a compatible race of rice blast fungus. In the CA-gOsRac1 plants, a number of genes previously shown to be induced by Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection were induced in the leaf sheath without pathogen infection.

This study investigated the effects of silicon (Si) on the photosynthetic gas exchange parameters (net CO2 assimilation rate [A], stomatal conductance to water vapor [gs], internal-to-ambient CO2 concentration ratio [Ci/Ca], and transpiration rate [E]); chlorophyll fluorescence a (Chla) parameters (maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II [Fv/Fm], photochemical [qP] and nonphotochemical [NPQ] quenching coefficients, and electron transport rate [ETR]); concentrations of pigments, malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), and lypoxigenase (LOX) in rice leaves. Rice plants were grown in a nutrient solution containing 0 or 2 mM Si (-Si or +Si, respectively) with and without P. oryzae inoculation. Blast severity decreased with higher foliar Si concentration. The values of A, gs and E were generally higher for the +Si plants in comparison with the -Si plants upon P. oryzae infection. The Fv/Fm, qp, NPQ, and ETR were greater for the +Si plants relative to the -Si plants at 108 and 132 h after inoculation (hai). The values for qp and ETR were significantly higher for the -Si plants in comparison with the +Si plants at 36 hai, and the NPQ was significantly higher for the -Si plants in comparison with the +Si plants at 0 and 36 hai. The concentrations of Chla, Chlb, Chla+b, and carotenoids were significantly greater in the +Si plants relative to the -Si plants. For the -Si plants, the MDA and H2O2 concentrations were significantly higher than those in the +Si plants. The LOX activity was significantly higher in the +Si plants than in the -Si plants. The SOD and GR activities were significantly higher for the -Si plants than in the +Si plants. The CAT and APX activities were significantly higher in the +Si plants than in the -Si plants. The supply of Si contributed to a decrease in blast severity, improved the gas exchange performance, and caused less dysfunction at the photochemical level.",rice blast caused pyricularia oryzae important disease rice worldwide study investigated effect silicon si photosynthetic gas exchange parameter net co assimilation rate stomatal conductance water vapor g internaltoambient co concentration ratio cica transpiration rate e chlorophyll fluorescence chla parameter maximum photochemical efficiency photosystem ii fvfm photochemical qp nonphotochemical npq quenching coefficient electron transport rate etr concentration pigment malondialdehyde mda hydrogen peroxide ho activity superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx glutathione reductase gr lypoxigenase lox rice leaf rice plant grown nutrient solution containing mm si si si respectively without p oryzae inoculation blast severity decreased higher foliar si concentration value g e generally higher si plant comparison si plant upon p oryzae infection fvfm qp npq etr greater si plant relative si plant h inoculation hai value qp etr significantly higher si plant comparison si plant hai npq significantly higher si plant comparison si plant hai concentration chla chlb chlab carotenoid significantly greater si plant relative si plant si plant mda ho concentration significantly higher si plant lox activity significantly higher si plant si plant sod gr activity significantly higher si plant si plant cat apx activity significantly higher si plant si plant supply si contributed decrease blast severity improved gas exchange performance caused less dysfunction photochemical level,8,"{'Disease': ['pyricularia oryzae important disease rice worldwide study'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",4

The predicated proteins encoded by CIGR1 and CIGR2 possess significant sequence similarity with previously identified members of the GRAS family, such as Arabidopsis SCARECROW, GAI, RGA, tomato Lateral suppressor, and rice SLR1, all of which have VHIID regions, likely to play a role in cellular signaling. Fusions of CIGR1 and CIGR2 with Green Fluorescent Protein were detected exclusively in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells. The expression of CIGR1 and CIGR2 was dependent on the structure of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides, which parallels the structural specificity for chitin binding to the plasma membrane-localized chitin-binding protein, and independent of de novo protein synthesis. Co-cultivation of rice cells with rice blast fungus strongly induced the expression of CIGR1 and CIGR2, whereas inoculation of suspension cells with phytopathogenic bacteria did not.

23621683,Reverse-genetic approach to verify physiological roles of rice phytoalexins: characterization of a knockdown mutant of OsCPS4 phytoalexin biosynthetic gene in rice.,"A variety of labdane-related diterpenoids, including phytocassanes, oryzalexins and momilactones, were identified as phytoalexins in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Momilactone B was also isolated as an allelochemical exuded from rice roots. The biosynthetic genes of these phytoalexins have been identified, including six labdane-related diterpene cyclase genes such as OsCPS2, OsCPS4, OsKSL4, OsKSL7, OsKSL8 and OsKSL10. Here we identified an OsCPS4 knockdown mutant, cps4-tos, by screening Tos17 mutant lines using polymerase chain reaction. OsCPS4 encodes a syn-copalyl diphosphate synthase responsible for momilactones and oryzalexin S biosynthesis. Because Tos17 was inserted into the third intron of OsCPS4, the mature OsCPS4 mRNA was detected in the cps4-tos mutant as well as the wild type. Nevertheless, mature OsCPS4 transcript levels in the cps4-tos mutant were about one sixth those in the wild type. The cps4-tos mutant was more susceptible to rice blast fungus than the wild type, possibly due to lower levels of momilactones and oryzalexin S in the mutant. Moreover, co-cultivation experiments suggested that the allelopathic effect of cps4-tos against some kinds of lowland weeds was significantly lower than that of the wild type, probably because of lower momilactone content exuded from cps4-tos roots. A reverse-genetic strategy using the cps4-tos mutant showed the possible roles of momilactones not only as phytoalexins but also as allelopathic substances.",variety labdanerelated diterpenoids including phytocassanes oryzalexins momilactones identified phytoalexins rice oryza sativa l momilactone b also isolated allelochemical exuded rice root biosynthetic gene phytoalexins identified including six labdanerelated diterpene cyclase gene oscps oscps osksl osksl osksl osksl identified oscps knockdown mutant cpstos screening tos mutant line using polymerase chain reaction oscps encodes syncopalyl diphosphate synthase responsible momilactones oryzalexin biosynthesis tos inserted third intron oscps mature oscps mrna detected cpstos mutant well wild type nevertheless mature oscps transcript level cpstos mutant one sixth wild type cpstos mutant susceptible rice blast fungus wild type possibly due lower level momilactones oryzalexin mutant moreover cocultivation experiment suggested allelopathic effect cpstos kind lowland weed significantly lower wild type probably lower momilactone content exuded cpstos root reversegenetic strategy using cpstos mutant showed possible role momilactones phytoalexins also allelopathic substance,8,"{'Disease': ['mutant susceptible rice blast fungus wild type'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['allelopathic effect cpstos kind lowland weed']}",13
17351054,Magnaporthe grisea infection triggers RNA variation and antisense transcript expression in rice.,"Rice blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is an excellent model system to study plant-fungal interactions and host defense responses. In this study, comprehensive analysis of the rice (Oryza sativa) transcriptome after M. grisea infection was conducted using robust-long serial analysis of gene expression. A total of 83,382 distinct 21-bp robust-long serial analysis of gene expression tags were identified from 627,262 individual tags isolated from the resistant (R), susceptible (S), and control (C) libraries. Sequence analysis revealed that the tags in the R and S libraries had a significant reduced matching rate to the rice genomic and expressed sequences in comparison to the C library. The high level of one-nucleotide mismatches of the R and S library tags was due to nucleotide conversions. The A-to-G and U-to-C nucleotide conversions were the most predominant types, which were induced in the M. grisea-infected plants. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that expression of the adenine deaminase and cytidine deaminase genes was highly induced after inoculation. In addition, many antisense transcripts were induced in infected plants and expression of four antisense transcripts was confirmed by strand-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These results demonstrate that there is a series of dynamic and complex transcript modifications and changes in the rice transcriptome at the M. grisea early infection stages.",rice blast disease caused fungal pathogen magnaporthe grisea excellent model system study plantfungal interaction host defense response study comprehensive analysis rice oryza sativa transcriptome grisea infection conducted using robustlong serial analysis gene expression total distinct bp robustlong serial analysis gene expression tag identified individual tag isolated resistant r susceptible control c library sequence analysis revealed tag r library significant reduced matching rate rice genomic expressed sequence comparison c library high level onenucleotide mismatch r library tag due nucleotide conversion atog utoc nucleotide conversion predominant type induced griseainfected plant reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction analysis showed expression adenine deaminase cytidine deaminase gene highly induced inoculation addition many antisense transcript induced infected plant expression four antisense transcript confirmed strandspecific reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction result demonstrate series dynamic complex transcript modification change rice transcriptome grisea early infection stage,7,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
21781278,Induced Pib Expression and Resistance to Magnaporthe grisea are Compromised by Cytosine Demethylation at Critical Promoter Regions in Rice.,"Pib is a well-characterized rice blast-resistance gene belonging to the nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily. Expression of Pib was low under non-challenged conditions, but strongly induced by the blast-causing fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, thereby conferring resistance to the pathogen. It is generally established that cytosine methylation of the promoter-region often plays a repressive role in modulating expression of the gene in question. We report here that two critical regions of the Pib promoter were heavily CG cytosine-methylated in both cultivars studied. Surprisingly, induced expression of Pib by M. grisea infection did not entail its promoter demethylation, and partial demethylation by 5-azacytidine-treatment actually reduced Pib expression relative to wild-type plants. Accordingly, the blast disease-resistance was compromised in the 5'-azaC-treated plants relative to wild-type. In contrast, the disease susceptibility was not affected by the 5'-azaC treatment in another two rice cultivars that did not contain the Pib gene, ruling out effects of other R genes and non-specific genotoxic effects by the drug-treatment as a cause for the compromised Pib-conditioned blast-resistance. Taken together, our results suggest that promoter DNA methylation plays a novel enhancing role in conditioning high-level of induced expression of the Pib gene in times of M. grisea infection, and its conferred resistance to the pathogen.",pib wellcharacterized rice blastresistance gene belonging nucleotide binding site nb leucinerich repeat lrr superfamily expression pib low nonchallenged condition strongly induced blastcausing fungal pathogen magnaporthe grisea thereby conferring resistance pathogen generally established cytosine methylation promoterregion often play repressive role modulating expression gene question report two critical region pib promoter heavily cg cytosinemethylated cultivar studied surprisingly induced expression pib grisea infection entail promoter demethylation partial demethylation azacytidinetreatment actually reduced pib expression relative wildtype plant accordingly blast diseaseresistance compromised azactreated plant relative wildtype contrast disease susceptibility affected azac treatment another two rice cultivar contain pib gene ruling effect r gene nonspecific genotoxic effect drugtreatment cause compromised pibconditioned blastresistance taken together result suggest promoter dna methylation play novel enhancing role conditioning highlevel induced expression pib gene time grisea infection conferred resistance pathogen,4,"{'Disease': ['diseaseresistance', 'azactreated plant relative wildtype contrast disease susceptibility'], 'Treatment': ['grisea infection entail promoter demethylation partial demethylation azacytidinetreatment', 'azac treatment', 'pib gene ruling effect r gene nonspecific genotoxic effect drugtreatment cause compromised pibconditioned blastresistance'], 'Symptom': ['pib gene ruling effect r gene nonspecific genotoxic effect drugtreatment cause compromised pibconditioned blastresistance']}",10

23938390,Down-regulation of OsSAG12-1 results in enhanced senescence and pathogen-induced cell death in transgenic rice plants.,"Senescence is a highly regulated process accompanied by changes in gene expression. While the mRNA levels of most genes decline, the mRNA levels of specific genes (senescence associated genes, SAGs) increase during senescence. Arabidopsis SAG12 (AtSAG12) gene codes for papain-like cysteine protease. The promoter of AtSAG12 is SA-responsive and reported to be useful to delay senescence by expressing cytokinin biosynthesis gene isopentenyltransferase specifically during senescence in several plants including Arabidopsis, lettuce and rice. The physiological role of AtSAG12 is not known; the homozygous atsag12 mutant neither fails to develop senescenceassociated vacuoles nor shows any morphological phenotype. Through BLAST search using AtSAG12 amino acid sequences as query, we identified a few putative homologues from rice genome (OsSAGs; Oryza sativa SAGs). OsSAG12-1 is the closest homologue of AtSAG12 with 64% similar amino acid composition. Expression of OsSAG12-1 is induced during senescence and pathogen-induced cell death. To evaluate the possible role of OsSAG12-1 we generated RNAi transgenic lines in Japonica rice cultivar TP309.

36354196,"Orco mutagenesis causes deficiencies in olfactory sensitivity and fertility in the migratory brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens.","The migratory brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is the most destructive pest affecting rice plants in Asia and feeds exclusively on rice. Studies have investigated the olfactory response of BPHs to the major rice volatile compounds in rice. The insect olfactory co-receptor (Orco) is a crucial component of the olfactory system and is essential for odorant detection. Functional analysis of the Orco gene in BPHs would aid in the identification of their host preference. We identified the BPH Orco homologue (NlOrco) by Blast searching the BPH transcriptome with the Drosophila Orco gene sequence. Spatiotemporal analysis indicated that NlOrco is first expressed in the later egg stage, and is expressed mainly in the antennae in adult females. A NlOrco-knockout line (NlOrco<sup>-/-</sup> ) was generated through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis. The NlOrco<sup>-/-</sup> mutants showed no response to rice volatile compounds and consequently no host-plant preference. In addition, NlOrco<sup>-/-</sup> mutants exhibited extended nymphal duration and impaired fecundity compared with wild-type BPHs. Our findings indicated that BPHs exhibit strong olfactory responses to major rice volatile compounds and suggest that NlOrco is required for the maximal fitness of BPHs.

10205906,Lesion mimic mutants of rice with alterations in early signaling events of defense.,"We screened 93 lesion mimic mutants of rice for resistance to the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, and found eight mutants that exhibited significant resistance to the fungus. We called these mutants cdr (cell death and resistance) and further analyzed three of them. Two mutations, cdr1 and cdr2, were recessive and one, Cdr3, was dominant. Many small brownish lesions developed over the entire leaf of the mutants 20-50 days after sowing. TUNEL staining revealed that DNA fragmentation occurred in leaf blade cells of the homozygous Cdr3 mutants. Autofluorescence and callose deposition were visible in leaf cells of these three mutants. Activation of two defense-related genes, PBZ1 and PR1, was observed in the leaves of the mutants; high expression of PBZ1 was correlated with the lesion formation in the three mutants, whereas PR1 was constitutively expressed in the cdr2 and Cdr3 mutants irrespective of the lesion formation. Levels of momilactone A, a major phytoalexin of rice, in these mutants were increased approximately 100-400-fold relative to the wild-type levels. Suspension-cultured cells of the cdr1 and cdr2 but not Cdr3 produced higher levels of H2O2 than the wild type when treated with calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1.

19161601,Differential effectiveness of Serratia plymuthica IC1270-induced systemic resistance against hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic leaf pathogens in rice.,"Induced resistance is a state of enhanced defensive capacity developed by a plant reacting to specific biotic or chemical stimuli. Over the years, several forms of induced resistance have been characterized, including systemic acquired resistance, which is induced upon localized infection by an avirulent necrotizing pathogen, and induced systemic resistance (ISR), which is elicited by selected strains of nonpathogenic rhizobacteria. However, contrary to the relative wealth of information on inducible defense responses in dicotyledoneous plants, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying induced resistance phenomena in cereal crops is still in its infancy. Using a combined cytomolecular and pharmacological approach, we analyzed the host defense mechanisms associated with the establishment of ISR in rice by the rhizobacterium Serratia plymuthica IC1270. In a standardized soil-based assay, root treatment with IC1270 rendered foliar tissues more resistant to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, causal agent of the devastating rice blast disease. Analysis of the cytological and biochemical alterations associated with restriction of fungal growth in IC1270-induced plants revealed that IC1270 primes rice for enhanced attacker-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescent phenolic compounds in and near epidermal cells displaying dense cytoplasmic granulation. Similar, yet more abundant, phenotypes of hypersensitively dying cells in the vicinity of fungal hyphae were evident in a gene-for-gene interaction with an avirulent M. oryzae strain, suggesting that IC1270-inducible ISR and R protein conditioned effector-triggered immunity (ETI) target similar defense mechanisms. Yet, this IC1270-inducible ISR response seems to act as a double-edged sword within the rice defense network as induced plants displayed an increased vulnerability to the necrotrophic pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Cochliobolus miyabeanus. Artificial enhancement of ROS levels in inoculated leaves faithfully mimicked the opposite effects of IC1270 bacteria on aforementioned pathogens, suggesting a central role for oxidative events in the IC1270-induced resistance mechanism. Besides identifying ROS as modulators of antagonistic defense mechanisms in rice, this work reveals the mechanistic similarities between S. plymuthica-mediated ISR and R protein-dictated ETI and underscores the importance of using appropriate innate defense mechanisms when breeding for broad-spectrum rice disease resistance.",induced resistance state enhanced defensive capacity developed plant reacting specific biotic chemical stimulus year several form induced resistance characterized including systemic acquired resistance induced upon localized infection avirulent necrotizing pathogen induced systemic resistance isr elicited selected strain nonpathogenic rhizobacteria however contrary relative wealth information inducible defense response dicotyledoneous plant understanding molecular mechanism underlying induced resistance phenomenon cereal crop still infancy using combined cytomolecular pharmacological approach analyzed host defense mechanism associated establishment isr rice rhizobacterium serratia plymuthica ic standardized soilbased assay root treatment ic rendered foliar tissue resistant hemibiotrophic pathogen magnaporthe oryzae causal agent devastating rice blast disease analysis cytological biochemical alteration associated restriction fungal growth icinduced plant revealed ic prime rice enhanced attackerinduced accumulation reactive oxygen specie ro autofluorescent phenolic compound near epidermal cell displaying dense cytoplasmic granulation similar yet abundant phenotype hypersensitively dying cell vicinity fungal hypha evident geneforgene interaction avirulent oryzae strain suggesting icinducible isr r protein conditioned effectortriggered immunity eti target similar defense mechanism yet icinducible isr response seems act doubleedged sword within rice defense network induced plant displayed increased vulnerability necrotrophic pathogen rhizoctonia solani cochliobolus miyabeanus artificial enhancement ro level inoculated leaf faithfully mimicked opposite effect ic bacteria aforementioned pathogen suggesting central role oxidative event icinduced resistance mechanism besides identifying ro modulators antagonistic defense mechanism rice work reveals mechanistic similarity plymuthicamediated isr r proteindictated eti underscore importance using appropriate innate defense mechanism breeding broadspectrum rice disease resistance,4,"{'Disease': ['broadspectrum rice disease resistance'], 'Treatment': ['soilbased assay root treatment ic'], 'Symptom': ['effectortriggered immunity', 'increased vulnerability necrotrophic pathogen rhizoctonia solani cochliobolus miyabeanus artificial enhancement ro level inoculated leaf faithfully mimicked opposite effect']}",8
39585916,Membrane fluidity control by the Magnaporthe oryzae acyl-CoA binding protein sets the thermal range for host rice cell colonization.,"Following leaf cuticle penetration by specialized appressorial cells, the devastating blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae grows as invasive hyphae (IH) in living rice cells. IH are separated from host cytoplasm by plant-derived membranes forming an apoplastic compartment and a punctate biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) that mediate the molecular host-pathogen interaction. What molecular and cellular processes determine the temperature range for this biotrophic growth stage is an unanswered question pertinent to a broader understanding of how phytopathogens may cope with environmental stresses arising under climate change. Here, we shed light on thermal adaptation in M. oryzae by disrupting the ACB1 gene encoding the single acyl-CoA-binding protein, an intracellular transporter of long-chain acyl-CoA esters. Loss of ACB1 affected fatty acid desaturation levels and abolished pathogenicity at optimal (26°C) and low (22°C) but not elevated (29°C) infection temperatures (the latter following post-penetration shifts from 26°C). Relative to wild type, the Δacb1 mutant strain exhibited poor vegetative growth and impaired membrane trafficking at 22°C and 26°C, but not at 29°C. In planta, Δacb1 biotrophic growth was inhibited at 26°C-which was accompanied by a multi-BIC phenotype-but not at 29°C, where BIC formation was normal. Underpinning the Δacb1 phenotype was impaired membrane fluidity at 22°C and 26°C but not at elevated temperatures, indicating Acb1 suppresses membrane rigidity at optimal- and suboptimal- but not supraoptimal temperatures. Deducing a temperature-dependent role for Acb1 in maintaining membrane fluidity homeostasis reveals how the thermal range for rice blast disease is both mechanistically determined and wider than hitherto appreciated.",following leaf cuticle penetration specialized appressorial cell devastating blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae grows invasive hypha ih living rice cell ih separated host cytoplasm plantderived membrane forming apoplastic compartment punctate biotrophic interfacial complex bic mediate molecular hostpathogen interaction molecular cellular process determine temperature range biotrophic growth stage unanswered question pertinent broader understanding phytopathogens may cope environmental stress arising climate change shed light thermal adaptation oryzae disrupting acb gene encoding single acylcoabinding protein intracellular transporter longchain acylcoa ester loss acb affected fatty acid desaturation level abolished pathogenicity optimal °c low °c elevated °c infection temperature latter following postpenetration shift °c relative wild type δacb mutant strain exhibited poor vegetative growth impaired membrane trafficking °c °c °c planta δacb biotrophic growth inhibited °cwhich accompanied multibic phenotypebut °c bic formation normal underpinning δacb phenotype impaired membrane fluidity °c °c elevated temperature indicating acb suppresses membrane rigidity optimal suboptimal supraoptimal temperature deducing temperaturedependent role acb maintaining membrane fluidity homeostasis reveals thermal range rice blast disease mechanistically determined wider hitherto appreciated,3,"{'Disease': ['leaf cuticle penetration specialized appressorial cell devastating blast fungus', 'thermal range rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

Besides, we also aimed at understanding the growth, multiple stress response and pathogenicity in <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. We isolated <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> DL76 from a rice farm, which observed a strong antimicrobial effect on <i>M. oryzae</i>. The sterilized culture filtrate of DL76 inhibited the growth of <i>M. oryzae</i>, which motivated us to deduce the influence of DL76 on the pathogenicity of <i>M. oryzae</i>. We screened the effect of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> DL76 on <i>M. oryzae</i> guy11. It demonstrated that sterilized culture filtrate (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL) of DL76 can delay and even suppress the germination of conidia and (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) prevent the formation of appressorium in vitro and in vivo. DL76 became hypersensitive to osmotic, oxidative, and cell wall degrading agents. In addition, the relative transcript levels of stress-responsive genes oxidative and osmotic were down-regulated by DL76 except for <i>sod1</i>, <i>cat1</i>, and <i>cat2</i>. In vivo assessment of the antifungal activity of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> using conidia suspension of DL76 reduced the incidence and severity of rice blast. Conclusively, our results show that DL76 is essential for controlling rice blast by inhibiting conidiation, growth, multiple stress tolerance, and pathogenicity in <i>M. oryzae.</i>",recent year biological control gained attention promising method combat plant disease severe disease cited include rice blast caused imagnaporthe oryzaei however effective microbial strain strong adaptability still need identified therefore sought assess conidium germination formation appressorium dl imagnaporthe oryzaei besides also aimed understanding growth multiple stress response pathogenicity imagnaporthe oryzaei isolated ibacillus subtilisi dl rice farm observed strong antimicrobial effect im oryzaei sterilized culture filtrate dl inhibited growth im oryzaei motivated u deduce influence dl pathogenicity im oryzaei screened effect ibacillus subtilisi dl im oryzaei guy demonstrated sterilized culture filtrate × supsup cfuml dl delay even suppress germination conidium × supsup × supsup cfuml prevent formation appressorium vitro vivo dl became hypersensitive osmotic oxidative cell wall degrading agent addition relative transcript level stressresponsive gene oxidative osmotic downregulated dl except isodi icati icati vivo assessment antifungal activity ibacillus subtilisi using conidium suspension dl reduced incidence severity rice blast conclusively result show dl essential controlling rice blast inhibiting conidiation growth multiple stress tolerance pathogenicity im oryzaei,11,"{'Disease': ['promising method combat plant disease severe disease'], 'Treatment': ['promising method combat plant disease severe disease'], 'Symptom': ['strong antimicrobial effect']}",3
29566164,"LML1, Encoding a Conserved Eukaryotic Release Factor 1 Protein, Regulates Cell Death and Pathogen Resistance by Forming a Conserved Complex with SPL33 in Rice.","Lesion mimic mutants are powerful tools for unveiling the molecular connections between cell death and pathogen resistance. Various proteins responsible for lesion mimics have been identified; however, the mechanisms underlying lesion formation and pathogen resistance are still unknown. Here, we identify a lesion mimic mutant in rice, lesion mimic leaf 1 (lml1). The lml1 mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast. LML1 is expressed in all types of leaf cells, and encodes a novel eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein sequences of LML1 orthologs are conserved in yeast, animals and plants. LML1 can partially rescue the growth delay phenotype of the LML1 yeast ortholog mutant, dom34. Both lml1 and mutants of AtLML1 (the LML1 Arabidopsis ortholog) exhibited a growth delay phenotype like dom34. This indicates that LML1 and its orthologs are functionally conserved. LML1 forms a functional complex with a eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A)-like protein, SPL33/LMM5.1, whose mutant phenotype was similar to the lml1 phenotype. This complex was conserved between rice and yeast. Our work provides new insight into understanding the mechanism of cell death and pathogen resistance, and also lays a good foundation for studying the fundamental molecular function of Pelota/DOM34 and its orthologs in plants.",lesion mimic mutant powerful tool unveiling molecular connection cell death pathogen resistance various protein responsible lesion mimic identified however mechanism underlying lesion formation pathogen resistance still unknown identify lesion mimic mutant rice lesion mimic leaf lml lml mutant exhibited abnormal cell death resistance bacterial blight rice blast lml expressed type leaf cell encodes novel eukaryotic release factor erf protein located endoplasmic reticulum protein sequence lml orthologs conserved yeast animal plant lml partially rescue growth delay phenotype lml yeast ortholog mutant dom lml mutant atlml lml arabidopsis ortholog exhibited growth delay phenotype like dom indicates lml orthologs functionally conserved lml form functional complex eukaryotic elongation factor eefalike protein spllmm whose mutant phenotype similar lml phenotype complex conserved rice yeast work provides new insight understanding mechanism cell death pathogen resistance also lay good foundation studying fundamental molecular function pelotadom orthologs plant,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
27935243,MoCDC14 is important for septation during conidiation and appressorium formation in Magnaporthe oryzae.,"As a typical foliar pathogen, appressorium formation and penetration are critical steps in the infection cycle of Magnaporthe oryzae. Because appressorium formation and penetration are closely co-regulated with the cell cycle, and Cdc14 phosphatases have an antagonistic relationship with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) on proteins related to mitotic exit and cytokinesis, in this study, we functionally characterized the MoCDC14 gene in M. oryzae. The Mocdc14 deletion mutant showed significantly reduced growth rate and conidiation. It was also defective in septum formation and nuclear distribution. Septation was irregular in Mocdc14 hyphae and hyphal compartments became multi-nucleate. Mutant conidia often showed incomplete septa or lacked any septum. During appressorium formation, the septum delimiting appressoria from the rest of the germ tubes was often formed far away from the neck of the appressoria or not formed at all. Unlike the wild-type, some mutant appressoria had more than one nucleus at 24 h. In addition to appressoria, melanization occurred on parts of the germ tubes and conidia, depending on the irregular position of the appressorium-delimiting septum. The Mocdc14 mutant was also defective in glycogen degradation during appressorium formation and appressorial penetration of intact plant cells. Similar defects in septum formation, melanization and penetration were observed with appressorium-like structures formed at hyphal tips in the Mocdc14 mutant. Often a long fragment of mutant hyphae was melanized, together with the apical appressorium-like structures. These results indicate that MoCDC14 plays a critical role in septation, nuclear distribution and pathogenesis in M. oryzae, and correct septum formation during conidiogenesis and appressorium formation requires the MoCdc14 phosphatase.",typical foliar pathogen appressorium formation penetration critical step infection cycle magnaporthe oryzae appressorium formation penetration closely coregulated cell cycle cdc phosphatase antagonistic relationship cyclindependent kinase cdks protein related mitotic exit cytokinesis study functionally characterized mocdc gene oryzae mocdc deletion mutant showed significantly reduced growth rate conidiation also defective septum formation nuclear distribution septation irregular mocdc hypha hyphal compartment became multinucleate mutant conidium often showed incomplete septum lacked septum appressorium formation septum delimiting appressoria rest germ tube often formed far away neck appressoria formed unlike wildtype mutant appressoria one nucleus h addition appressoria melanization occurred part germ tube conidium depending irregular position appressoriumdelimiting septum mocdc mutant also defective glycogen degradation appressorium formation appressorial penetration intact plant cell similar defect septum formation melanization penetration observed appressoriumlike structure formed hyphal tip mocdc mutant often long fragment mutant hypha melanized together apical appressoriumlike structure result indicate mocdc play critical role septation nuclear distribution pathogenesis oryzae correct septum formation conidiogenesis appressorium formation requires mocdc phosphatase,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

Until now, little is known about the evolutionary and ecological factors driving compatibility ranges in systems implicating crop plants. We studied the evolution of host and pathogen compatibility ranges for rice blast disease, which is caused by the ascomycete Magnaporthe oryzae. We challenged 61 rice varieties from three rice subspecies with 31 strains of M. oryzae collected worldwide from all major known genetic groups. We determined the compatibility range of each plant variety and pathogen genotype and the severity of each plant-pathogen interaction. Compatibility ranges differed between rice subspecies, with the most resistant subspecies selecting for pathogens with broader compatibility ranges and the least resistant subspecies selecting for pathogens with narrower compatibility ranges. These results are consistent with a nested distribution of R genes between rice subspecies.",efficient strategy limiting impact pathogen crop require good understanding factor underlying evolution compatibility range pathogen host plant ie set host genotype particular pathogen genotype infect set pathogen genotype infect particular host genotype little known evolutionary ecological factor driving compatibility range system implicating crop plant studied evolution host pathogen compatibility range rice blast disease caused ascomycete magnaporthe oryzae challenged rice variety three rice subspecies strain oryzae collected worldwide major known genetic group determined compatibility range plant variety pathogen genotype severity plantpathogen interaction compatibility range differed rice subspecies resistant subspecies selecting pathogen broader compatibility range least resistant subspecies selecting pathogen narrower compatibility range result consistent nested distribution r gene rice subspecies,1,"{'Disease': ['evolution host pathogen compatibility range rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['efficient strategy limiting impact pathogen crop']}",1

Root inoculation of the monocot model rice with 7NSK2 partially protected leaves against blast disease (Magnaporthe grisea) but failed to consistently reduce sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani). Only mutations interfering with pyocyanin production led to a significant decrease in induced systemic resistance (ISR) to M. grisea, and in trans complementation for pyocyanin production restored the ability to elicit ISR. Intriguingly, pyocyanin-deficient mutants, unlike the wild type, triggered ISR against R. solani. Hence, bacterial pyocyanin plays a differential role in 7NSK2-mediated ISR in rice. Application of purified pyocyanin to hydroponically grown rice seedlings increased H202 levels locally on the root surface as well as a biphasic H202 generation pattern in distal leaves. Co-application of pyocyanin and the antioxidant sodium ascorbate alleviated the opposite effects of pyocyanin on rice blast and sheath blight development, suggesting that the differential effectiveness of pyocyanin with respect to 7NSK2-triggered ISR is mediated by transiently elevated H202 levels in planta. The cumulative results suggest that reactive oxygen species act as a double-edged sword in the interaction of rice with the hemibiotroph M. grisea and the necrotroph R. solani.",pseudomonas aeruginosa nsk induces resistance dicot synergistic interaction phenazine pyocyanin salicylic acidderivative pyochelin root inoculation monocot model rice nsk partially protected leaf blast disease magnaporthe grisea failed consistently reduce sheath blight rhizoctonia solani mutation interfering pyocyanin production led significant decrease induced systemic resistance isr grisea trans complementation pyocyanin production restored ability elicit isr intriguingly pyocyanindeficient mutant unlike wild type triggered isr r solani hence bacterial pyocyanin play differential role nskmediated isr rice application purified pyocyanin hydroponically grown rice seedling increased h level locally root surface well biphasic h generation pattern distal leaf coapplication pyocyanin antioxidant sodium ascorbate alleviated opposite effect pyocyanin rice blast sheath blight development suggesting differential effectiveness pyocyanin respect nsktriggered isr mediated transiently elevated h level planta cumulative result suggest reactive oxygen specie act doubleedged sword interaction rice hemibiotroph grisea necrotroph r solani,4,"{'Disease': ['partially protected leaf blast disease magnaporthe grisea'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect']}",11

Flagellin from a phytopathogenic bacterium, Acidovorax avenae strain N1141, induces immune responses in suspension-cultured rice cells. To analyse the function of flagellin in rice, we fused the N1141 flagellin gene to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and introduced it into rice. Many of the resulting transgenic rice plants accumulated flagellin at various levels. The transgenic rice developed pale spots in the leaves. The expression of a defence-related gene for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was induced in the transgenic plants, and H(2)O(2) production and cell death were observed in some plants with high levels of gene expression, suggesting that the flagellin triggers immune responses in the transgenic rice.

18071364,Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants.,"WRKY transcription factors have many regulatory roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene (OsWRKY31) that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 211 amino-acid residues and belongs to a subgroup of the rice WRKY gene family that probably originated after the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. OsWRKY31 was found to be localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells to transiently express OsWRKY31-eGFP fusion protein. Analysis of OsWRKY31 and its mutants fused with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain indicated that OsWRKY31 has transactivation activity in yeast. Overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene was found to enhance resistance against infection with M. grisea, and the transgenic lines exhibited reduced lateral root formation and elongation compared with wild-type and RNAi plants. The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes. Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4-D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport.

18257679,OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact and function in rice basal disease resistance.,"The RAR1 and SGT1 proteins function synergistically or antagonistically in plant innate immune responses. Here, we show that the rice orthologs OsRAR1 and OsSGT1 physically interact in vivo and in yeast. They displayed conserved roles in Arabidopsis disease resistance through ectopic expression in the Arabidopsis rar1 and sgt1 mutants. Overexpression of OsRar1 and OsSGT1 in rice significantly increased basal resistance to a virulent bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99 but not to another virulent strain DY89031, suggesting race-specific-like basal resistance conferred by OsRar1 and OsSGT1. OsRar1-OE and OsSGT1-OE plants also enhanced resistance to all four virulent blast fungal Magnaporthe oryzae races. Overexpression of the OsSGT1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion most likely caused a dominant negative phenotype which led to race-specific-like basal resistance. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsSGT1-GFP show enhanced resistance to DY89031 but decreased resistance to PXO99, implying that OsSGT1 might be the target of a component required for DY89031 virulence or OsSGT1-GFP might stabilize weak resistance proteins against DY89031. Consistent with the hypothesis of the dominant negative regulation, we observed the reduced sensitivity to auxin of OsSGT1-GFP plants compared with the wild-type ones, and the curling-root phenotype in OsSGT1-OE plants. These results collectively suggest that OsRar1 and OsSGT1 might be differentially required for rice basal disease resistance.

19011003,A germin-like protein gene family functions as a complex quantitative trait locus conferring broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.,"Plant disease resistance governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) is predicted to be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens and long lasting. Use of these QTL to improve crop species, however, is hindered because the genes contributing to the trait are not known. Five disease resistance QTL that colocalized with defense response genes were accumulated by marker-aided selection to develop blast-resistant varieties. One advanced backcross line carrying the major-effect QTL on chromosome (chr) 8, which included a cluster of 12 germin-like protein (OsGLP) gene members, exhibited resistance to rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease over 14 cropping seasons. To determine if OsGLP members contribute to resistance and if the resistance was broad spectrum, a highly conserved portion of the OsGLP coding region was used as an RNA interference trigger to silence a few to all expressed chr 8 OsGLP family members. Challenge with two different fungal pathogens (causal agents of rice blast and sheath blight diseases) revealed that as more chr 8 OsGLP genes were suppressed, disease susceptibility of the plants increased. Of the 12 chr 8 OsGLPs, one clustered subfamily (OsGER4) contributed most to resistance. The similarities of sequence, gene organization, and roles in disease resistance of GLP family members in rice and other cereals, including barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), suggest that resistance contributed by the chr 8 OsGLP is a broad-spectrum, basal mechanism conserved among the Gramineae.

14605807,Isolation and characterization of novel defense response genes involved in compatible and incompatible interactions between rice and Magnaporthe grisea.,"To identify early-induced defense genes involved in broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast, suppression subtractive hybridization was used to generate two cDNA libraries enriched for transcripts differentially expressed in Pi9(t)-resistant and -susceptible plants. After differential screening by membrane-based hybridization and subsequent confirmation by reverse Northern blot analysis, selected clones were sequenced and analyzed. Forty-seven unique cDNA clones were found and assigned to eight different groups according to the putative function of their homologous genes in the database. These genes may be involved in pathogen or stress response, signal transduction, transcription, cell transport, metabolism, energy or protein destination. Northern blot analysis showed that most of these genes were induced or suppressed after blast infection, and that half of them showed differential expression patterns between compatible and incompatible interactions. Interestingly, all but one of the identified genes are reported here for the first time to be involved in defense response to rice blast. In addition, hybridization of these clones with cDNAs synthesized from RNA samples from bacterial blight-infected leaves showed that few of them are induced or repressed in Xa21- or Xa7-resistant plants, suggesting a minimum overlap of defense responses mediated by different resistance genes to fungal and bacterial pathogens at an early stage of infection.

25849162,The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.,"Rice blast disease is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. We previously cloned the rice blast resistance gene Pid2, which encodes a transmembrane receptor-like kinase containing an extracellular B-lectin domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain. However, little is known about Pid2-mediated signaling. Here we report the functional characterization of the U-box/ARM repeat protein OsPUB15 as one of the PID2-binding proteins. We found that OsPUB15 physically interacted with the kinase domain of PID2 (PID2K) in vitro and in vivo and the ARM repeat domain of OsPUB15 was essential for the interaction. In vitro biochemical assays indicated that PID2K possessed kinase activity and was able to phosphorylate OsPUB15. We also found that the phosphorylated form of OsPUB15 possessed E3 ligase activity. Expression pattern analyses revealed that OsPUB15 was constitutively expressed and its encoded protein OsPUB15 was localized in cytosol. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsPUB15 at early stage displayed cell death lesions spontaneously in association with a constitutive activation of plant basal defense responses, including excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, up-regulated expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to blast strains. We also observed that, along with plant growth, the cell death lesions kept spreading over the whole seedlings quickly resulting in a seedling lethal phenotype.

12838393,"Identification and fine mapping of Pi33, the rice resistance gene corresponding to the Magnaporthe grisea avirulence gene ACE1.","Rice blast disease is a major constraint for rice breeding. Nevertheless, the genetic basis of resistance remains poorly understood for most rice varieties, and new resistance genes remain to be identified. We identified the resistance gene corresponding to the cloned avirulence gene ACE1 using pairs of isogenic strains of Magnaporthe grisea differing only by their ACE1 allele. This resistance gene was mapped on the short arm of rice chromosome 8 using progenies from the crosses IR64 (resistant) x Azucena (susceptible) and Azucena x Bala (resistant). The isogenic strains also permitted the detection of this resistance gene in several rice varieties, including the differential isogenic line C101LAC. Allelism tests permitted us to distinguish this gene from two other resistance genes [ Pi11 and Pi-29(t)] that are present on the short arm of chromosome 8.

In this paper, these cerebroside elicitors showed phytoalexin-inducing activity when applied to plants by spray treatment and also induced the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in rice leaves. This elicitor activity of the cerebrosides showed the structural specificity as that for the induction of phytoalexins. Ceramides prepared from the cerebrosides by removal of glucose also showed the elicitor activity even in lower level compared to the cerebrosides. In field experiments, the cerebroside elicitors effectively protected rice plants against the rice blast fungus, an economically devastating agent of disease of rice in Japan.

18315698,Abscisic acid regulates gene expression in cortical fiber cells and silica cells of rice shoots.,"Drought-induced growth arrest is a major cause of yield loss in crops and is mediated in part by abscisic acid (ABA). The aim of this study was to identify the cell types targeted by ABA during arrest. As transcription factors ABI3 and ABI5 are essential for ABA-induced growth arrest in Arabidopsis, blast was used to identify OsVP1 and OsABF1 as their structural orthologues in rice (Oryza sativa), and employed RNA in situ hybridization to reveal the cell types accumulating the corresponding transcripts in response to ABA. Exogenous ABA arrested the growth of leaves 1, 2 and 3 in young rice shoots and inhibited secondary cell-wall formation in sclerenchyma, including expression of the cellulose synthase gene OsCesA9. Transcripts for OsVP1, OsABF1 and of the putative target genes OsEm, OsLEA3 and WSI18, increased under ABA, accumulating principally in the cytosol of the major support cells (sclerenchymatous cortical fiber cells and epidermal silica cells) of slowly growing leaf 1. Rapidly growing immature tissues in leaves 2 and 3 accumulated OsABF1, OsEm and WSI18 transcripts in the nuclei of all cells, irrespective of ABA treatment. It is concluded that during arrest of leaf growth, ABA targets support cells in maturing tissues.

Pre- and postinoculation treatments of this herbicide reduced disease development. Glufosinate ammonium specifically impeded appressorium formation of the pathogens Magnaporthe grisea and Cochliobolus miyabeanus on hydrophobic surface and on transgenic rice. In contrast, conidial germination remained unaffected. Glufosinate ammonium diminished mycelial growth of two pathogens; however, this inhibitory effect was attenuated in malnutrition conditions. Glufosinate ammonium caused slight chlorosis and diminished chlorophyll content; however, these alterations were almost completely restored in transgenic rice within 7 d. Glufosinate ammonium triggered transcriptions of PATHOGENESIS-RELATED (PR) genes and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in transgenic rice and PR1 transcription in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) wild-type ecotype Columbia harboring 35S:bar construct. All transgenic Arabidopsis showed robust hydrogen peroxide accumulation by glufosinate ammonium. This herbicide also induced PR1 transcription in etr1 and jar1 expressing bar; however, no expression was observed in NahG and npr1. Fungal infection did not alter transcriptions of PR genes and hydrogen peroxide accumulation induced by glufosinate ammonium. Infiltration of glufosinate ammonium did not affect appressorium formation of M. grisea in vivo but inhibited blast disease development.

21364321,Enhancement of MAMP signaling by chimeric receptors improves disease resistance in plants.,"Plants activate defense responses through the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Recently, several pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) have been identified in plants, paving the way for manipulating MAMP signaling. CEBiP is a receptor for the chitin elicitor (CE) identified in the rice plasma membrane and XA21 is a member of the receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) family that confers disease resistance to rice bacterial leaf blight expressing the sulfated protein Ax21. To improve resistance to rice blast, the most serious fungal disease of rice, we aimed to create a defense system that combines high affinity of CEBiP for CE and the ability of XA21 to confer disease resistance. Cultured rice cells expressing the chimeric receptor CRXA, which consists of CEBiP and the intracellular region of XA21, induced cell death accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species after exposure to CE. Rice plants expressing the chimeric receptor exhibited more resistance to rice blast.

24885019,Genomic regions involved in yield potential detected by genome-wide association analysis in Japanese high-yielding rice cultivars.,"High-yielding cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa L.) have been developed in Japan from crosses between overseas indica and domestic japonica cultivars. Recently, next-generation sequencing technology and high-throughput genotyping systems have shown many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are proving useful for detailed analysis of genome composition. These SNPs can be used in genome-wide association studies to detect candidate genome regions associated with economically important traits. In this study, we used a custom SNP set to identify introgressed chromosomal regions in a set of high-yielding Japanese rice cultivars, and we performed an association study to identify genome regions associated with yield. An informative set of 1152 SNPs was established by screening 14 high-yielding or primary ancestral cultivars for 5760 validated SNPs. Analysis of the population structure of high-yielding cultivars showed three genome types: japonica-type, indica-type and a mixture of the two. SNP allele frequencies showed several regions derived predominantly from one of the two parental genome types. Distinct regions skewed for the presence of parental alleles were observed on chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 8, 11 and 12 (indica) and on chromosomes 1, 2 and 6 (japonica). A possible relationship between these introgressed regions and six yield traits (blast susceptibility, heading date, length of unhusked seeds, number of panicles, surface area of unhusked seeds and 1000-grain weight) was detected in eight genome regions dominated by alleles of one parental origin. Two of these regions were near Ghd7, a heading date locus, and Pi-ta, a blast resistance locus. The allele types (i.e., japonica or indica) of significant SNPs coincided with those previously reported for candidate genes Ghd7 and Pi-ta. Introgression breeding is an established strategy for the accumulation of QTLs and genes controlling high yield. Our custom SNP set is an effective tool for the identification of introgressed genome regions from a particular genetic background.

18943255,A fragment of the Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola harpin HpaG Xooc reduces disease and increases yield of rice in extensive grower plantings.,"Harpins of phytopathogenic bacteria stimulate defense and plant growth in many types of plants, conferring disease resistance and enhanced yield. In a previous study, we characterized nine fragments of the harpin protein HpaG(Xooc) from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola for plant defense elicitation and plant growth stimulation activity relative to the intact protein. In plants grown under controlled conditions, the fragment HpaG10-42 was more active in both regards than HpaG(Xooc). Here, we demonstrate that the activity of HpaG10-42 in rice under field conditions significantly exceeds that of HpaG(Xooc), stimulating resistance to three important diseases and increasing grain yield. We carried out tests in 672 experimental plots with nine cultivars of rice planted at three locations. Application protocols were optimized by testing variations in application rate, frequency, and timing with respect to rice growth stage. Of the concentrations (24, 24, 12, and 6 microg/ml), and number and timing of applications (at one to four different stages of growth) tested, HpaG10-42 at 6 microg/ml applied to plants once at nursery seedling stage and three times in the field was most effective. Bacterial blight, rice blast, and sheath blight were reduced 61.6 and 56.4, 93.6 and 76.0, and 93.2 and 55.0% in indica and japonica cultivars, respectively, relative to controls. Grain yields were 22 to 27% greater.

To evaluate possible risks associated with pollen-mediated transgene dispersal, we conducted a two-year survey in Vietnam to examine overlapping flowering periods of rice (Oryza sativa L.), weedy rice (O. sativa), and wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.), all of which are inter-fertile. We surveyed populations in two regions of the Mekong Delta, northern and southern, and at three sites in each of three habitats per region: fresh water, saline water, and acid sulfate soil. Weedy rice frequently flowered simultaneously with neighboring cultivated rice plants. Flowering was more seasonal in wild rice and often peaked in November and December. Peak flowering times of wild rice overlapped with adjacent rice fields at all of the saline sites and half of the acid sulfate sites. The longer flowering season of wild rice ensured that crop-to-wild gene flow was possible in fresh water habitats as well. Our second objective was to determine whether wild and weedy rice populations are exposed to pests that could be targeted by future transgenes, which may then provide fitness benefits. These populations shared many pathogen and insect herbivore species with cultivated rice (leaffolder, locust, cricket, planthoppers, rice bug, stem borer, sheath blight, blast, bacterial leaf blight, and brown spot). Damage by leaffolders and locusts was the most frequently observed insect feeding damage on all three rice types. Indicator species analysis revealed that most of the insect herbivores were associated with particular habitats, demonstrating the importance of broad geographic sampling for transgenic rice risk assessment. These survey data and the strong likelihood of gene flow from cultivated rice suggest that further studies are needed to examine the effects of transgenic traits such as resistance to pests on the abundance of wild and weedy rice.",many variety transgenic rice development country wild weedy relative cooccur crop evaluate possible risk associated pollenmediated transgene dispersal conducted twoyear survey vietnam examine overlapping flowering period rice oryza sativa l weedy rice sativa wild rice rufipogon griff interfertile surveyed population two region mekong delta northern southern three site three habitat per region fresh water saline water acid sulfate soil weedy rice frequently flowered simultaneously neighboring cultivated rice plant flowering seasonal wild rice often peaked november december peak flowering time wild rice overlapped adjacent rice field saline site half acid sulfate site longer flowering season wild rice ensured croptowild gene flow possible fresh water habitat well second objective determine whether wild weedy rice population exposed pest could targeted future transgene may provide fitness benefit population shared many pathogen insect herbivore specie cultivated rice leaffolder locust cricket planthopper rice bug stem borer sheath blight blast bacterial leaf blight brown spot damage leaffolders locust frequently observed insect feeding damage three rice type indicator specie analysis revealed insect herbivore associated particular habitat demonstrating importance broad geographic sampling transgenic rice risk assessment survey data strong likelihood gene flow cultivated rice suggest study needed examine effect transgenic trait resistance pest abundance wild weedy rice,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['needed examine effect transgenic trait resistance']}",0
8049366,Isolation of a monocot 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase gene that is elicitor-inducible.,"The rice (Oryza sativa) phytoalexins, momilactones and oryzalexins, are synthesized by the isoprenoid pathway. An early step in this pathway, one that is rate-limiting in mammalian systems, is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). A gene that encodes this enzyme has been isolated from rice, and found to contain an open reading frame of 1527 bases. The encoded protein sequence of the rice HMGR appears to be conserved with respect to other HMGR proteins, and 1 or 2 membrane-spanning domains characteristic of plant HMGRs are predicted by a hydropathy plot of the amino acid sequence. The protein is truncated at its 5' end, and shows reduced sequence conservation in this region as compared to other plant sequences. The rice genome contains a small family of HMGR genes. The isolated gene, HMGR I, is expressed at low levels in both vegetative and floral organs of rice plants. It is not induced in plants by wounding, but is strongly and rapidly induced in suspension cells by a fungal cell wall elicitor from the pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of rice blast disease. This suggests that HMGR I may be important in the induction of rice phytoalexin biosynthesis in response to pathogen attack, and therefore may play a key role as a component of the inducible defense mechanism in rice.",rice oryza sativa phytoalexins momilactones oryzalexins synthesized isoprenoid pathway early step pathway one ratelimiting mammalian system catalyzed enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme reductase hmgr gene encodes enzyme isolated rice found contain open reading frame base encoded protein sequence rice hmgr appears conserved respect hmgr protein membranespanning domain characteristic plant hmgrs predicted hydropathy plot amino acid sequence protein truncated end show reduced sequence conservation region compared plant sequence rice genome contains small family hmgr gene isolated gene hmgr expressed low level vegetative floral organ rice plant induced plant wounding strongly rapidly induced suspension cell fungal cell wall elicitor pathogen magnaporthe grisea causal agent rice blast disease suggests hmgr may important induction rice phytoalexin biosynthesis response pathogen attack therefore may play key role component inducible defense mechanism rice,4,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe grisea causal agent rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

While several studies target these stresses independently, breeding strategies to combat multiple stresses seldom exist. This study reports an integrated strategy that combines QTL mapping and phenotypic selection to develop rice lines with high grain yield (GY) under drought stress and non-stress conditions, and tolerance of rice blast. A blast-tolerant BC2F3-derived population was developed from the cross of tropical japonica cultivar Moroberekan (blast- and drought-tolerant) and high-yielding indica variety Swarna (blast- and drought-susceptible) through phenotypic selection for blast tolerance at the BC2F2 generation. The population was studied for segregation distortion patterns and QTLs for GY under drought were identified along with study of epistatic interactions for the trait. Segregation distortion, in favour of Moroberekan, was observed at 50 of the 59 loci. Majority of these marker loci co-localized with known QTLs for blast tolerance or NBS-LRR disease resistance genes. Despite the presence of segregation distortion, high variation for DTF, PH and GY was observed and several QTLs were identified under drought stress and non-stress conditions for the three traits. Epistatic interactions were also detected for GY which explained a large proportion of phenotypic variance observed in the population. This strategy allowed us to identify QTLs for GY along with rapid development of high-yielding purelines tolerant to blast and drought with considerably reduced efforts. Apart from this, it also allowed us to study the effects of the selection cycle for blast tolerance. The developed lines were screened at IRRI and in the target environment, and drought and blast tolerant lines with high yield were identified.

No. 101154) into O. sativa subsp. japonica cv. Hwaseongbyeo as a recurrent parent. An advanced introgression (backcross) line, HG101, produced from a single plant from BC5F3 families resembled Hwaseongbyeo, but it showed differences from Hwaseongbyeo in several traits, including days to heading and culm length. To detect the introgressions, 450 microsatellite markers of known chromosomal position were used for the parental survey. Of the 450 markers, 51 (11.3%) detected O. grandiglumis segments in HG101. To characterize the effects of alien genes introgressed into HG101, an F(2:3) population (150 families) from the cross Hwaseongbyeo/HG101 was developed and evaluated for 13 agronomic traits. Several lines outperformed Hwaseongbyeo in several traits, including days to heading. Genotypes were determined for 150 F2 plants using simple sequence repeat markers. Qualitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was carried out to determine the relationship between marker genotype and the traits evaluated.

In our ongoing characterization of the defence mechanisms of rice plants against M. oryzae, a terpene synthase gene OsTPS19 was identified as a candidate defence gene. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsTPS19, which is up-regulated by M. oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsTPS19 in rice plants enhanced resistance against M. oryzae, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogen. Metabolic analysis revealed that the production of a monoterpene (S)-limonene was increased and decreased in OsTPS19 overexpression and RNAi lines, respectively, suggesting that OsTPS19 functions as a limonene synthase in planta. This notion was further supported by in vitro enzyme assays with recombinant OsTPS19, in which OsTPS19 had both sesquiterpene activity and monoterpene synthase activity, with limonene as a major product. Furthermore, in a subcellular localization experiment, OsTPS19 was localized in plastids. OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event. We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity. The expression of OsTPS20 was not affected by M. oryzae infection. This indicates functional divergence of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20.

30967012,A nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat receptor pair confers broad-spectrum disease resistance through physical association in rice.,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is the most destructive fungal disease in crops, greatly threatening rice production and food security worldwide. The identification and utilization of broad-spectrum resistance genes are considered to be the most economic and effective method to control the disease. In the past decade, many blast resistance ( R) genes have been identified, which mainly encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor family and confer limited race-specific resistance to the fungal pathogen. Resistance genes conferring broad-spectrum blast resistance are still largely lacking. In this study, we carried out a map-based cloning of the new blast R locus Pizh in variety ZH11. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of 165 kb spanning the Pizh locus was sequenced and identified 9 NLR genes, among which only Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 were expressed. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that Pizh-1 but not Pizh-2 alone could confer blast resistance. Intriguingly, both mutations on Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 by CRISPR-Cas9 abolished the Pizh-mediated resistance. We also observed that Pizh-1-mediated resistance was partially dependent on Pizh-2. Pizh-1 and Pizh-2 form a complex of NLRs through direct interaction. This suggests that Pizh-1 may function as the executor NLR and Pizh-2 as a 'helper' NLR that shares functional redundancy with other NLRs.

26885647,Prediction of Phenotypic Effects of Variants Observed in LOC_Os04g36720 of FRO1 Gene in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"In rice, ferric-chelate reductase-1 (FRO1) (LOC_Os04g36720) gene was present on chromosome number 4 and its beginning and ending coordinates where coding sequence lies are 22182599 and 22186943, respectively. It plays a vital role in metal homeostasis and iron transportation in plants. Based on the alignment results, location of single-nucleotide variants is located in open reading frame and their effects of variants were predicted using SIFT sequence tool. The non-synonymous variants at position 342 and 436 lies in helical and coil parts of the protein, respectively, as predicted by Psi-pred server. PSI-Blast which resulted in significant hits and the most similar protein sequence (Accession ID: NP_001052896) with available sequence features displayed 100 % identity with query cover of 99 %. Results suggest the non-synonymous variant at position 436 (Accession ID: TBGI204002) lies in FAD-binding domain and nsSNV at position 342 (Accession ID: TBGI203998) lies in periphery of NADP. The SNPs were also analyzed for the deleterious effect by PANTHER subPSEC scores and I-mutant score, and it was postulated that SNPs would be hampering on biological as well as molecular function of FRO 1 gene of rice. A cutoff of -3 corresponds to a 50 % probability that a score is deleterious. From this, the probability that a given variant will cause a deleterious effect on protein function is estimated by P <sub>deleterious</sub>, such that a subPSEC score of -4 corresponds to a P <sub>deleterious</sub> of 0.79. Hence, to study the phenotypic consequences of variant TBGI204002, we performed comparative molecular docking studies of native modeled protein and protein with induced mutation as receptors and FAD as ligand to be utilized for binding. The docking process was performed by AutoDock 4.2 software with Lamarckian Genetic algorithm as computational algorithm. Results suggest binding energies are higher in case of mutation-induced protein which suggests presence of variant TBGI204002 enhances binding of FAD ligand at FAD-binding domain site. In case of TBGI203998, similar comparative docking procedure was performed with FAD as binding ligand, which suggests presence of variant does not impact FAD binding at the domain site.

In this study, OsUBC26, a rice ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, was characterized in the defence against Magnaporthe oryzae. The expression of OsUBC26 was induced by M. oryzae inoculation and methyl jasmonate treatment. Both RNA interference lines and CRISPR/Cas9 null mutants of OsUBC26 reduced rice resistance to M. oryzae. WRKY45 was down-regulated in OsUBC26 null mutants. In vitro E2 activity assay indicated that OsUBC26 is an active ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Yeast two-hybrid assays using OsUBC26 as bait identified the RING-type E3 ligase UCIP2 as an interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the interaction between OsUBC26 and UCIP2. The CRISPR/Cas9 mutants of UCIP2 also showed compromised resistance to M. oryzae. Yeast two-hybrid screening using UCIP2 as bait revealed that APIP6 is a binding partner of UCIP2. Moreover, OsUBC26 working with APIP6 ubiquitinateds AvrPiz-t, an avirulence effector of M. oryzae, and OsUBC26 null mutation impaired the proteasome degradation of AvrPiz-t in rice cells.

34570416,Tangeretin inhibits fungal ferroptosis to suppress rice blast.,"Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary metabolites that function as signaling molecules, allopathic compounds, phytoalexins, detoxifying agents and antimicrobial defensive compounds in plants. Blast caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a serious disease affecting rice cultivation. In this study, we revealed that a natural flavonoid, tangeretin, substantially delays the formation of M. oryzae appressoria and blocks the development of blast lesions on rice plants. Our data suggest that tangeretin has antioxidant activity that interferes with conidial cell death/ferroptosis, which is critical for M. oryzae pathogenicity. Tangeretin showed a ferroptosis inhibition efficacy comparable to the well-established liproxstatin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of the NADPH oxidases NOX1 or NOX2 significantly decreased sensitivity toward tangeretin treatment, suggesting Nox-mediated lipid peroxidation as a possible target for tangeretin in regulating redox signaling and ferroptosis in M. oryzae.

Understanding the cellular localization of Pi54 protein is an essential step towards deciphering its place of interaction with the cognate Avr-gene. In this study, we investigated the sub-cellular localization of Pi54 with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a molecular tag through transient and stable expression in onion epidermal cells (Allium cepa) and susceptible japonica cultivar rice Taipei 309 (TP309), respectively. Confocal microscopy based observations of the onion epidermal cells revealed nucleus and cytoplasm specific GFP signals. In the stable transformed rice plants, GFP signal was recorded in the stomata, upper epidermal cells, mesophyll cells, vascular bundle, and walls of bundle sheath and bulliform cells of leaf tissues. These observations were further confirmed by Immunocytochemical studies. Using GFP specific antibodies, it was found that there was sufficient aggregation of GFP::Pi54protein in the cytoplasm of the leaf mesophyll cells and periphery of the epidermal cells. Interestingly, the transgenic lines developed in this study could show a moderate level of resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agents of the rice bacterial blight and sheath blight diseases, respectively.

15985420,[The research progress on molecular genetics of pathogenicity of rice blast fungus.].,"Rice blast disease, caused by heterothallic ascomycete Magnaporthe grisea, is one of the most serious fungal diseases of rice throughout the world. The disease attacks rice plants throughout the season and causes severe yield losses. The pathogenesis of M. grisea is due to a complex process that spans the entire life cycle of the pathogen. The process including germination of conidia, formation of appressoria, differentiation of penetration pegs and proliferation of infectious hyphae is controlled by many genes. The interaction between M. grisea and rice is based on the gene-for-gene hypothesis and the defense responses are often activated by the action of the pathogen avirulence (Avr) gene and the host resistance (R) gene. The studies on molecular biology and genetic mechanism of pathogenicity of M. grisea has occupied pathologists and mycologists for several decades.

32367535,Ferroptosis contributes to developmental cell death in rice blast.,"Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death process, was found to occur in Magnaporthe oryzae, and plays a key role in infection-related development therein. Ferroptosis in the rice-blast fungus was confirmed based on five basic criteria. We confirmed the dependence of ferroptosis on ferric ions, and optimized ratio-fluorescence imaging of C11-BODIPY<sup>581/591</sup> as a precise sensor for lipid peroxides that mediate ferroptosis in M. oryzae. We uncovered an important regulatory function for reduced glutathione and NADPH oxidases in modulating the superoxide moieties required for ferroptotic cell death. We found ferroptosis to be necessary for the developmental cell death of conidia during appressorium maturation in rice blast. Such ferroptotic cell death initiated first in the terminal cell and progressed sequentially to the entire conidium. Iron chelation or chemical inhibition of ferroptosis caused conidial cells to remain viable, and led to strong defects in host invasion by M. oryzae. Ferroptosis induction exclusively in the host severely constrained the invasive growth of M. oryzae. We found inter-reliant and independent roles for ferroptosis and autophagy in controlling such precise cell death in M. oryzae during pathogenic differentiation.

The objective of our study was to assess syntenic relationships of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for disease resistance in cereals by using a model system in which rice and barley were used as the hosts and the blast fungus Pyricularia grisea Sacc. as the pathogen. In total, 12 QTL against three isolates were identified in rice; two had effects on all three isolates, and the other 10 had effects on only one or two of the three isolates. Twelve QTL for blast resistance were identified in barley; one had effect on all three isolates, and the other 11 had effects on only one or two of the three isolates. The observed isolate specificity led to a hypothesis about the durability of quantitative resistance commonly observed in many plant host-pathogen systems. Four pairs of the QTL showed corresponding map positions between rice and barley, two of the four QTL pairs had complete conserved isolate specificity, and another two QTL pairs had partial conserved isolate specificity.

We performed a genomewide comparison of the major class of resistant gene family, the nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) gene family, between 93-11 (indica) and Nipponbare (japonica) with a focus on their pseudogene members. We found great differences in either constitution or distribution of pseudogenes between the two genomes. According to this comparison, we designed the PCR-based molecular markers specific to the Nipponbare NBS-LRR pseudogene alleles and used them as cosegregation markers for blast susceptibility in a segregation population from a cross between a rice blast-resistant indica variety and a susceptible japonica variety. Through this approach, we identified a new blast resistance gene, Pid3, in the indica variety, Digu. The allelic Pid3 loci in most of the tested japonica varieties were identified as pseudogenes due to a nonsense mutation at the nucleotide position 2208 starting from the translation initiation site. However, this mutation was not found in any of the tested indica varieties, African cultivated rice varieties, or AA genome-containing wild rice species.

29931642,"Effects of exogenous salicylic acid and pH on pathogenicity of biotrophy-associated secreted protein 1 (BAS1)-overexpressing strain, Magnaporthe oryzae.","Abiotic stress can influence the interactions between a pathogen and its host. In this paper, we analyzed the effects of salicylic acid (SA) and pH on the morphological development and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae, the pathogen that causes rice (Oryza sativa) blast. A strain of rice blast that overexpresses biotrophy-associated secreted protein 1 (BAS1) and a wild-type (WT) strain were pretreated with different levels of pH and different concentrations of SA to analyze M. oryzae colony growth, sporulation, spore germination, dry weight of hypha, and appressorium formation. Disease incidence and the expression of defense-related genes in infected rice were analyzed after pretreatment with pH 5.00 or pH 8.00 and 200 μM SA. The results showed that both SA and pH had some influence on morphological development, including sporulation and appressorium formation of the BAS1-overexpression strain. In the 200 μM SA pretreatment, there was a lower incidence of disease and higher expression levels of the rice defense-related genes PR1a, PAL, HSP90, and PR5 on leaves inoculated with the BAS1-overexpession strain compared with the WT strain, whereas, LOX2 appeared to be downregulated in the BAS1-overexpession strain compared with the WT. In both pH treatments, disease incidence and expression of HSP90 were higher and the expression of PR1a and PR10a and LOX2 and PAL was lower in leaves inoculated with the BAS1-overexpression strain compared with leaves inoculated with the WT strain. We conclude that SA and pH affect morphological development of the BAS1-overexpression blast strain, but that these factors have little influence on the pathogenicity of the strain, indicating that BAS1-overexpression may have enhanced the tolerance of this rice blast strain to abiotic stressors. This work suggests new molecular mechanisms that exogenous SA and pH affect the interactions between M. oryzae and rice.",abiotic stress influence interaction pathogen host paper analyzed effect salicylic acid sa ph morphological development pathogenicity magnaporthe oryzae pathogen cause rice oryza sativa blast strain rice blast overexpresses biotrophyassociated secreted protein ba wildtype wt strain pretreated different level ph different concentration sa analyze oryzae colony growth sporulation spore germination dry weight hypha appressorium formation disease incidence expression defenserelated gene infected rice analyzed pretreatment ph ph μm sa result showed sa ph influence morphological development including sporulation appressorium formation basoverexpression strain μm sa pretreatment lower incidence disease higher expression level rice defenserelated gene pra pal hsp pr leaf inoculated basoverexpession strain compared wt strain whereas lox appeared downregulated basoverexpession strain compared wt ph treatment disease incidence expression hsp higher expression pra pra lox pal lower leaf inoculated basoverexpression strain compared leaf inoculated wt strain conclude sa ph affect morphological development basoverexpression blast strain factor little influence pathogenicity strain indicating basoverexpression may enhanced tolerance rice blast strain abiotic stressor work suggests new molecular mechanism exogenous sa ph affect interaction oryzae rice,4,"{'Disease': ['oryzae colony growth sporulation spore germination dry weight hypha appressorium formation disease incidence expression', 'ph treatment disease incidence expression hsp higher expression'], 'Treatment': ['ph treatment disease incidence expression hsp higher expression'], 'Symptom': ['effect salicylic acid sa ph morphological development pathogenicity']}",6

15159626,Transgenic rice plants expressing the antifungal AFP protein from Aspergillus giganteus show enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.,"The Aspergillus giganteus antifungal protein (AFP), encoded by the afp gene, has been reported to possess in vitro antifungal activity against various economically important fungal pathogens, including the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. In this study, transgenic rice ( Oryza sativa ) constitutively expressing the afp gene was generated by Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. Two different DNA constructs containing either the afp cDNA sequence from Aspergillus or a chemically synthesized codon-optimized afp gene were introduced into rice plants. In both cases, the DNA region encoding the signal sequence from the tobacco AP24 gene was N-terminally fused to the coding sequence of the mature AFP protein. Transgenic rice plants showed stable integration and inheritance of the transgene. No effect on plant morphology was observed in the afp -expressing rice lines. The inhibitory activity of protein extracts prepared from leaves of afp plants on the in vitro growth of M. grisea indicated that the AFP protein produced by the trangenic rice plants was biologically active. Several of the T(2) homozygous afp lines were challenged with M. grisea in a detached leaf infection assay. Transformants exhibited resistance to rice blast at various levels.

The prevalence of different biotypes/strains has necessitated assembling of numerous resistance genes/QTLs into elite genotypes to confer a broader scale of resistance. The current study reports successful pyramiding of genes/QTLs that confer tolerance/resistance to submergence (Sub1), salinity (Saltol), blast (Pi2, Pi9) and gall midge (Gm1, Gm4) to supplement the four bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa 4, xa5, xa13, Xa21) present in Improved Tapaswini, an elite cultivar.

26679839,Endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound MoSec62 is involved in the suppression of rice immunity and is essential for the pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) constitutes the first line of plant inducible immunity. As an important step of plant colonization, phytopathogens have to suppress PTI, and secreted effectors are therefore co-evolved and deployed. In this study, we characterized the function of MoSec62 of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of the destructive rice blast. MoSec62 encodes a homologue of Sec62p, a yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane transporter for precursors of secretory proteins. We showed that a T-DNA insertion into the promoter region of MoSec62, causing a disturbance to the up-regulation of MoSec62 expression during blast invasion, resulted in a complete loss of blast virulence of the mutant, M1575. Both 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining of the infected rice leaves and expression analysis revealed that the infectious attempt by the mutant led to strong defence responses of rice. Consistently, in transcriptomic analysis of rice leaves subject to blast inoculation, a battery of defence responses was found to be induced exclusively on M1575 challenge. For further exploration, we tested the pathogenicity on a highly susceptible rice variety and detected the accumulation of Slp1, a known PTI suppressor. Both results suggested that the mutant most likely failed to overcome rice PTI. In addition, we showed that MoSec62 was able to rescue the thermosensitivity of a yeast Δsec62, and the MoSec62-GFP fusion was co-localized to the ER membrane, both suggesting the conservation of Sec62 homologues. In conclusion, our data indicate that MoSec62, probably as an ER membrane transporter, plays an essential role in antagonizing rice defence at the early stages of blast invasion.",pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamptriggered immunity pti constitutes first line plant inducible immunity important step plant colonization phytopathogens suppress pti secreted effector therefore coevolved deployed study characterized function mosec magnaporthe oryzae causal agent destructive rice blast mosec encodes homologue secp yeast endoplasmic reticulum er membrane transporter precursor secretory protein showed tdna insertion promoter region mosec causing disturbance upregulation mosec expression blast invasion resulted complete loss blast virulence mutant diaminobenzidine dab staining infected rice leaf expression analysis revealed infectious attempt mutant led strong defence response rice consistently transcriptomic analysis rice leaf subject blast inoculation battery defence response found induced exclusively challenge exploration tested pathogenicity highly susceptible rice variety detected accumulation slp known pti suppressor result suggested mutant likely failed overcome rice pti addition showed mosec able rescue thermosensitivity yeast δsec mosecgfp fusion colocalized er membrane suggesting conservation sec homologues conclusion data indicate mosec probably er membrane transporter play essential role antagonizing rice defence early stage blast invasion,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['suppress pti secreted effector']}",7

18074138,The rice pathogen-related protein 10 (JIOsPR10) is induced by abiotic and biotic stresses and exhibits ribonuclease activity.,"We previously reported that rice blast fungus or jasmonic acid induced the expression of rice pathogenesis-related class 10 (JIOsPR10) proteins (Kim et al. 2003, 2004). However, no further studies have been carried out to examine the expression, localization, and enzymatic activity of this protein in either developmental tissues or in tissues under abiotic stress conditions. In this study, rice JIOsPR10 was examined by Western blot analysis, immunolocalization, and biochemical assays. Western blots revealed that the JIOsPR10 protein was expressed in developmental tissues, including in flower and root. The protein was also expressed under abiotic stresses, such as occurs during senescence and wounding. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we determined that expression of JIOsPR10 was localized to the palea of flower, in the exodermis, and inner part of the endodermis of the root. In senescencing tissues of leaf and coleoptiles, its expression was localized in vascular bundles. The RNase activity using JIOsPR10 recombinant protein was determined and abolished after treatment with DTT in a native in-gel assay. To test this, we created JIOsPR10 mutant proteins containing serine substitutions of amino acids C81S, C83S, or both and examined their RNase activities. The activity of the C83S mutant was decreased in the agarose gel assay compared to the wild type. Taken together, we hypothesize that the JIOsPR10 protein possesses RNase activity that is sensitive to DTT, suggesting the importance of the disulfide bonding between cysteine residues and that it might play a role in constitutive self-defense mechanisms in plants against biotic and abiotic stresses.",previously reported rice blast fungus jasmonic acid induced expression rice pathogenesisrelated class jiospr protein kim et al however study carried examine expression localization enzymatic activity protein either developmental tissue tissue abiotic stress condition study rice jiospr examined western blot analysis immunolocalization biochemical assay western blot revealed jiospr protein expressed developmental tissue including flower root protein also expressed abiotic stress occurs senescence wounding using immunohistochemical technique determined expression jiospr localized palea flower exodermis inner part endodermis root senescencing tissue leaf coleoptiles expression localized vascular bundle rnase activity using jiospr recombinant protein determined abolished treatment dtt native ingel assay test created jiospr mutant protein containing serine substitution amino acid c c examined rnase activity activity c mutant decreased agarose gel assay compared wild type taken together hypothesize jiospr protein possesses rnase activity sensitive dtt suggesting importance disulfide bonding cysteine residue might play role constitutive selfdefense mechanism plant biotic abiotic stress,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus jasmonic acid'], 'Treatment': ['abolished treatment dtt native ingel assay test'], 'Symptom': []}",7

24633351,Transposon-based high sequence diversity in Avr-Pita alleles increases the potential for pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae populations.,"Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast that is one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. Highly variable nature of this fungus has evolved itself against major resistance genes in newly released rice varieties. Understanding the population structure of this fungus is essential for proper utilization of the rice blast resistance genes in rice crop plants. In the present study, we analyzed 133 isolates of M. oryzae from ten countries to find the allelic variation of Avr-Pita gene that is triggering Pita-mediated resistance in rice plant. The diversity analysis of these alleles showed higher level of nucleotide variation in the coding regions than the noncoding regions. Evolutionary analysis of these alleles indicates that Avr-Pita gene is under purifying selection to favor its major alleles in 133 isolates analyzed in this study. We hypothesize that the selection of favorable Avr-Pita allele in these isolates may occur through a genetic mechanism known as recurrent selective sweeps. A total of 22 functional Avr-Pita protein variants were identified in this study. Insertion of Pot3 transposable element into the promoter of Avr-Pita gene was identified in virulent isolates and was suggested that mobility of repeat elements in avirulence genes of M. oryzae seems to help in emergence of new virulent types of the pathogen.

Here, we report this plant-specific novel <i>DUF668</i> gene family containing 12 <i>OsDUF668</i> genes in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and 91 <i>DUF668</i>s for the other seven plant species. In our study, <i>DUF668</i> genes were present in both dicot and monocot plants, indicating that <i>DUF668</i> is a conserved gene family that originated by predating the dicot-monocot divergence. Based on the gene structure and motif composition, the <i>DUF668</i> family consists of two distinct clades, I and II in the phylogenetic tree. Remarkably, <i>OsDUF668</i> genes clustered on the chromosomes merely show close phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that gene duplications or collinearity seldom happened. <i>Cis</i>-elements prediction display that over 80% of <i>DUF668s</i> contain phytohormone and light responsiveness factors. Further comprehensive experimental analyses of the <i>OsDUF668</i> family are implemented in 22 different tissues, five hormone treatments, seven environmental factor stresses, and two pathogen-defense related stresses. The <i>OsDUF668</i> genes express ubiquitously in analyzed rice tissues, and seven genes show tissue-specific high expression profiles.

11332734,Identification of defense-related rice genes by suppression subtractive hybridization and differential screening.,"Identification of host genes involved in defense responses is one of most critical steps leading to the elucidation of disease resistance mechanisms in plants. In this study, two different cloning strategies were employed to identify defense-related genes from a tropical japonica rice cultivar (Oryza sativa cv. Drew). With the use of bacterial colony arrays, differential screening of a blast fungus (Pyricularia grisea)-induced rice cDNA library led to the isolation of 22 distinct rice genes that are expressed differentially in response to blast infection. Sequence analysis indicates that most of them are full-length cDNAs encoding pathogenesis-related proteins or other relatively abundant proteins. In combination with treatments of cycloheximide plus jasmonic acid (JA) or benzothiadiazole (BTH) in rice seedlings, the polymerase chain reaction-based suppression subtractive hybridization also was conducted to search for immediate early (IE) defense-related genes whose transcription is independent of de novo protein synthesis. The initial screening of only 768 subtracted clones resulted in the identification of 34 distinct IE genes that are induced by JA, BTH, and/or blast infection. Database searches revealed that these IE genes encode putative mitogen-activated protein kinase, diacylglycerol kinase, zinc finger protein, RelA-SpoT protein, ankyrin-containing protein, ABC transporter, beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, and other potential defense-signaling components.

31729398,Deciphering signalling network in broad spectrum Near Isogenic Lines of rice resistant to Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Disease resistance (R) genes like Pi9, Pita, Pi21, Pi54 are playing important role for broad spectrum blast resistance in rice. Development of near isogenic lines (NILs) using these type of broad spectrum genes and understanding their signalling networks is essential to cope up with highly evolving Magnaporthe oryzae strains for longer duration. Here, transcriptional-level changes were studied in three near-isogenic lines (PB1 + Pi1, PB1 + Pi9 and PB1 + Pi54) of rice resistant to blast infection, to find the loci that are unique to resistant lines developed in the background of Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1). The pathway analysis of loci, unique to resistant NILs compared to susceptible control revealed that plant secondary metabolite synthesis was the common mechanism among all NILs to counter against M. oryzae infection. Comparative transcriptome analysis helped to find out common clusters of co-expressed significant differentially expressed loci (SDEL) in both PB1 + Pi9 and PB1 + Pi54 NILs. SDELs from these clusters were involved in the synthesis and degradation of starch; synthesis and elongation of fatty acids; hydrolysis of phospholipids; synthesis of phenylpropanoid; and metabolism of ethylene and jasmonic acid. Through detailed analysis of loci specific to each resistant NIL, we identified a network of signalling pathways mediated by each blast resistance gene. The study also offers insights into transcriptomic dynamics, points to a set of important candidate genes that serve as module to regulate the changes in resistant NILs.

23135860,Molecular strategies to improve rice disease resistance.,"Rice diseases such as blast (Magnaporthe oryzae), sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae) are a major obstacle to achieving optimal yields. To complement conventional breeding method, molecular and transgenic method represents an increasingly important approach for genetic improvement of disease resistance and reduction of pesticide usage. During the past two decades, a wide variety of genes and mechanisms involved in rice defense response have been identified and elucidated. These include components of pathogen recognition, signal transduction, downstream defense-related proteins, and crosstalk among different signaling pathways. In addition, various molecular strategies including use of specialized promoters, modification of target protein structures have been studied and proposed to improve the effectiveness of transgenes. While genetically improving rice for enhanced disease resistance, it is important to consider potential effects of the transgene on rice yield, tolerance to abiotic stresses, and defense against other pathogens.",rice disease blast magnaporthe oryzae sheath blight rhizoctonia solani bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae major obstacle achieving optimal yield complement conventional breeding method molecular transgenic method represents increasingly important approach genetic improvement disease resistance reduction pesticide usage past two decade wide variety gene mechanism involved rice defense response identified elucidated include component pathogen recognition signal transduction downstream defenserelated protein crosstalk among different signaling pathway addition various molecular strategy including use specialized promoter modification target protein structure studied proposed improve effectiveness transgene genetically improving rice enhanced disease resistance important consider potential effect transgene rice yield tolerance abiotic stress defense pathogen,8,"{'Disease': ['rice disease blast', 'increasingly important approach genetic improvement disease resistance reduction pesticide usage', 'rice enhanced disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['proposed improve effectiveness transgene']}",7
18808453,Refunctionalization of the ancient rice blast disease resistance gene Pit by the recruitment of a retrotransposon as a promoter.,"The plant genome contains a large number of disease resistance (R) genes that have evolved through diverse mechanisms. Here, we report that a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon contributed to the evolution of the rice blast resistance gene Pit. Pit confers race-specific resistance against the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and is a member of the nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) family of R genes. Compared with the non-functional allele Pit(Npb), the functional allele Pit(K59) contains four amino acid substitutions, and has the LTR retrotransposon Renovator inserted upstream. Pathogenesis assays using chimeric constructs carrying the various regions of Pit(K59) and Pit(Npb) suggest that amino acid substitutions might have a potential effect in Pit resistance; more importantly, the upregulated promoter activity conferred by the Renovator sequence is essential for Pit function. Our data suggest that transposon-mediated transcriptional activation may play an important role in the refunctionalization of additional 'sleeping' R genes in the plant genome.",plant genome contains large number disease resistance r gene evolved diverse mechanism report long terminal repeat ltr retrotransposon contributed evolution rice blast resistance gene pit pit confers racespecific resistance fungal pathogen magnaporthe grisea member nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat nbslrr family r gene compared nonfunctional allele pitnpb functional allele pitk contains four amino acid substitution ltr retrotransposon renovator inserted upstream pathogenesis assay using chimeric construct carrying various region pitk pitnpb suggest amino acid substitution might potential effect pit resistance importantly upregulated promoter activity conferred renovator sequence essential pit function data suggest transposonmediated transcriptional activation may play important role refunctionalization additional sleeping r gene plant genome,4,"{'Disease': ['large number disease resistance r gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

However, the mechanism underlying the balance between immunity and flowering remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that the E3 ligase ideal plant architecture 1 interactor 1 (IPI1) controls rice immunity and flowering via two different pathways, one dependent on and another independent of its E3 ligase activity. We found that IPI1, a RING-finger E3 ligase, interacts with another E3 ligase, AvrPiz-t-interacting protein 6 (APIP6), and protects APIP6 from degradation by preventing APIP6's self-ubiquitination. Stabilization of APIP6 by IPI1 requires no IPI1 E3 ligase activity and leads to degradation of APIP6 substrates via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Meanwhile, IPI1 directly ubiquitinates OsELF3-1 and OsELF3-2, two homologs of EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), targeting them for degradation via the 26S proteasome. IPI1 knockout plants display early flowering but compromised resistance to rice blast. Thus, IPI1 balances rice immunity and flowering via both E3 ligase-dependent and -independent pathways.",immunity flowering energyconsuming process however mechanism underlying balance immunity flowering remains elucidated report e ligase ideal plant architecture interactor ipi control rice immunity flowering via two different pathway one dependent another independent e ligase activity found ipi ringfinger e ligase interacts another e ligase avrpiztinteracting protein apip protects apip degradation preventing apips selfubiquitination stabilization apip ipi requires ipi e ligase activity lead degradation apip substrate via ubiquitinproteasome system ups meanwhile ipi directly ubiquitinates oself oself two homologs early flowering elf targeting degradation via proteasome ipi knockout plant display early flowering compromised resistance rice blast thus ipi balance rice immunity flowering via e ligasedependent independent pathway,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

Blast severity was reduced in the leaves of +Glu plants. On the infected leaves of +Glu plants, the values for internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were lower while the values for net carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance as well as for the concentrations of Chl a, Chl b and carotenoids were higher in comparison to infected leaves of -Glu plants. The functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus was preserved in the infected leaves of +Glu plants. The activities of CAT, GPX, GR, POX and SOD increased in the infected leaves of both -Glu and +Glu plants compared to their non-inoculated counterparts, but their activities were lower for +Glu plants. The lower activity of these antioxidative enzymes was triggered by the reduced hydrogen peroxide concentration in the infected leaves of +Glu plants resulting in lower MDA concentration. It can be concluded that photosynthesis was less impaired in infected plants supplied with glutamate due to the lower biochemical constraints for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Moreover, there was a need for lower activity of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes in infected leaves of plants supplied with glutamate due to the lower oxidative stress imposed by P. oryzae infection.",considering importance blast caused pyricularia oryzae decrease rice yield worldwide study aimed assess photosynthetic performance leaf gas exchange chlorophyll chl fluorescence parameter well photosynthetic pigment concentration activity antioxidant enzyme ascorbate peroxidase catalase cat peroxidase pox superoxide dismutase sod glutathione peroxidase gpx glutathione reductase gr glutathionestransferase concentration hydrogen peroxide hsubsub osubsub malondialdehyde mda leaf rice plant nonsupplied glu supplied glu glutamate glu noninfected infected p oryzae blast severity reduced leaf glu plant infected leaf glu plant value internal cosubsub concentration lower value net carbon assimilation rate stomatal conductance well concentration chl chl b carotenoid higher comparison infected leaf glu plant functionality photosynthetic apparatus preserved infected leaf glu plant activity cat gpx gr pox sod increased infected leaf glu glu plant compared noninoculated counterpart activity lower glu plant lower activity antioxidative enzyme triggered reduced hydrogen peroxide concentration infected leaf glu plant resulting lower mda concentration concluded photosynthesis less impaired infected plant supplied glutamate due lower biochemical constraint cosubsub fixation moreover need lower activity reactive oxygen specie scavenging enzyme infected leaf plant supplied glutamate due lower oxidative stress imposed p oryzae infection,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",11
36321201,"SH3P2, an SH3 domain-containing protein that interacts with both Pib and AvrPib, suppresses effector-triggered, Pib-mediated immunity in rice.","Plants usually keep resistance (R) proteins in a static state under normal conditions to avoid autoimmunity and save energy for growth, but R proteins can be rapidly activated upon perceiving pathogen invasion. Pib, the first cloned blast disease R gene in rice, encoding a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein, mediates resistance to the blast fungal (Magnaporthe oryzae) isolates carrying the avirulence gene AvrPib. However, the molecular mechanisms about how Pib recognizes AvrPib and how it is inactivated and activated remain largely unclear. In this study, through map-based cloning and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we proved that Pib contributes to the blast disease resistance of rice cultivar Yunyin (YY). Furthermore, an SH3 domain-containing protein, SH3P2, was found to associate with Pib mainly at clathrin-coated vesicles in rice cells, via direct binding with the coiled-coil (CC) domain of Pib. Interestingly, overexpression of SH3P2 in YY compromised Pib-mediated resistance to M. oryzae isolates carrying AvrPib and Pib-AvrPib recognition-induced cell death. SH3P2 competitively inhibits the self-association of the Pib CC domain in vitro, suggesting that binding of SH3P2 with Pib undermines its homodimerization. Moreover, SH3P2 can also interact with AvrPib and displays higher affinity to AvrPib than to Pib, which leads to dissociation of SH3P2 from Pib in the presence of AvrPib. Taken together, our results suggest that SH3P2 functions as a ""protector"" to keep Pib in a static state by direct interaction during normal growth but could be triggered off by the invasion of AvrPib-carrying M. oryzae isolates.

18321185,"Identification of a new locus, Ptr(t), required for rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta-mediated resistance.","Resistance to the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is proposed to be initiated by physical binding of a putative cytoplasmic receptor encoded by a nucleotide binding site-type resistance gene, Pi-ta, to the processed elicitor encoded by the corresponding avirulence gene AVR-Pita. Here, we report the identification of a new locus, Ptr(t), that is required for Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition. A Pi-ta-expressing susceptible mutant was identified using a genetic screen. Putative mutations at Ptr(t) do not alter recognition specificity to another resistance gene, Pi-k(s), in the Pi-ta homozygote, indicating that Ptr(t) is more likely specific to Pi-ta-mediated signal recognition. Genetic crosses of Pi-ta Ptr(t) and Pi-ta ptr(t) homozygotes suggest that Ptr(t) segregates as a single dominant nuclear gene. A ratio of 1:1 (resistant/susceptible) of a population of BC1 of Pi-ta Ptr(t) with pi-ta ptr(t) homozygotes indicates that Pi-ta and Ptr(t) are linked and cosegregate. Genotyping of mutants of pi-ta ptr(t) and Pi-ta Ptr(t) homozygotes using ten simple sequence repeat markers at the Pi-ta region determined that Pi-ta and Ptr(t) are located within a 9-megabase region and are of indica origin.

39106768,Variation in phytotoxicity of rice seedlings caused by differential accumulation of azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin in leaves.,"The effectiveness of pyraclostrobin (Pyr) and azoxystrobin (Azo) with highly targeting the rice blast is noteworthy, but they have varied toxic levels towards non-target aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the toxic selectivity and mechanism of non-target plants, specifically rice, remain uncertain. In this study, we investigated the potential phytotoxic effects of Pyr and Azo on rice seedlings, including plant morphology, plant growth, physiological and biochemical changes. The findings revealed that both Pyr and Azo caused toxic effects on rice, resulting in symptoms of chlorosis and inhibited growth. The toxicity of Azo was found to be more severe when applied at the recommended field dose. Disruption of oxidative stress could significantly impact the demonstrated levels of REC, leading to a decrease in photosynthetic pigments and potentially culminating in cell death. Furthermore, the toxic effect of Azo had a greater impact on rice leaves compared to Pyr at treatments of 400, 800, 1600, and 4000 mg/L. However, the in vitro cytotoxicity of Azo on rice leaves was lower than that of Pyr. Therefore, it can be inferred that the mechanism of phytotoxicity of Azo is directly linked to the increased accumulation of the compound on the leaf tips and edges. Additionally, the positive effects observed on plant morphology and growth parameters suggest that the mixed application of plant growth regulators (sodium nitrophenolate aqueous solution of 14 mg/L and diethyl aminoethyl hexanoat of 50 mg/L) can be a promising approach to mitigate the rice phytotoxicity of Azo at 400 and 800 mg/L.",effectiveness pyraclostrobin pyr azoxystrobin azo highly targeting rice blast noteworthy varied toxic level towards nontarget aquatic organism nevertheless toxic selectivity mechanism nontarget plant specifically rice remain uncertain study investigated potential phytotoxic effect pyr azo rice seedling including plant morphology plant growth physiological biochemical change finding revealed pyr azo caused toxic effect rice resulting symptom chlorosis inhibited growth toxicity azo found severe applied recommended field dose disruption oxidative stress could significantly impact demonstrated level rec leading decrease photosynthetic pigment potentially culminating cell death furthermore toxic effect azo greater impact rice leaf compared pyr treatment mgl however vitro cytotoxicity azo rice leaf lower pyr therefore inferred mechanism phytotoxicity azo directly linked increased accumulation compound leaf tip edge additionally positive effect observed plant morphology growth parameter suggest mixed application plant growth regulator sodium nitrophenolate aqueous solution mgl diethyl aminoethyl hexanoat mgl promising approach mitigate rice phytotoxicity azo mgl,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['pyr treatment mgl'], 'Symptom': ['potential phytotoxic effect pyr azo rice seedling', 'toxic effect rice', 'symptom chlorosis inhibited growth toxicity azo', 'cell death furthermore toxic effect azo greater impact rice leaf', 'additionally positive effect observed plant morphology growth parameter']}",4

Previous studies have demonstrated that the NLR gene pair <i>Pik-H4</i> confers resistance to rice blast disease by interacting with the transcription factor OsBIHD1, consequently leading to the upregulation of hormone pathways. In the present study, we identified an RNA recognition motif (RRM) protein, OsRRM2, which interacted with Pik<sub>1</sub>-H4 and Pik<sub>2</sub>-H4 in vesicles and chloroplasts. OsRRM2 exhibited a modest influence on <i>Pik-H4</i>-mediated rice blast resistance by upregulating resistance genes and genes associated with chloroplast immunity. Moreover, the RNA-binding sequence of OsRRM2 was elucidated using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. Transcriptome analysis further indicated that OsRRM2 promoted RNA editing of the chloroplastic gene <i>ndhB</i>.

BPH female adults performed concentration-dependent behavioural responses to (S)-limonene showing preference behaviour at low concentrations and avoidance behaviour at high concentrations. Overexpression lines of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20, which emitted higher amounts of the monoterpene (S)-limonene, decreased the hatching rate of BPH eggs, reduced the lesion length of sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani and bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae. While knockout lines of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20, which emitted lower amounts of (S)-limonene, were more susceptible to these pathogens. Overexpression of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 in rice plants had adverse effects on the incidence of BPH, rice blast, and sheath blight in the field and had no significant impacts on rice yield traits.

BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1 (BSR1), a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily-VII protein, contributes to chitin-triggered immune responses. It is valuable for agriculture because its overexpression confers strong disease resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens. However, it remains unclear how overexpressed BSR1 reinforces plant immunity. Here we analyzed immune responses using rice suspension-cultured cells and sliced leaf blades overexpressing BSR1. BSR1 overexpression enhances MAMP-triggered production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and transcriptional activation of the defense-related gene in cultured cells and leaf strips. Furthermore, the co-cultivation of leaves with conidia of the blast fungus revealed that BSR1 overexpression allowed host plants to produce detectable oxidative bursts against compatible pathogens. BSR1 was also involved in the immune responses triggered by peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide.

Here we report functional characterization of a rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY89. RNA gel blot analysis indicated that OsWRKY89 was strongly induced by treatments of methyl jasmonate and UV-B radiation. The transient expression analysis of the OsWRKY89-eGFP reporter in onion epidermal cells revealed that OsWRKY89 was targeted to nuclei. Transcriptional activity assays of OsWRKY89 and its mutants fused with a GAL4 DNA binding domain indicated that the 67 C-terminal amino acids were required for the transcriptional activation and that the leucine zipper region at the N-terminus enhanced its transcriptional activity. Overexpression of OsWRKY89 led to growth retardation at the early stage and reduction of internode length. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an increase in wax deposition on leaf surfaces of the OsWRKY89 overexpression lines and a decrease in wax loading in the RNAi-mediated OsWRKY89 suppression lines. Moreover, extractable and cell-wall-bound phenolic compounds were decreased in the overexpressor lines, but its SA levels were increased. Lignin staining showed an increase in lignification in culms of the overexpressor lines.

In the present study, we cloned and identified two rice long-chain base kinase (LCBK) genes (OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2), which are involved in biosynthesis of LCBPs, and performed functional analysis in transgenic tobacco. Expression of OsLCBK1 and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsLCBK1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv. tabacci, the causal agent of wildfire disease, and tobacco mosaic virus. Expression levels of some defense-related genes were constitutively up-regulated and further induced after pathogen infection in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants. Treatment with fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an effective inducer of PCD in plants, resulted in reduced level of cell death in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants, as indicated by cell death staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes. These data suggest that rice LCBKs, probably through regulation of endogenous LCBP level, play important roles in disease resistance response and PCD in plants.",sphingolipid metabolite longchain base phosphate lcbps shown play important role plant however little known function plant disease resistance programmed cell death pcd present study cloned identified two rice longchain base kinase lcbk gene oslcbk oslcbk involved biosynthesis lcbps performed functional analysis transgenic tobacco expression oslcbk oslcbk induced rice seedling treatment defense signaling molecule infection magnaporthe grisea causal agent blast disease transgenic tobacco plant overexpressing oslcbk generated disease resistance assay indicate oslcbkoverexpressing plant showed enhanced disease resistance pseudmonas syringae pv tabacci causal agent wildfire disease tobacco mosaic virus expression level defenserelated gene constitutively upregulated induced pathogen infection oslcbkoverexpressing plant treatment fungal toxin fumonisin b effective inducer pcd plant resulted reduced level cell death oslcbkoverexpressing plant indicated cell death staining leakage electrolyte expression hypersensitive response indicator gene data suggest rice lcbks probably regulation endogenous lcbp level play important role disease resistance response pcd plant,4,"{'Disease': ['little known function plant disease resistance', 'generated disease resistance assay', 'enhanced disease resistance pseudmonas syringae pv tabacci causal agent wildfire disease tobacco mosaic virus expression level defenserelated gene', 'important role disease resistance response pcd plant'], 'Treatment': ['treatment defense', 'plant treatment fungal toxin'], 'Symptom': []}",7
23139845,Simultaneous RNA-seq analysis of a mixed transcriptome of rice and blast fungus interaction.,"A filamentous fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a causal agent of rice blast disease, which is one of the most serious diseases affecting cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying both rice defense and fungal attack are not yet fully understood. Extensive past studies have characterized many infection-responsive genes in the pathogen and host plant, separately. To understand the plant-pathogen interaction comprehensively, it is valuable to monitor the gene expression profiles of both interacting organisms simultaneously in the same infected plant tissue. Although the host-pathogen interaction during the initial infection stage is important for the establishment of infection, the detection of fungal gene expression in infected leaves at the stage has been difficult because very few numbers of fungal cells are present. Using the emerging RNA-Seq technique, which has a wide dynamic range for expression analyses, we analyzed the mixed transcriptome of rice and blast fungus in infected leaves at 24 hours post-inoculation, which is the point when the primary infection hyphae penetrate leaf epidermal cells. We demonstrated that our method detected the gene expression of both the host plant and pathogen simultaneously in the same infected leaf blades in natural infection conditions without any artificial treatments. The upregulation of 240 fungal transcripts encoding putative secreted proteins was observed, suggesting that these candidates of fungal effector genes may play important roles in initial infection processes. The upregulation of transcripts encoding glycosyl hydrolases, cutinases and LysM domain-containing proteins were observed in the blast fungus, whereas pathogenesis-related and phytoalexin biosynthetic genes were upregulated in rice. Furthermore, more drastic changes in expression were observed in the incompatible interactions compared with the compatible ones in both rice and blast fungus at this stage. Our mixed transcriptome analysis is useful for the simultaneous elucidation of the tactics of host plant defense and pathogen attack.",filamentous fungus magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease one serious disease affecting cultivated rice oryza sativa however molecular mechanism underlying rice defense fungal attack yet fully understood extensive past study characterized many infectionresponsive gene pathogen host plant separately understand plantpathogen interaction comprehensively valuable monitor gene expression profile interacting organism simultaneously infected plant tissue although hostpathogen interaction initial infection stage important establishment infection detection fungal gene expression infected leaf stage difficult number fungal cell present using emerging rnaseq technique wide dynamic range expression analysis analyzed mixed transcriptome rice blast fungus infected leaf hour postinoculation point primary infection hypha penetrate leaf epidermal cell demonstrated method detected gene expression host plant pathogen simultaneously infected leaf blade natural infection condition without artificial treatment upregulation fungal transcript encoding putative secreted protein observed suggesting candidate fungal effector gene may play important role initial infection process upregulation transcript encoding glycosyl hydrolases cutinases lysm domaincontaining protein observed blast fungus whereas pathogenesisrelated phytoalexin biosynthetic gene upregulated rice furthermore drastic change expression observed incompatible interaction compared compatible one rice blast fungus stage mixed transcriptome analysis useful simultaneous elucidation tactic host plant defense pathogen attack,3,"{'Disease': ['filamentous fungus magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease', 'one serious disease', 'mixed transcriptome rice blast fungus infected leaf hour postinoculation point primary infection hypha', 'blast fungus', 'compatible one rice blast fungus stage'], 'Treatment': ['artificial treatment upregulation fungal transcript'], 'Symptom': ['putative secreted protein observed suggesting candidate fungal effector gene']}",7
17022177,"Inducible overexpression of a rice allene oxide synthase gene increases the endogenous jasmonic acid level, PR gene expression, and host resistance to fungal infection.","Many studies in dicotyledonous plants have shown that jasmonates, including jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate, are important signal molecules involved in induced resistance to pathogen infection and insect herbivory. However, very little genetic and molecular evidence is available to demonstrate their role in host defense response of rice and other economically important monocot plants. In this study, we have shown that exogenous application of JA was able to activate defense gene expression and local induced resistance in rice seedlings against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea). Furthermore, we have characterized a pathogen-inducible rice OsAOS2 gene (which encodes allene oxide synthase, a key enzyme in the JA biosynthetic pathway) and examined the role of endogenous JA in rice defense response through transgenic manipulation of the JA biosynthesis. Sequence analysis indicated that OsAOS2 contains four common domains of the cytochrome P450 enzyme, but does not have the signal peptide for chloroplast targeting. The basal level of OsAOS2 expression is very low in leaves but relatively high in the sheath, culm, and flower of rice plants. Interestingly, the expression of OsAOS2 in rice leaves can be induced significantly upon M. grisea infection. Transgenic rice lines carrying the OsAOS2 transgene under the control of a strong, pathogen-inducible PBZ1 promoter accumulated abundant OsAOS2 transcripts and higher levels of JA, especially after the pathogen infection. These transgenic lines also exhibited enhanced activation of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes such as PR1a, PR3, and PR5 and increased resistance to M. grisea infection.

29684060,MoYvh1 subverts rice defense through functions of ribosomal protein MoMrt4 in Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rice is important in its interaction with the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae during which the pathogen scavenges ROS through the production of extracellular enzymes that promote blast. We previously characterized the MoYvh1 protein phosphatase from M. oryzae that plays a role in scavenging of ROS. To understand the underlying mechanism, we found that MoYvh1 is translocated into the nucleus following oxidative stress and that this translocation is dependent on MoSsb1 and MoSsz1 that are homologous to heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) proteins. In addition, we established a link between MoYvh1 and MoMrt4, a ribosome maturation factor homolog whose function also involves shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Moreover, we found that MoYvh1 regulates the production of extracellular proteins that modulate rice-immunity. Taking together, our evidence suggests that functions of MoYvh1 in regulating ROS scavenging require its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the partner proteins MoSsb1 and MoSsz1, as well as MoMrt4. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism by which M. oryzae responds to and subverts host immunity through the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein biosynthesis.",accumulation reactive oxygen specie ro rice important interaction rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae pathogen scavenges ro production extracellular enzyme promote blast previously characterized moyvh protein phosphatase oryzae play role scavenging ro understand underlying mechanism found moyvh translocated nucleus following oxidative stress translocation dependent mossb mossz homologous heatshock protein hsp protein addition established link moyvh momrt ribosome maturation factor homolog whose function also involves shuttling cytoplasm nucleus moreover found moyvh regulates production extracellular protein modulate riceimmunity taking together evidence suggests function moyvh regulating ro scavenging require nucleocytoplasmic shuttling partner protein mossb mossz well momrt finding provide novel insight mechanism oryzae responds subverts host immunity regulation ribosome biogenesis protein biosynthesis,3,"{'Disease': ['rice important interaction rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae pathogen scavenges'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2

37871165,Characterization of Rice-<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Interactions by Hyperspectral Imaging.,"Hyperspectral imaging has the potential to detect, characterize, and quantify plant diseases objectively and nondestructively to improve phenotyping in breeding for disease resistance. In this study, leaf spectral reflectance characteristics of five rice genotypes diseased with blast caused by three <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> isolates differing in virulence were compared with visual disease ratings under greenhouse conditions. Spectral information (140 wavebands, range 450 to 850 nm) of infected leaves was recorded with a hyperspectral imaging microscope at 3, 5, and 7 days postinoculation to examine differences in symptom phenotypes and to characterize the compatibility of host-pathogen interactions. Depending on the rice genotype × <i>M. oryzae</i> genotype interaction, blast symptoms varied from tiny necrosis to enlarged lesions with symptom subareas differing in tissue coloration and indicated gene-for-gene-specific interactions. The blast symptom types were differentiated based on their spectral characteristics in the visible/near-infrared range. Symptom-specific spectral signatures and differences in the composition of leaf blast symptom type(s) resulted in unique spectral and spatial patterns of the rice × <i>M. oryzae</i> interactions based on the size, shape, and color of the symptom subareas. Spectral angle mapper classification of spectra enabled (i) discrimination between healthy (green) and diseased tissue of rice genotypes, (ii) classification and quantification of different blast symptom subareas, and (iii) grading of the host-pathogen compatibility (low - intermediate - high).

15490880,[Relationship between genetic lineage and pathotype of Pyricularia grisea in Yunnan Plateau].,"Rice blast caused by Pyricularia grisea is the most destructive disease in Yunnan Plateau, China. In order to elucidate the relationship between genetic lineage and pathotype of P. grisea of Yunnan Plateau as well as the variability of the fungus at DNA level,the repetitive element-based PCR (rep-PCR) of Pot2, an element found in approximately 100 copies in the fungus genome,was exploited. Two hundred and thirty-six isolates of P. grisea collected from 15 main rice-growing counties of Yunnan Plateau were fingerprinted by using rep-PCR. A linkage graph of the rep-PCR fingerprints from 134 representative isolates was generated using an unweighted pair-grouped average program (UPGMA) of the STATISTICAL 5.0 software. The isolates were classified into 8 genetic lineages (G1 approximately G8) at the level of 1.75 genetic linkage distance, of which the G1, G2 and G4 were the dominant lineages. The isolates in a certain area generally belonged to one correspondent genetic lineage and the isolates from the same plot and host rice variety mostly shared one linkage group though different genetic lineages within one lesion. Furthermore, 29 isolates representing the eight genetic lineages were inoculated on 33 rice cultivars of Yunnan at the stage of 3 approximately 4 leaves in greenhouse. The isolates were divided into 6 pathotype groups (P1 approximately P6) according to its compatibility, which demonstrated that some isolates of one genetic lineage sharing two or three pathotype groups, alternatively, one or four pathotype groups. The isolates from each genetic lineage, however, may share one pathotype group such as P2. The preliminary results implicated that the relationship between genetic lineages and pathotype groups of P. grisea in Yunnan Plateau was complicated rather than simple. On the other hand,2 rice cultivars including HeXi 16 and JingGuo 92 were resistant to the 29 isolates but YunJing 20 and HeXi 30 both susceptible to all of them, which was helpful for deploying the blast-resistant genes in rice production of Yunnan Plateau. Therefore, the rice blast-resistance spectrum of the tentative new rice cultivars should be evaluated before its release considering the blast-resistant rice breeding and the practice of rice production in Yunnan Plateau.",rice blast caused pyricularia grisea destructive disease yunnan plateau china order elucidate relationship genetic lineage pathotype p grisea yunnan plateau well variability fungus dna levelthe repetitive elementbased pcr reppcr pot element found approximately copy fungus genomewas exploited two hundred thirtysix isolates p grisea collected main ricegrowing county yunnan plateau fingerprinted using reppcr linkage graph reppcr fingerprint representative isolates generated using unweighted pairgrouped average program upgma statistical software isolates classified genetic lineage g approximately g level genetic linkage distance g g g dominant lineage isolates certain area generally belonged one correspondent genetic lineage isolates plot host rice variety mostly shared one linkage group though different genetic lineage within one lesion furthermore isolates representing eight genetic lineage inoculated rice cultivar yunnan stage approximately leaf greenhouse isolates divided pathotype group p approximately p according compatibility demonstrated isolates one genetic lineage sharing two three pathotype group alternatively one four pathotype group isolates genetic lineage however may share one pathotype group p preliminary result implicated relationship genetic lineage pathotype group p grisea yunnan plateau complicated rather simple hand rice cultivar including hexi jingguo resistant isolates yunjing hexi susceptible helpful deploying blastresistant gene rice production yunnan plateau therefore rice blastresistance spectrum tentative new rice cultivar evaluated release considering blastresistant rice breeding practice rice production yunnan plateau,13,"{'Disease': ['variability fungus dna', 'fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
27641772,Immunity to Rice Blast Disease by Suppression of Effector-Triggered Necrosis.,"Hemibiotrophic pathogens are some of the most destructive plant pathogens, causing huge economic losses and threatening global food security. Infection with these organisms often involves an initial biotrophic infection phase, during which the pathogen spreads in host tissue asymptomatically, followed by a necrotrophic phase, during which host-cell death is induced. How hemibiotrophic pathogens trigger host necrosis and how plants inhibit the transition from the biotrophic stage to the necrotrophic stage in disease symptom expression are mainly unknown. The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae spreads in rice biotrophically early during infection, but this biotrophic stage is followed by a pronounced switch to cell death and lesion formation. Here, we show that the M. oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with the bZIP-type transcription factor APIP5 in the cytoplasm and suppresses its transcriptional activity and protein accumulation at the necrotrophic stage. Silencing of APIP5 in transgenic rice leads to cell death, and the phenotype is enhanced by the expression of AvrPiz-t. Conversely, Piz-t interacts with and stabilizes APIP5 to prevent necrosis at the necrotrophic stage. At the same time, APIP5 is essential for Piz-t stability. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for the suppression of effector-triggered necrosis at the necrotrophic stage by an NLR receptor in plants.",hemibiotrophic pathogen destructive plant pathogen causing huge economic loss threatening global food security infection organism often involves initial biotrophic infection phase pathogen spread host tissue asymptomatically followed necrotrophic phase hostcell death induced hemibiotrophic pathogen trigger host necrosis plant inhibit transition biotrophic stage necrotrophic stage disease symptom expression mainly unknown rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae spread rice biotrophically early infection biotrophic stage followed pronounced switch cell death lesion formation show oryzae effector avrpizt interacts bziptype transcription factor apip cytoplasm suppresses transcriptional activity protein accumulation necrotrophic stage silencing apip transgenic rice lead cell death phenotype enhanced expression avrpizt conversely pizt interacts stabilizes apip prevent necrosis necrotrophic stage time apip essential pizt stability result demonstrate novel mechanism suppression effectortriggered necrosis necrotrophic stage nlr receptor plant,3,"{'Disease': ['hemibiotrophic pathogen trigger host necrosis plant inhibit transition biotrophic stage necrotrophic stage disease symptom expression', 'mainly unknown rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['hemibiotrophic pathogen trigger host necrosis plant inhibit transition biotrophic stage necrotrophic stage disease symptom expression', 'oryzae effector avrpizt']}",7
34236674,The Biology of Invasive Growth by the Rice Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"This introductory chapter describes the life cycle of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. During plant infection, M. oryzae forms a specialized infection structure called an appressorium, which generates enormous turgor, applied as a mechanical force to breach the rice cuticle. Appressoria form in response to physical cues from the hydrophobic rice leaf cuticle and nutrient availability. The signaling pathways involved in perception of surface signals are described and the mechanism by which appressoria function is also introduced. Re-polarization of the appressorium requires a septin complex to organize a toroidal F-actin network at the base of the cell. Septin aggregation requires a turgor-dependent sensor kinase, Sln1, necessary for re-polarization of the appressorium and development of a rigid penetration hypha to rupture the leaf cuticle. Once inside the plant, the fungus undergoes secretion of a large set of effector proteins, many of which are directed into plant cells using a specific secretory pathway. Here they suppress plant immunity, but can also be perceived by rice immune receptors, triggering resistances. M. oryzae then manipulates pit field sites, containing plasmodesmata, to facilitate rapid spread from cell to cell in plant tissue, leading to disease symptom development.",introductory chapter describes life cycle magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease plant infection oryzae form specialized infection structure called appressorium generates enormous turgor applied mechanical force breach rice cuticle appressoria form response physical cue hydrophobic rice leaf cuticle nutrient availability signaling pathway involved perception surface signal described mechanism appressoria function also introduced repolarization appressorium requires septin complex organize toroidal factin network base cell septin aggregation requires turgordependent sensor kinase sln necessary repolarization appressorium development rigid penetration hypha rupture leaf cuticle inside plant fungus undergoes secretion large set effector protein many directed plant cell using specific secretory pathway suppress plant immunity also perceived rice immune receptor triggering resistance oryzae manipulates pit field site containing plasmodesmata facilitate rapid spread cell cell plant tissue leading disease symptom development,3,"{'Disease': ['plant fungus undergoes secretion', 'plasmodesmata facilitate rapid spread cell cell plant tissue leading disease symptom development'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['large set effector protein', 'plasmodesmata facilitate rapid spread cell cell plant tissue leading disease symptom development']}",9
10425606,An electron-conformational method of identification of pharmacophore and anti-pharmacophore shielding: application to rice blast activity.,"In extension and improvement of previous results, a novel method is worked out for pharmacophore identification and activity prediction in structure-activity relationships. In this method, as in our previous works, each molecular system (conformation) of the training set is described by a matrix with both electron structural parameters (atomic charges, bond orders, etc.) and interatomic distances as matrix elements. This description includes a rather full geometry of charge and/or reactivity distribution thus providing a much better representation of the molecular properties in their interaction with the target. By multiple comparison of these matrices for the active and inactive compounds of the training set, a relatively small number of matrix elements are revealed that are common for all the active compounds and are not present in the same combination in the inactive ones. In this way a set of electronic and geometry parameters is obtained that characterize the pharmacophore (Pha). A major improvement of this scheme is reached by introducing the anti-pharmacophore shielding (APS) and a proper treatment of the conformational problem. The APS is defined as molecular groups and competing charges outside the basic skeleton (the Pha plus the inert neighbor atoms that do not affect the activity) that hinder the proper docking of the Pha with the bioreceptor thus diminishing (partially or completely) the activity. A simple empirical formula is derived to estimate the relative contribution of APS numerically. Two main issues are most affected by the APS: (1) the procedure of Pha identification is essentially simplified because only a small number of molecular systems with the highest activity and simplest structures (systems without APS) should be tried for this purpose; (2) with the APS known numerically, we can make a quantitative (or semiquantitative) prediction of relative activities. The contributions of different conformations (of the same molecular system) that possess the Pha and different APS is taken into account by means of a Boltzmann distribution at given temperatures. Applied to an example, rice blast activity, this approach proved to be rather robust and efficient. In validation of the method, the screening of 39 new compounds yields approximately 100% (within experimental error) prediction probability of the activity qualitatively (yes, no), and with r2 = 0.66 quantitatively.",extension improvement previous result novel method worked pharmacophore identification activity prediction structureactivity relationship method previous work molecular system conformation training set described matrix electron structural parameter atomic charge bond order etc interatomic distance matrix element description includes rather full geometry charge andor reactivity distribution thus providing much better representation molecular property interaction target multiple comparison matrix active inactive compound training set relatively small number matrix element revealed common active compound present combination inactive one way set electronic geometry parameter obtained characterize pharmacophore pha major improvement scheme reached introducing antipharmacophore shielding aps proper treatment conformational problem aps defined molecular group competing charge outside basic skeleton pha plus inert neighbor atom affect activity hinder proper docking pha bioreceptor thus diminishing partially completely activity simple empirical formula derived estimate relative contribution aps numerically two main issue affected aps procedure pha identification essentially simplified small number molecular system highest activity simplest structure system without aps tried purpose aps known numerically make quantitative semiquantitative prediction relative activity contribution different conformation molecular system possess pha different aps taken account mean boltzmann distribution given temperature applied example rice blast activity approach proved rather robust efficient validation method screening new compound yield approximately within experimental error prediction probability activity qualitatively yes r quantitatively,6,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['previous result novel method', 'pharmacophore identification activity prediction structureactivity relationship method', 'proper treatment conformational problem aps', 'rather robust efficient validation method'], 'Symptom': []}",0
17073304,The eight amino-acid differences within three leucine-rich repeats between Pi2 and Piz-t resistance proteins determine the resistance specificity to Magnaporthe grisea.,"The rice blast resistance (R) genes Pi2 and Piz-t confer broad-spectrum resistance against different sets of Magnaporthe grisea isolates. We first identified the Pi2 gene using a map-based cloning strategy. The Pi2 gene is a member of a gene cluster comprising nine gene members (named Nbs1-Pi2 to Nbs9-Pi2) and encodes a protein with a nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Fine genetic mapping, molecular characterization of the Pi2 susceptible mutants, and complementation tests indicated that Nbs4-Pi2 is the Pi2 gene. The Piz-t gene, a Pi2 allele in the rice cultivar Toride 1, was isolated based on the Pi2 sequence information. Complementation tests confirmed that the family member Nbs4-Piz-t is Piz-t. Sequence comparison revealed that only eight amino-acid changes, which are confined within three consecutive LRR, differentiate Piz-t from Pi2. Of the eight variants, only one locates within the xxLxLxx motif. A reciprocal exchange of the single amino acid between Pi2 and Piz-t did not convert the resistance specificity to each other but, rather, abolished the function of both resistance proteins.

36897889,Phenotypic and Genotypic screening of fifty-two rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes for desirable cultivars against blast disease.,"Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus, is one of the most dangerous rice pathogens, causing considerable crop losses around the world. In order to explore the rice blast-resistant sources, initially performed a large-scale screening of 277 rice accessions. In parallel with field evaluations, fifty-two rice accessions were genotyped for 25 major blast resistance genes utilizing functional/gene-based markers based on their reactivity against rice blast disease. According to the phenotypic examination, 29 (58%) and 22 (42%) entries were found to be highly resistant, 18 (36%) and 29 (57%) showed moderate resistance, and 05 (6%) and 01 (1%), respectively, were highly susceptible to leaf and neck blast. The genetic frequency of 25 major blast resistance genes ranged from 32 to 60%, with two genotypes having a maximum of 16 R-genes each. The 52 rice accessions were divided into two groups based on cluster and population structure analysis. The highly resistant and moderately resistant accessions are divided into different groups using the principal coordinate analysis. According to the analysis of molecular variance, the maximum diversity was found within the population, while the minimum diversity was found between the populations. Two markers (RM5647 and K39512), which correspond to the blast-resistant genes Pi36 and Pik, respectively, showed a significant association to the neck blast disease, whereas three markers (Pi2-i, Pita3, and k2167), which correspond to the blast-resistant genes Pi2, Pita/Pita2, and Pikm, respectively, showed a significant association to the leaf blast disease.

In the present study, we investigated the functional roles of OsCOL9 in blast resistance. OsCOL9 belonged to group II of the COL protein family, and it contained a BB-box and a C-terminal CCT (CONSTANS, COL and TOC1) domain. OsCOL9 was found in the nucleus of rice cells, and it exerted transcriptional activation activities through its middle region (MR). Magnaporthe oryzae infection induced OsCOL9 expression, and transgenic OsCOL9 knock-out rice plants showed increased pathogen susceptibility. OsCOL9 was a critical regulator of pathogen-related genes, especially PR1b, which were also activated by exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylicacid (ACC), the precursor of ethylene (ET). Further analysis indicated that OsCOL9 over-expression increased the expressions of phytohormone biosynthetic genes, NPR1, WRKY45, OsACO1 and OsACS1, which were related to SA and ET biosynthesis. Interestingly, we found that OsCOL9 physically interacted with the scaffold protein OsRACK1 through its CCT domain, and the OsRACK1 expression was induced in response to exogenous SA and ACC as well as M. oryzae infection. Taken together, these results indicated that the COL protein OsCOL9 interacted with OsRACK1, and it enhanced the rice blast resistance through SA and ET signaling pathways.",previous transcriptome analysis early response gene rice magnaporthe oryzae infection identified constanslike col gene oscol present study investigated functional role oscol blast resistance oscol belonged group ii col protein family contained bbbox cterminal cct constans col toc domain oscol found nucleus rice cell exerted transcriptional activation activity middle region mr magnaporthe oryzae infection induced oscol expression transgenic oscol knockout rice plant showed increased pathogen susceptibility oscol critical regulator pathogenrelated gene especially prb also activated exogenous salicylic acid sa aminocyclopropanecarboxylicacid acc precursor ethylene et analysis indicated oscol overexpression increased expression phytohormone biosynthetic gene npr wrky osaco osacs related sa et biosynthesis interestingly found oscol physically interacted scaffold protein osrack cct domain osrack expression induced response exogenous sa acc well oryzae infection taken together result indicated col protein oscol interacted osrack enhanced rice blast resistance sa et signaling pathway,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
17576597,"Identification and fine mapping of Pi39(t), a major gene conferring the broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.","Blast, caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. The Chinese native cultivar (cv.) Q15 expresses the broad-spectrum resistance to most of the isolates collected from China. To effectively utilize the resistance, three rounds of linkage analysis were performed in an F(2) population derived from a cross of Q15 and a susceptible cv. Tsuyuake, which segregated into 3:1 (resistant/susceptible) ratio. The first round of linkage analysis employing simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was carried out in the F(2) population through bulked-segregant assay. A total of 180 SSR markers selected from each chromosome equally were surveyed. The results revealed that only two polymorphic markers, RM247 and RM463, located on chromosome 12, were linked to the resistance (R) gene. To further define the chromosomal location of the R gene locus, the second round of linkage analysis was performed using additional five SSR markers, which located in the region anchored by markers RM247 and RM463. The locus was further mapped to a 0.27 cM region bounded by markers RM27933 and RM27940 in the pericentromeric region towards the short arm. For fine mapping of the R locus, seven new markers were developed in the smaller region for the third round of linkage analysis, based on the reference sequences. The R locus was further mapped to a 0.18 cM region flanked by marker clusters 39M11 and 39M22, which is closest to, but away from the Pita/Pita(2) locus by 0.09 cM. To physically map the locus, all the linked markers were landed on the respective bacterial artificial chromosome clones of the reference cv. Nipponbare. Sequence information of these clones was used to construct a physical map of the locus, in silico, by bioinformatics analysis. The locus was physically defined to an interval of approximately 37 kb. To further characterize the R gene, five R genes mapped near the locus, as well as 10 main R genes those might be exploited in the resistance breeding programs, were selected for differential tests with 475 Chinese isolates. The R gene carrier Q15 conveys resistances distinct from those conditioned by the carriers of the 15 R genes. Together, this valuable R gene was, therefore, designated as Pi39(t).

9652390,The defense-related rice gene Pir7b encodes an alpha/beta hydrolase fold protein exhibiting esterase activity towards naphthol AS-esters.,"Acquired resistance of rice to Pyricularia oryzae, the causing agent of rice blast, can be induced by inoculation with the non-host pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. We have previously cloned a cDNA and a corresponding gene (Pir7b) whose transcripts accumulate upon infiltration with the resistance-inducing bacteria. The putative encoded product Pir7b exhibits significant sequence similarity to two recently cloned hydroxynitrile lyases from Manihot esculenta (cassava) and Hevea brasisliensis, enzymes involved in the release of hydrogen cyanide from cyanogenic glycosides. As rice does not contain cyanogenic glycosides, a similar function of Pir7b appears unplausible. In order to functionally characterize the protein, recombinant Pir7b was produced in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that recombinant Pir7b does not have hydroxynitrile lyase activity, but exhibits esterase activity towards naphthol AS-acetate. Using Pir7b-specific antibodies, we show that the protein accumulates in rice leaves inoculated with P. syringae pv. syringae. Both the recombinant and the authentic proteins have an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (28.8 kDa calculated) and seem to be active as monomers.

Four NBS-LRR genes are present in the target region of cv. Nipponbare, and a presence/absence analysis in the Pik-p carrier cv. K60 excluded two of these as candidates for Pik-p. The other two candidates (KP3 and KP4) were expressed in cv. K60. A loss-of-function experiment by RNAi showed that both KP3 and KP4 are required for Pik-p function, while a gain-of-function experiment by complementation test revealed that neither KP3 nor KP4 on their own can impart resistance, but that resistance was expressed when both were introduced simultaneously.

19390617,A novel pathogenicity gene is required in the rice blast fungus to suppress the basal defenses of the host.,"For successful colonization and further reproduction in host plants, pathogens need to overcome the innate defenses of the plant. We demonstrate that a novel pathogenicity gene, DES1, in Magnaporthe oryzae regulates counter-defenses against host basal resistance. The DES1 gene was identified by screening for pathogenicity-defective mutants in a T-DNA insertional mutant library. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that this gene encodes a serine-rich protein that has unknown biochemical properties, and its homologs are strictly conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes. Targeted gene deletion of DES1 had no apparent effect on developmental morphogenesis, including vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, and appressorium-mediated penetration. Conidial size of the mutant became smaller than that of the wild type, but the mutant displayed no defects on cell wall integrity. The Deltades1 mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous oxidative stress and the activity and transcription level of extracellular enzymes including peroxidases and laccases were severely decreased in the mutant. In addition, ferrous ion leakage was observed in the Deltades1 mutant. In the interaction with a susceptible rice cultivar, rice cells inoculated with the Deltades1 mutant exhibited strong defense responses accompanied by brown granules in primary infected cells, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the generation of autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction in neighboring tissues. The Deltades1 mutant displayed a significant reduction in infectious hyphal extension, which caused a decrease in pathogenicity. Notably, the suppression of ROS generation by treatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, resulted in a significant reduction in the defense responses in plant tissues challenged with the Deltades1 mutant. Furthermore, the Deltades1 mutant recovered its normal infectious growth in DPI-treated plant tissues. These results suggest that DES1 functions as a novel pathogenicity gene that regulates the activity of fungal proteins, compromising ROS-mediated plant defense.",successful colonization reproduction host plant pathogen need overcome innate defense plant demonstrate novel pathogenicity gene de magnaporthe oryzae regulates counterdefenses host basal resistance de gene identified screening pathogenicitydefective mutant tdna insertional mutant library bioinformatic analysis revealed gene encodes serinerich protein unknown biochemical property homologs strictly conserved filamentous ascomycete targeted gene deletion de apparent effect developmental morphogenesis including vegetative growth conidial germination appressorium formation appressoriummediated penetration conidial size mutant became smaller wild type mutant displayed defect cell wall integrity deltades mutant hypersensitive exogenous oxidative stress activity transcription level extracellular enzyme including peroxidase laccases severely decreased mutant addition ferrous ion leakage observed deltades mutant interaction susceptible rice cultivar rice cell inoculated deltades mutant exhibited strong defense response accompanied brown granule primary infected cell accumulation reactive oxygen specie ro generation autofluorescent material pr gene induction neighboring tissue deltades mutant displayed significant reduction infectious hyphal extension caused decrease pathogenicity notably suppression ro generation treatment diphenyleneiodonium dpi inhibitor nadph oxidase resulted significant reduction defense response plant tissue challenged deltades mutant furthermore deltades mutant recovered normal infectious growth dpitreated plant tissue result suggest de function novel pathogenicity gene regulates activity fungal protein compromising rosmediated plant defense,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['generation treatment diphenyleneiodonium'], 'Symptom': []}",12

We contrast the ability of M. oryzae to voraciously metabolize a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources in vitro with the carefully orchestrated development it displays during the biotrophic phase of in planta growth and ask how the two observations can be reconciled.

Gigante Vercelli (GV) and Vialone Nano (VN) are two old temperate japonica Italian rice cultivars with contrasting response to blast infection: GV displays durable and broad resistance while VN is highly susceptible. RNA-seq was used to dissect the early molecular processes deployed during the resistance response of GV at 24 h after blast inoculation. Differential gene expression analysis identified 1,070 and 1,484 modulated genes, of which 726 and 699 were up regulated in response to infection in GV and VN, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed a set of GO terms enriched in both varieties but, despite this commonality, the gene sets contributing to common GO enriched terms were dissimilar. The expression patterns of genes grouped in GV-specific enriched GO terms were examined in detail including at the transcript isoform level. GV exhibited a dramatic up-regulation of genes encoding diterpene phytoalexin biosynthetic enzymes, flavin-containing monooxygenase, class I chitinase and glycosyl hydrolase 17. The sensitivity and high dynamic range of RNA-seq allowed the identification of genes critically involved in conferring GV resistance during the early steps of defence perception-signalling.

16167766,Pathogen-induced production of the antifungal AFP protein from Aspergillus giganteus confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea in transgenic rice.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe grisea, is the most important fungal disease of cultivated rice worldwide. We have developed a strategy for creating disease resistance to M. grisea whereby pathogen-induced expression of the afp (antifungal protein) gene from Aspergillus giganteus occurs in transgenic rice plants. Here, we evaluated the activity of the promoters from three maize pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, ZmPR4, mpi, and PRms, in transgenic rice. Chimeric gene fusions were prepared between the maize promoters and the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (gus A). Histochemical assays of GUS activity in transgenic rice revealed that the ZmPR4 promoter is strongly induced in response to fungal infection, treatment with fungal elicitors, and mechanical wounding. The ZmPR4 promoter is not active in the seed endosperm. The mpi promoter also proved responsiveness to fungal infection and wounding but not to treatment with elicitors. In contrast, no activity of the PRms promoter in leaves of transgenic rice was observed. Transgenic plants expressing the afp gene under the control of the ZmPR4 promoter were generated. Transformants showed resistance to M. grisea at various levels. Our results suggest that pathogen-inducible expression of the afp gene in rice plants may be a practical way for protection against the blast fungus. Most agricultural crop species suffer from a vast array of fungal diseases that cause severe yield losses all over the world.

39616439,The miR172a-SNB module orchestrates both induced and adult-plant resistance to multiple diseases via MYB30-mediated lignin accumulation in rice.,"Plants mount induced resistance and adult-plant resistance against different pathogens throughout the whole growth period. Rice production faces threats from multiple major diseases, including rice blast, sheath blight, and bacterial leaf blight. Here, we report that the miR172a-SNB-MYB30 module regulates both induced and adult-plant resistance to these three major diseases via lignification in rice. Mechanistically, pathogen infections induce the expression of miR172a, which downregulates the transcription factor SNB to release its suppression of MYB30, leading to an increase in lignin biosynthesis and disease resistance throughout the whole growth period. Moreover, expression levels of miR172a and MYB30 gradually increase and are consistently correlated with lignin contents and disease resistance during rice development, reaching a peak at full maturity, whereas SNB RNA levels are negatively correlated with lignin contents and disease resistance, indicating the involvement of the miR172a-SNB-MYB30 module in adult-plant resistance. The functional domain of SNB protein and its binding sites in the MYB30 promoter are highly conserved among more than 4000 rice accessions, while abnormal expression of miR172a, SNB, or MYB30 compromises yield traits, suggesting artificial selection of the miR172a-SNB-MYB30 module during rice domestication. Taken together, these results reveal a novel role for a conserved miRNA-regulated module that contributes significantly to induced and adult-plant resistance against multiple pathogens by increasing lignin accumulation, deepening our understanding of broad-spectrum resistance and adult-plant resistance.",plant mount induced resistance adultplant resistance different pathogen throughout whole growth period rice production face threat multiple major disease including rice blast sheath blight bacterial leaf blight report mirasnbmyb module regulates induced adultplant resistance three major disease via lignification rice mechanistically pathogen infection induce expression mira downregulates transcription factor snb release suppression myb leading increase lignin biosynthesis disease resistance throughout whole growth period moreover expression level mira myb gradually increase consistently correlated lignin content disease resistance rice development reaching peak full maturity whereas snb rna level negatively correlated lignin content disease resistance indicating involvement mirasnbmyb module adultplant resistance functional domain snb protein binding site myb promoter highly conserved among rice accession abnormal expression mira snb myb compromise yield trait suggesting artificial selection mirasnbmyb module rice domestication taken together result reveal novel role conserved mirnaregulated module contributes significantly induced adultplant resistance multiple pathogen increasing lignin accumulation deepening understanding broadspectrum resistance adultplant resistance,8,"{'Disease': ['whole growth period rice production face threat multiple major disease', 'three major disease', 'suppression myb leading increase lignin biosynthesis disease resistance', 'consistently correlated lignin content disease resistance rice development reaching peak full maturity', 'lignin content disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
28106116,"Overexpression of MoSM1, encoding for an immunity-inducing protein from Magnaporthe oryzae, in rice confers broad-spectrum resistance against fungal and bacterial diseases.","Potential of MoSM1, encoding for a cerato-platanin protein from Magnaporthe oryzae, in improvement of rice disease resistance was examined. Transient expression of MoSM1 in rice leaves initiated hypersensitive response and upregulated expression of defense genes. When transiently expressed in tobacco leaves, MoSM1 targeted to plasma membrane. The MoSM1-overexpressing (MoSM1-OE) transgenic rice lines showed an improved resistance, as revealed by the reduced disease severity and decreased in planta pathogen growth, against 2 strains belonging to two different races of M. oryzae, causing blast disease, and against 2 strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, causing bacterial leaf blight disease. However, no alteration in resistance to sheath blight disease was observed in MoSM1-OE lines. The MoSM1-OE plants contained elevated levels of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) and constitutively activated the expression of SA and JA signaling-related regulatory and defense genes. Furthermore, the MoSM1-OE plants had no effect on drought and salt stress tolerance and on grain yield. We conclude that MoSM1 confers a broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens through modulating SA- and JA-mediated signaling pathways without any penalty on abiotic stress tolerance and grain yield, providing a promising potential for application of MoSM1 in improvement of disease resistance in crops.",potential mosm encoding ceratoplatanin protein magnaporthe oryzae improvement rice disease resistance examined transient expression mosm rice leaf initiated hypersensitive response upregulated expression defense gene transiently expressed tobacco leaf mosm targeted plasma membrane mosmoverexpressing mosmoe transgenic rice line showed improved resistance revealed reduced disease severity decreased planta pathogen growth strain belonging two different race oryzae causing blast disease strain xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae causing bacterial leaf blight disease however alteration resistance sheath blight disease observed mosmoe line mosmoe plant contained elevated level salicylic acid sa jasmonic acid ja constitutively activated expression sa ja signalingrelated regulatory defense gene furthermore mosmoe plant effect drought salt stress tolerance grain yield conclude mosm confers broadspectrum resistance different pathogen modulating sa jamediated signaling pathway without penalty abiotic stress tolerance grain yield providing promising potential application mosm improvement disease resistance crop,4,"{'Disease': ['reduced disease severity', 'blast disease', 'bacterial leaf blight disease', 'sheath blight disease', 'potential application mosm improvement disease resistance crop'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['furthermore mosmoe plant effect drought salt']}",7

18156216,RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice.,"A rice (Oryza sativa) Rac/Rop GTPase, Os Rac1, is involved in innate immunity, but its molecular function is largely unknown. RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species. HSP90 has also recently been shown to be important in mammalian innate immunity. However, their functions at the molecular level are not well understood. In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90. Os RAR1-RNA interference (RNAi) rice plants had impaired basal resistance to a compatible race of the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and the virulent bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. Constitutively active Os Rac1 complemented the loss of resistance, suggesting that Os Rac1 and RAR1 are functionally linked. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo. Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures. Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex. Os Rac1 also regulates RAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice.",rice oryza sativa racrop gtpase o rac involved innate immunity molecular function largely unknown rar required mla resistance hsp heat shock protein kd important component r genemediated disease resistance function conserved several plant specie hsp also recently shown important mammalian innate immunity however function molecular level well understood study examined functional relationship o rac rar hsp o rarrna interference rnai rice plant impaired basal resistance compatible race blast fungus magnaporthe grisea virulent bacterial blight pathogen xanthomonas oryzae constitutively active o rac complemented loss resistance suggesting o rac rar functionally linked coimmunoprecipitation experiment rice cell culture extract indicate rac form complex rar hsp hsp vivo study o rarrnai treatment geldanamycin hspspecific inhibitor showed rar hsp essential racmediated enhancement pathogenassociated molecular patterntriggered immune response rice cell culture furthermore function hsp rar may essential association rac complex o rac also regulates rar expression mrna protein level together result indicate rac rar hsp hsp form one protein complex rice cell suggest protein play important role innate immunity rice,1,"{'Disease': ['functional relationship o rac rar hsp o rarrna interference rnai rice plant impaired basal resistance compatible race blast fungus magnaporthe grisea virulent bacterial blight pathogen xanthomonas oryzae'], 'Treatment': ['rarrnai treatment geldanamycin hspspecific inhibitor'], 'Symptom': []}",7
17322409,Roles for rice membrane dynamics and plasmodesmata during biotrophic invasion by the blast fungus.,"Rice blast disease is caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which invades living plant cells using intracellular invasive hyphae (IH) that grow from one cell to the next. The cellular and molecular processes by which this occurs are not understood. We applied live-cell imaging to characterize the spatial and temporal development of IH and plant responses inside successively invaded rice (Oryza sativa) cells. Loading experiments with the endocytotic tracker FM4-64 showed dynamic plant membranes around IH. IH were sealed in a plant membrane, termed the extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM), which showed multiple connections to peripheral rice cell membranes. The IH switched between pseudohyphal and filamentous growth. Successive cell invasions were biotrophic, although each invaded cell appeared to have lost viability when the fungus moved into adjacent cells. EIHM formed distinct membrane caps at the tips of IH that initially grew in neighboring cells. Time-lapse imaging showed IH scanning plant cell walls before crossing, and transmission electron microscopy showed IH preferentially contacting or crossing cell walls at pit fields. This and additional evidence strongly suggest that IH co-opt plasmodesmata for cell-to-cell movement. Analysis of biotrophic blast invasion will significantly contribute to our understanding of normal plant processes and allow the characterization of secreted fungal effectors that affect these processes.",rice blast disease caused hemibiotrophic fungus magnaporthe oryzae invades living plant cell using intracellular invasive hypha ih grow one cell next cellular molecular process occurs understood applied livecell imaging characterize spatial temporal development ih plant response inside successively invaded rice oryza sativa cell loading experiment endocytotic tracker fm showed dynamic plant membrane around ih ih sealed plant membrane termed extrainvasive hyphal membrane eihm showed multiple connection peripheral rice cell membrane ih switched pseudohyphal filamentous growth successive cell invasion biotrophic although invaded cell appeared lost viability fungus moved adjacent cell eihm formed distinct membrane cap tip ih initially grew neighboring cell timelapse imaging showed ih scanning plant cell wall crossing transmission electron microscopy showed ih preferentially contacting crossing cell wall pit field additional evidence strongly suggest ih coopt plasmodesmata celltocell movement analysis biotrophic blast invasion significantly contribute understanding normal plant process allow characterization secreted fungal effector affect process,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'viability fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['characterization secreted fungal effector']}",7

37595851,Unraveling the transcriptional network regulated by miRNAs in blast-resistant and blast-susceptible rice genotypes during Magnaporthe oryzae interaction.,"The plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae poses a significant threat to global food security, and its management through the cultivation of resistant varieties and crop husbandry practices, including fungicidal sprays, has proven to be inadequate. To address this issue, we conducted small-RNA sequencing to identify the roles of miRNAs and their target genes in both resistant (PB1637) and susceptible (PB1) rice genotypes. We confirmed the expression of differentially expressed miRNAs using stem-loop qRT-PCR analysis and correlated them with rice patho-phenotypic and physio-biochemical responses. Our findings revealed several noteworthy differences between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. The resistant genotype exhibited reduced levels of total chlorophyll and carotenoids compared to the susceptible genotype. However, it showed increased levels of total protein, callose, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, antioxidants, flavonoids, and total polyphenols. Additionally, among the defense-associated enzymes, guaiacol peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase responses were higher in the susceptible genotypes. In our comparative analysis, we identified 27 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated miRNAs in the resistant genotype, while the susceptible genotype exhibited 44 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated miRNAs. Furthermore, we discovered eight up-regulated and five down-regulated miRNAs shared between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Notably, we also identified six novel miRNAs in the resistant genotype and eight novel miRNAs in the susceptible genotype. These novel miRNAs, namely Chr8_26996, Chr12_40110, and Chr12_41899, were found to negatively correlate with the expression of predicted target genes, including Cyt-P450 monooxygenase, serine carboxypeptidase, and zinc finger A20 domain-containing stress-associated protein, respectively. The results of our study on miRNA and transcriptional responses provide valuable insights for the development of future rice lines that are resistant to blast disease.

17587305,Functional analysis of a NAC-type transcription factor OsNAC6 involved in abiotic and biotic stress-responsive gene expression in rice.,"The OsNAC6 gene is a member of the NAC transcription factor gene family in rice. Expression of OsNAC6 is induced by abiotic stresses, including cold, drought and high salinity. OsNAC6 gene expression is also induced by wounding and blast disease. A transactivation assay using a yeast system demonstrated that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator, and transient localization studies with OsNAC6-sGFP fusion protein revealed its nuclear localization. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6 constitutively exhibited growth retardation and low reproductive yields. These transgenic rice plants showed an improved tolerance to dehydration and high-salt stresses, and also exhibited increased tolerance to blast disease. By utilizing stress-inducible promoters, such as the OsNAC6 promoter, it is hoped that stress-inducible over-expression of OsNAC6 in rice can improve stress tolerance by suppressing the negative effects of OsNAC6 on growth under normal growth conditions. The results of microarray analysis revealed that many genes that are inducible by abiotic and biotic stresses were upregulated in rice plants over-expressing OsNAC6. A transient transactivation assay showed that OsNAC6 activates the expression of at least two genes, including a gene encoding peroxidase. Collectively, these results indicate that OsNAC6 functions as a transcriptional activator in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants.

Here, we curiously found that an <i>OsF3H04g</i> knock-out mutant created by T-DNA insertion, <i>osf3h04g</i>, was remarkedly susceptible to BLS and BB and showed an extreme reduction in SA content. <i>OsF3H04g</i> knock-out rice lines produced by gene-editing were mildly susceptible to BLS and reduced content of SA. To explore the susceptibility mechanism in <i>OsF3H04g</i> loss-of-function rice lines, transcriptome sequencing revealed that another homolog, <i>OsS3H</i>, had induced expression in the loss-of-function <i>OsF3H04g</i> rice lines. Furthermore, we confirmed that a great induction of <i>OsS3H</i> downstream and genomically adjacent to <i>OsF3H04g</i> in <i>osf3h04g</i> was primarily related to the inserted T-DNA carrying quadruple enhancer elements of <i>35S</i>, while a slight induction was caused by an unknown mechanism in gene-editing lines. Then, we found that the overexpression of <i>OsS3H</i> increased rice susceptibility to BLS, while gene-editing mediated the loss-of-function <i>OsS3H</i> enhanced rice resistance to BLS. However, the knock-out of both <i>OsF3H04g</i> and <i>OsS3H</i> by gene-editing only neutralized rice resistance to BLS. Thus, we concluded that the knock-out of <i>OsF3H04g</i> activated the expression of the <i>OsS3H</i>, partially participating in the susceptibility to BLS in rice.",downy mildew resistance like dmrlike gene identified salicylic acid sa hydroxylases negative regulator plant immunity previously identified two rice dmrlike gene iosfhgi iosfhgi act susceptible target transcription activatorlike effector tale ixanthomonas oryzaei pv ioryzicolai xoc cause bacterial leaf streak bls rice furthermore four homologs rice dmrlike protein identified predominantly carry enzyme activity sa hydroxylase sh negatively regulate rice broadspectrum resistance cause loss function iosdmrsi leading increased resistance rice blast bacterial blight bb curiously found iosfhgi knockout mutant created tdna insertion iosfhgi remarkedly susceptible bls bb showed extreme reduction sa content iosfhgi knockout rice line produced geneediting mildly susceptible bls reduced content sa explore susceptibility mechanism iosfhgi lossoffunction rice line transcriptome sequencing revealed another homolog iosshi induced expression lossoffunction iosfhgi rice line furthermore confirmed great induction iosshi downstream genomically adjacent iosfhgi iosfhgi primarily related inserted tdna carrying quadruple enhancer element isi slight induction caused unknown mechanism geneediting line found overexpression iosshi increased rice susceptibility bls geneediting mediated lossoffunction iosshi enhanced rice resistance bls however knockout iosfhgi iosshi geneediting neutralized rice resistance bls thus concluded knockout iosfhgi activated expression iosshi partially participating susceptibility bls rice,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['activatorlike effector tale ixanthomonas']}",0
38866764,Ferroptosis induction in host rice by endophyte OsiSh-2 is necessary for mutualism and disease resistance in symbiosis.,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death that was discovered recently. For beneficial microbes to establish mutualistic relationships with hosts, precisely controlled cell death in plant cells is necessary. However, whether ferroptosis is involved in the endophyte‒plant system is poorly understood. Here, we reported that endophytic Streptomyces hygroscopicus OsiSh-2, which established a sophisticated and beneficial interaction with host rice plants, caused ferroptotic cell death in rice characterized by ferroptosis- and immune-related markers. Treatments with ferroptosis inhibitors and inducers, different doses of OsiSh-2, and the siderophore synthesis-deficient mutant ΔcchH revealed that only moderate ferroptosis induced by endophytes is essential for the establishment of an optimal symbiont to enhance plant growth. Additionally, ferroptosis involved in a defence-primed state in rice, which contributed to improved resistance against rice blast disease. Overall, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of endophyte‒plant interactions mediated by ferroptosis and suggests new directions for crop yield promotion.",ferroptosis irondependent cell death discovered recently beneficial microbe establish mutualistic relationship host precisely controlled cell death plant cell necessary however whether ferroptosis involved endophyte‒plant system poorly understood reported endophytic streptomyces hygroscopicus osish established sophisticated beneficial interaction host rice plant caused ferroptotic cell death rice characterized ferroptosis immunerelated marker treatment ferroptosis inhibitor inducer different dos osish siderophore synthesisdeficient mutant δcchh revealed moderate ferroptosis induced endophytes essential establishment optimal symbiont enhance plant growth additionally ferroptosis involved defenceprimed state rice contributed improved resistance rice blast disease overall study provides new insight mechanism endophyte‒plant interaction mediated ferroptosis suggests new direction crop yield promotion,3,"{'Disease': ['improved resistance rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0

20210154,[Study on disease level classification of rice panicle blast based on visible and near infrared spectroscopy].,"Visible and near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy was used to fast and non-destructively classify the disease levels of rice panicle blast. Reflectance spectra between 325 and 1 075 nm were measured. Kennard-Stone algorithm was operated to separate samples into calibration and prediction sets. Different spectral pretreatment methods, including standard normal variate (SNV) and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), were used for the spectral pretreatment before further spectral analysis. A hybrid wavelength variable selection method which is combined with uninformative variable elimination (UVE) and successive projections algorithm (SPA) was operated to select effective wavelength variables from original spectra, SNV pretreated spectra and MSC pretreated spectra, respectively. UVE was firstly operated to remove uninformative wavelength variables from the full-spectrum. Then SPA selected the effective wavelength variables with less colinearity after UVE. Least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) was used as the calibration method for the spectral analysis in this study. The selected effective wavelengths were set as input variables of LS-SVM model. The LS-SVM model established based on SNV-UVE-SPA obtained the best results. Only six effective wavelengths (459, 546, 569, 590, 775 and 981 nm) were selected from the full-spectrum which has 600 wavelength variables by UVE-SPA, and their LS-SVM model's performance was further improved. For SNV-UVE-SPA-LS-SVM model, coefficient of determination for prediction set (R2(p)), root mean square error for prediction (RMSEP) and residual predictive deviation (RPD) were 0.979, 0.507 and 6.580, respectively. The overall results indicate that Vis-NIR spectroscopy is a feasible way to classify disease levels of rice panicle blast fast and non-destructively.

31188736,Establishment of a Rapid Detection Method for Rice Blast Fungus Based on One-Step Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP).,"Rice blast is one of the most serious diseases for rice, and controlling the filamentous fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> that causes rice blast is crucial for global food security. Typically, early infected rice does not show symptoms. Therefore, the early diagnosis of rice blast is particularly important to avoid uncontrollable propagation of rice blast fungus. In the present work, a rapid and efficient loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed to detect the pathogen at the early infected stage of rice. The Alb1 superfamily hypothetical protein MGG_04322, a nuclear shuttling factor involved in ribosome and melanin biogenesis, was chosen as the target for designing the LAMP primers. The LAMP assay enabled rapid detection of as little as 10 pg of pure genomic DNA of <i>M. oryzae</i>. In addition, we established the quantitative LAMP (q-LAMP) detection system to quantify the conidia of rice blast fungus. The q-LAMP assay enabled rapid detection (within 35 min) of the fungal spores at a sensitivity of 3.2 spores/ml. In addition, the assay sets up the linearization formula of the standard curve as <i>y</i> = 0.3066 + 15.33<i>x</i> (where <i>x</i> = amplification of time), inferring that spore number = 10<sup>0.60<i>y</i></sup>. In addition, the q-LAMP assay was successfully used to detect the presence of the virulence strains of <i>M. oryzae</i> (wild type) in comparison with that of the two mutant strains by quantifying the biomass within host tissue.

35821048,An ORFeome of rice E3 ubiquitin ligases for global analysis of the ubiquitination interactome.,"Ubiquitination is essential for many cellular processes in eukaryotes, including 26S proteasome-dependent protein degradation, cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. Although numerous ubiquitinated proteins have been empirically identified, their cognate ubiquitin E3 ligases remain largely unknown. Here, we generate a complete ubiquitin E3 ligase-encoding open reading frames (UbE3-ORFeome) library containing 98.94% of the 1515 E3 ligase genes in the rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome. In the test screens with four known ubiquitinated proteins, we identify both known and new E3s. The interaction and degradation between several E3s and their substrates are confirmed in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we identify the F-box E3 ligase OsFBK16 as a hub-interacting protein of the phenylalanine ammonia lyase family OsPAL1-OsPAL7. We demonstrate that OsFBK16 promotes the degradation of OsPAL1, OsPAL5, and OsPAL6. Remarkably, we find that overexpression of OsPAL1 or OsPAL6 as well as loss-of-function of OsFBK16 in rice displayed enhanced blast resistance, indicating that OsFBK16 degrades OsPALs to negatively regulate rice immunity. The rice UbE3-ORFeome is the first complete E3 ligase library in plants and represents a powerful proteomic resource for rapid identification of the cognate E3 ligases of ubiquitinated proteins and establishment of functional E3-substrate interactome in plants.",ubiquitination essential many cellular process eukaryote including proteasomedependent protein degradation cell cycle progression transcriptional regulation signal transduction although numerous ubiquitinated protein empirically identified cognate ubiquitin e ligases remain largely unknown generate complete ubiquitin e ligaseencoding open reading frame ubeorfeome library containing e ligase gene rice oryza sativa l genome test screen four known ubiquitinated protein identify known new e interaction degradation several e substrate confirmed vitro vivo addition identify fbox e ligase osfbk hubinteracting protein phenylalanine ammonia lyase family ospalospal demonstrate osfbk promotes degradation ospal ospal ospal remarkably find overexpression ospal ospal well lossoffunction osfbk rice displayed enhanced blast resistance indicating osfbk degrades ospals negatively regulate rice immunity rice ubeorfeome first complete e ligase library plant represents powerful proteomic resource rapid identification cognate e ligases ubiquitinated protein establishment functional esubstrate interactome plant,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
37003467,Population structure of Pyricularia oryzae on rice in Vietnam reveals diversified populations with four pandemic and two endemic clusters.,"We characterized the genetic structure of 609 strains of Pyricularia oryzae, the fungal pathogen causing rice blast disease, in three main regions in Vietnam using microsatellites (SSR) markers. From the 447 distinct multilocus genotypes identified, six genetic clusters were defined, all of them showing elevated genetic and genotypic diversities. Four of these clusters were related to rice-attacking lineages already described at the worldwide scale, whereas the two remaining clusters were endemic to Vietnam. Strains were unevenly distributed into the six clusters depending on their groups of rice variety (indica / japonica) or type of varieties (traditional / modern) of origin, but none of the clusters was specifically related to these two factors. The highest diversity of blast population was found in Northern mountainous area, and the lowest in Red River Delta in both terms of genetic diversity and gene diversity. Hierarchical AMOVAs confirmed that all three factors considered (rice variety group, type of variety origin and geography) significantly contributed to the population structure of P. oryzae in Vietnam, with highest contribution from rice variety group. Mating types were unevenly distributed among clusters. Combined with results of female fertility and linkage disequilibirum, we hypothesized that clonal reproduction probably occurred in all clusters, but that sexual reproduction likely took place at least in some restricted areas in the Northern mountainous area for strains belonging to the cluster related to the previously described recombinant lineage (worldwide lineage 1). Our study pictures the genetic diversity, population structure and reproductive mode of the blast fungus in central and north Vietnam, and shows that the observed population structure is explained by several factors, the most important one being the variability of rice variety.

24684436,Multiple phytohormones and phytoalexins are involved in disease resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae invaded from roots in rice.,"Blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which leads to the biosynthesis of defense-related phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) and flavonoid-type phytoalexins sakuranetin and naringenin. However, the roles and biochemical features of individual rice PALs in defense responses to pathogens remain unclear. Here, we report that rice OsPAL06, which can catalyze the formation of trans-cinnamate using l-phenylalanine, is involved in rice root-M. oryzae interaction. OsPAL06-knockout mutant showed increased susceptibility to M. oryzae invaded from roots and developed typical leaf blast symptoms, accompanied by nearly complete disappearance of sakuranetin and naringenin and a two-third reduction of the SA level in roots. This mutant also showed compensatively induced expression of chalcone synthase, which is involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, isochorismate synthase 1, which is putatively involved in SA synthesis via another pathway, reduced jasmonate content and increased ethylene content. These results suggest that OsPAL06 is a positive regulator in preventing M. oryzae infection from roots. It may regulate defense by promoting both phytoalexin accumulation and SA signaling that synergistically and antagonistically interacts with jasmonate- and ethylene-dependent signaling, respectively.",blast caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating disease rice worldwide phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal key enzyme phenylpropanoid pathway lead biosynthesis defenserelated phytohormone salicylic acid sa flavonoidtype phytoalexins sakuranetin naringenin however role biochemical feature individual rice pal defense response pathogen remain unclear report rice ospal catalyze formation transcinnamate using lphenylalanine involved rice rootm oryzae interaction ospalknockout mutant showed increased susceptibility oryzae invaded root developed typical leaf blast symptom accompanied nearly complete disappearance sakuranetin naringenin twothird reduction sa level root mutant also showed compensatively induced expression chalcone synthase involved flavonoid biosynthesis isochorismate synthase putatively involved sa synthesis via another pathway reduced jasmonate content increased ethylene content result suggest ospal positive regulator preventing oryzae infection root may regulate defense promoting phytoalexin accumulation sa signaling synergistically antagonistically interacts jasmonate ethylenedependent signaling respectively,4,"{'Disease': ['fungus magnaporthe', 'one devastating disease rice worldwide phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal key enzyme'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['typical leaf blast symptom']}",11

38956897,Phosphatidylethanolamines link ferroptosis and autophagy during appressorium formation of rice blast fungus.,"A cell death pathway, ferroptosis, occurs in conidial cells and is critical for formation and function of the infection structure, the appressorium, in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. In this study, we identified an orthologous lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (Lpaat) acting at upstream of phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) biosynthesis and which is required for such fungal ferroptosis and pathogenicity. Two PE species, DOPE and SLPE, that depend on Lpaat function for production were sufficient for induction of lipid peroxidation and the consequent ferroptosis, thus positively regulating fungal pathogenicity. On the other hand, both DOPE and SLPE positively regulated autophagy. Loss of the LPAAT gene led to a decrease in the lipidated form of the autophagy protein Atg8, which is probably responsible for the autophagy defect of the lpaatΔ mutant. GFP-Lpaat was mostly localized on the membrane of lipid droplets (LDs) that were stained by the fluorescent dye monodansylpentane (MDH), suggesting that LDs serve as a source of lipids for membrane PE biosynthesis and probably as a membrane source of autophagosome.

ΔMokin1 mutant showed significant phenotypic defects and significantly reduced pathogenicity. However, the internal mechanism of how MoKin1 affected the development of physiology and biochemistry remained unclear in M. oryzae. This study adopted a multi-omics approach to comprehensively analyze MoKin1 function, and the results showed that MoKin1 affected the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Proteomic analysis revealed that the downregulated proteins in ΔMokin1 mutant were enriched mainly in the response to ER stress triggered by the unfolded protein. Loss of MoKin1 prevented the ER stress signal from reaching the nucleus. Therefore, the phosphorylation of various proteins regulating the transcription of ER stress-related genes and mRNA translation was significantly downregulated. The insensitivity to ER stress led to metabolic disorders, resulting in a significant shortage of carbohydrates and a low energy supply, which also resulted in severe phenotypic defects in ΔMokin1 mutant. Analysis of MoKin1-interacting proteins indicated that MoKin1 really took participate in the response to ER stress.

24871256,Comprehensive analysis of VQ motif-containing gene expression in rice defense responses to three pathogens.,"Expression levels of rice VQ motif-containing genes in response to pathogen infection vary among pathogens, and some of the genes are co-expressed with defense-response WRKY genes. Recent studies have revealed that some VQ (FxxxVQxLTG) motif-containing proteins in plants partner with WRKY transcription factors to participate in their functions. Accumulating information suggests that WRKY proteins play important roles in the response of rice plants to pathogen infection. However, the functions of rice VQ motif-containing proteins are unknown. To explore whether VQ motif-containing proteins are involved in defense against pathogens in rice, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of the genes for these proteins. The rice VQ motif-containing family consists of 40 genes, all of which encode proteins harboring a 21-amino acid VQ-containing motif, which in turn contains the known VQ motif. On the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific expression characteristics, we transcriptionally analyzed 13 representative genes in rice responses to three pathogens: Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes bacterial blight disease; X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, which causes bacterial streak disease; and Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes fungal blast disease. The expression of some of the genes changed markedly in response to infection by at least one of the pathogen species, and some of the genes also showed markedly different expression in resistant and susceptible reactions.

35311472,Alternative splicing diversifies the transcriptome and proteome of the rice blast fungus during host infection.,"Alternative splicing (AS) contributes to diversifying and regulating cellular responses to environmental conditions and developmental cues by differentially producing multiple mRNA and protein isoforms from a single gene. Previous studies on AS in pathogenic fungi focused on profiling AS isoforms under a limited number of conditions. We analysed AS profiles in the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, a global threat to rice production, using high-quality transcriptome data representing its vegetative growth (mycelia) and multiple host infection stages. We identified 4,270 AS isoforms derived from 2,413 genes, including 499 genes presumably regulated by infection-specific AS. AS appears to increase during infection, with 32.7% of the AS isoforms being produced during infection but absent in mycelia. Analysis of the isoforms observed at each infection stage showed that 636 AS isoforms were more abundant than corresponding annotated mRNAs, especially after initial hyphal penetration into host cell. Many such dominant isoforms were predicted to encode regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and phospho-transferases. We also identified the genes encoding distinct proteins via AS and confirmed the translation of some isoforms via a proteomic analysis, suggesting potential AS-mediated neo-functionalization of some genes during infection. Comprehensive profiling of the pattern of genome-wide AS during multiple stages of rice-<i>M. oryzae</i> interaction established a foundational resource that will help investigate the role and regulation of AS during rice infection.",alternative splicing contributes diversifying regulating cellular response environmental condition developmental cue differentially producing multiple mrna protein isoforms single gene previous study pathogenic fungi focused profiling isoforms limited number condition analysed profile rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei global threat rice production using highquality transcriptome data representing vegetative growth mycelium multiple host infection stage identified isoforms derived gene including gene presumably regulated infectionspecific appears increase infection isoforms produced infection absent mycelium analysis isoforms observed infection stage showed isoforms abundant corresponding annotated mrna especially initial hyphal penetration host cell many dominant isoforms predicted encode regulatory protein transcription factor phosphotransferases also identified gene encoding distinct protein via confirmed translation isoforms via proteomic analysis suggesting potential asmediated neofunctionalization gene infection comprehensive profiling pattern genomewide multiple stage riceim oryzaei interaction established foundational resource help investigate role regulation rice infection,7,"{'Disease': ['profile rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei global threat rice production'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
25007618,[Rice blast prediction model based on analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum].,"In order to detect rice blast more rapidly, accurately and nondestructively, the identification and early warning models of rice blast were established in the present research. First of all, rice blast was divided into three grades according to the relative area of disease spots in rice leaf and laser induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra of rice leaves at different disease levels were measured in the paddy fields. Meanwhile, 502-830 nm bands of laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra were selected for the study of rice blast. Savitzky-Golay(SG) smoothing and First Derivative Transform(FDT) were applied for the pretreatment of laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra. Then the method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to achieve the dimension reduction on spectral information, three principal components whose variance are greater than 1 and cumulative credibility is 99.924% were extracted by this method. Furthermore, the tentative data were divided into calibration set and validation set, the levels of rice blast were taken as the predictors. Combined with the calibration set which contains the disease and spectral information of 133 leaves, Discriminant Analysis (DA), Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis (MLRA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were used respectively to establish the identification and early warning models of rice blast. The Prediction examinations of the three models were made based on the validation set which contains the disease and spectral information of 89 leaves. The results show that all the models of PCA-DA, PCA-MLRA and PCA-MLP can carry on the prediction of rice blast, and the average prediction accuracy of PCA-MLP prediction model is 91.7% which is improved compared with PCA- DA and PCA- MLRA.",order detect rice blast rapidly accurately nondestructively identification early warning model rice blast established present research first rice blast divided three grade according relative area disease spot rice leaf laser induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum rice leaf different disease level measured paddy field meanwhile nm band laserinduced chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum selected study rice blast savitzkygolaysg smoothing first derivative transformfdt applied pretreatment laserinduced chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum method principal component analysis pca used achieve dimension reduction spectral information three principal component whose variance greater cumulative credibility extracted method furthermore tentative data divided calibration set validation set level rice blast taken predictor combined calibration set contains disease spectral information leaf discriminant analysis da multiple logistic regression analysis mlra multilayer perceptron mlp used respectively establish identification early warning model rice blast prediction examination three model made based validation set contains disease spectral information leaf result show model pcada pcamlra pcamlp carry prediction rice blast average prediction accuracy pcamlp prediction model improved compared pca da pca mlra,8,"{'Disease': ['relative area disease spot rice leaf laser', 'disease spectral information leaf discriminant analysis da multiple logistic regression analysis mlra multilayer perceptron mlp'], 'Treatment': ['first derivative transformfdt applied pretreatment', 'laserinduced chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum method principal component analysis', 'method'], 'Symptom': []}",2
25624395,The WRKY45-2 WRKY13 WRKY42 transcriptional regulatory cascade is required for rice resistance to fungal pathogen.,"Blast caused by fungal Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide, and this fungus also infects barley (Hordeum vulgare). At least 11 rice WRKY transcription factors have been reported to regulate rice response to M. oryzae either positively or negatively. However, the relationships of these WRKYs in the rice defense signaling pathway against M. oryzae are unknown. Previous studies have revealed that rice WRKY13 (as a transcriptional repressor) and WRKY45-2 enhance resistance to M. oryzae. Here, we show that rice WRKY42, functioning as a transcriptional repressor, suppresses resistance to M. oryzae. WRKY42-RNA interference (RNAi) and WRKY42-overexpressing (oe) plants showed increased resistance and susceptibility to M. oryzae, accompanied by increased or reduced jasmonic acid (JA) content, respectively, compared with wild-type plants. JA pretreatment enhanced the resistance of WRKY42-oe plants to M. oryzae. WRKY13 directly suppressed WRKY42. WRKY45-2, functioning as a transcriptional activator, directly activated WRKY13. In addition, WRKY13 directly suppressed WRKY45-2 by feedback regulation. The WRKY13-RNAi WRKY45-2-oe and WRKY13-oe WRKY42-oe double transgenic lines showed increased susceptibility to M. oryzae compared with WRKY45-2-oe and WRKY13-oe plants, respectively. These results suggest that the three WRKYs form a sequential transcriptional regulatory cascade. WRKY42 may negatively regulate rice response to M. oryzae by suppressing JA signaling-related genes, and WRKY45-2 transcriptionally activates WRKY13, whose encoding protein in turn transcriptionally suppresses WRKY42 to regulate rice resistance to M. oryzae.",blast caused fungal magnaporthe oryzae devastating disease rice oryza sativa worldwide fungus also infects barley hordeum vulgare least rice wrky transcription factor reported regulate rice response oryzae either positively negatively however relationship wrkys rice defense signaling pathway oryzae unknown previous study revealed rice wrky transcriptional repressor wrky enhance resistance oryzae show rice wrky functioning transcriptional repressor suppresses resistance oryzae wrkyrna interference rnai wrkyoverexpressing oe plant showed increased resistance susceptibility oryzae accompanied increased reduced jasmonic acid ja content respectively compared wildtype plant ja pretreatment enhanced resistance wrkyoe plant oryzae wrky directly suppressed wrky wrky functioning transcriptional activator directly activated wrky addition wrky directly suppressed wrky feedback regulation wrkyrnai wrkyoe wrkyoe wrkyoe double transgenic line showed increased susceptibility oryzae compared wrkyoe wrkyoe plant respectively result suggest three wrkys form sequential transcriptional regulatory cascade wrky may negatively regulate rice response oryzae suppressing ja signalingrelated gene wrky transcriptionally activates wrky whose encoding protein turn transcriptionally suppresses wrky regulate rice resistance oryzae,12,"{'Disease': ['fungal magnaporthe oryzae devastating disease rice oryza sativa worldwide fungus'], 'Treatment': ['wildtype plant ja pretreatment enhanced resistance wrkyoe plant oryzae wrky directly suppressed wrky wrky functioning transcriptional activator'], 'Symptom': []}",7

Here, we report that PA is an efficient apoptosis agent triggering cell death of hypersensitive-like response in planta. Confirmed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS), rice suspension cells and leaves exhibited programmed cell death induced by PA. The PA-induced cell death was associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that could be blocked by diphenylene iodonium chloride, indicating that the generation of reactive oxygen species was NADPH-oxidase dependent. We also demonstrated the induction of rice defense-related genes and subsequent resistant enhancement by PA against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. Hence, it was concluded that the PA-stimulated defense response likely involves the onset of the hypersensitive response in rice, which also provides a simple eliciting tool for studying apoptosis in the plant cell.",alphapicolinic acid pa metabolite tryptophan inducer apoptosis animal cell reported toxin produced plant fungal pathogen used screening disease resistant mutant report pa efficient apoptosis agent triggering cell death hypersensitivelike response planta confirmed fluorescence activated cell sorter facs rice suspension cell leaf exhibited programmed cell death induced pa painduced cell death associated accumulation reactive oxygen specie could blocked diphenylene iodonium chloride indicating generation reactive oxygen specie nadphoxidase dependent also demonstrated induction rice defenserelated gene subsequent resistant enhancement pa rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea hence concluded pastimulated defense response likely involves onset hypersensitive response rice also provides simple eliciting tool studying apoptosis plant cell,3,"{'Disease': ['screening disease resistant mutant report', 'pa rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
26574735,Dissection of the genetic architecture of rice resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Resistance in rice cultivars to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is complex and is controlled by both major genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the rice diversity panel 1 (RDP1) that was genotyped using a high-density (700 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms) array and inoculated with five diverse M. oryzae isolates. We identified 97 loci associated with blast resistance (LABRs). Among them, 82 were new regions and 15 co-localized with known blast resistance loci. The top 72 LABRs explained up to 98% of the phenotypic variation. The candidate genes in the LABRs encode nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance proteins, receptor-like protein kinases, transcription factors and defence-related proteins. Among them, LABR_64 was strongly associated with resistance to all five isolates. We analysed the function of candidate genes underlying LABR_64 using RNA interference (RNAi) technology and identified two new resistance alleles at the Pi5 locus.

38709339,Understanding the nature of blast resistance in combined bacterial leaf blight and blast gene pyramided lines of rice variety tellahamsa.,"Rice blast and bacterial leaf blight (BLB) are the most limiting factors for rice production in the world which cause yield losses typically ranging from 20 to 30% and can be as high as 50% in some areas of Asia especially India under severe infection conditions. An improved line of Tellahamsa, TH-625-491 having two BLB resistance genes (xa13 and Xa21) and two blast resistance genes (Pi54 and Pi1) with 95% Tellahamsa genome was used in the present study. TH-625-491 was validated for all four target genes and was used for backcrossing with Tellahamsa. Seventeen IBC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> plants heterozygous for all four target genes, 19 IBC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> plants homozygous for four, three and two gene combinations and 19 IBC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2:3</sub> plants also homozygous for four, three and two gene combinations were observed.

37975814,Intraspecific Variation of Transposable Elements Reveals Differences in the Evolutionary History of Fungal Phytopathogen Pathotypes.,"Transposable elements (TEs) contribute to intraspecific variation and play important roles in the evolution of fungal genomes. However, our understanding of the processes that shape TE landscapes is limited, as is our understanding of the relationship between TE content, population structure, and evolutionary history of fungal species. Fungal plant pathogens, which often have host-specific populations, are useful systems in which to study intraspecific TE content diversity. Here, we describe TE dynamics in five lineages of Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungus that causes blast disease of rice, wheat, and many other grasses. We identified differences in TE content across these lineages and showed that recent lineage-specific expansions of certain TEs have contributed to overall greater TE content in rice-infecting and Setaria-infecting lineages. We reconstructed the evolutionary histories of long terminal repeat-retrotransposon expansions and found that in some cases they were caused by complex proliferation dynamics of one element and in others by multiple elements from an older population of TEs multiplying in parallel. Additionally, we found evidence suggesting the recent transfer of a DNA transposon between rice- and wheat-infecting M. oryzae lineages and a region showing evidence of homologous recombination between those lineages, which could have facilitated such a transfer. By investigating intraspecific TE content variation, we uncovered key differences in the proliferation dynamics of TEs in various pathotypes of a fungal plant pathogen, giving us a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the pathogen itself.",transposable element te contribute intraspecific variation play important role evolution fungal genome however understanding process shape te landscape limited understanding relationship te content population structure evolutionary history fungal specie fungal plant pathogen often hostspecific population useful system study intraspecific te content diversity describe te dynamic five lineage magnaporthe oryzae fungus cause blast disease rice wheat many grass identified difference te content across lineage showed recent lineagespecific expansion certain te contributed overall greater te content riceinfecting setariainfecting lineage reconstructed evolutionary history long terminal repeatretrotransposon expansion found case caused complex proliferation dynamic one element others multiple element older population te multiplying parallel additionally found evidence suggesting recent transfer dna transposon rice wheatinfecting oryzae lineage region showing evidence homologous recombination lineage could facilitated transfer investigating intraspecific te content variation uncovered key difference proliferation dynamic te various pathotypes fungal plant pathogen giving u better understanding evolutionary history pathogen,9,"{'Disease': ['oryzae fungus cause'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
28165657,The role of glycerol in the pathogenic lifestyle of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae elaborates a specialized cell called an appressorium, which is used to breach the tough outer cuticle of a rice leaf, enabling the fungus entry to host plant cells. The appressorium generates enormous turgor by accumulating glycerol to very high concentrations within the cell. Glycerol accumulation and melanization of the appressorium cell wall collectively drive turgor-mediated penetration of the rice leaf. In this review, we discuss the potential metabolic sources of glycerol in the rice blast fungus and how appressorium turgor is focused as physical force at the base of the infection cell, leading to the formation of a rigid penetration peg. We review recent studies of M. oryzae and other relevant appressorium-forming fungi which shed light on how glycerol is synthesized and how appressorium turgor is regulated. Finally, we provide some questions to guide avenues of future research that will be important in fully understanding the role of glycerol in rice blast disease.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae elaborates specialized cell called appressorium used breach tough outer cuticle rice leaf enabling fungus entry host plant cell appressorium generates enormous turgor accumulating glycerol high concentration within cell glycerol accumulation melanization appressorium cell wall collectively drive turgormediated penetration rice leaf review discus potential metabolic source glycerol rice blast fungus appressorium turgor focused physical force base infection cell leading formation rigid penetration peg review recent study oryzae relevant appressoriumforming fungi shed light glycerol synthesized appressorium turgor regulated finally provide question guide avenue future research important fully understanding role glycerol rice blast disease,3,"{'Disease': ['specialized cell called appressorium used breach tough outer cuticle rice leaf enabling fungus entry host plant cell appressorium', 'potential metabolic source glycerol rice blast fungus appressorium turgor'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

Geostatistical analyses detected spatial dependence of blast incidence with influence ranges of 399 to 1,080 km at regional scale and 5 to 10 m at field scale but not at county scale.

37341444,Dynamics of spatial and temporal population structure of Pyricularia oryzae in Taiwan.,"To gain a better understanding of how Pyricularia oryzae population shifts is important for selecting suitable resistance genes for rice breeding programs. However, the relationships between P. oryzae pathogenic dynamics, geographic distribution, rice varieties, and timeline are not well studied. Resistance genes Piz-5, Pi9(t), Pi12(t), Pi20(t), Pita-2, and Pi11 showed stable resistance to the Taiwan rice blast fungus over 8 years of observations. Furthermore, 1749 rice blast isolates were collected from 2014 to 2021 and categorized into five pathotype clusters based on their correlation analysis between the geographic sources and virulence of Lijiangxintuanheigu monogenic lines. A detailed map of their distributions in Taiwan is presented. Isolates collected from the western region of Taiwan had greater pathotype diversity than those from the east region. Isolates collected from the subtropical region had greater diversity than those from the tropical region. Rice cultivars carrying Pik alleles were highly susceptible to pathotype L4. Cultivars with Piz-t were highly susceptible to pathotype L5, and those with Pish were highly susceptible to pathotype L1. The geographical distribution of each pathotype was distinct, and the population size of each pathotype fluctuated significantly each year. The regional mega cultivars significantly impact the evolution of Pyricularia oryzae in Taiwan within the span of 8 years. However, the annual fluctuation of pathotype populations likely correlate to the rising annual temperatures that selected pathotype clusters by their optimal growth temperature.

36173975,Rice apoplastic CBM1-interacting protein counters blast pathogen invasion by binding conserved carbohydrate binding module 1 motif of fungal proteins.,"When infecting plants, fungal pathogens secrete cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) that break down cellulose and hemicellulose, the primary components of plant cell walls. Some fungal CWDEs contain a unique domain, named the carbohydrate binding module (CBM), that facilitates their access to polysaccharides. However, little is known about how plants counteract pathogen degradation of their cell walls. Here, we show that the rice cysteine-rich repeat secretion protein OsRMC binds to and inhibits xylanase MoCel10A of the blast fungus pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, interfering with its access to the rice cell wall and degradation of rice xylan. We found binding of OsRMC to various CBM1-containing enzymes, suggesting that it has a general role in inhibiting the action of CBM1. OsRMC is localized to the apoplast, and its expression is strongly induced in leaves infected with M. oryzae. Remarkably, knockdown and overexpression of OsRMC reduced and enhanced rice defense against M. oryzae, respectively, demonstrating that inhibition of CBM1-containing fungal enzymes by OsRMC is crucial for rice defense. We also identified additional CBM-interacting proteins (CBMIPs) from Arabidopsis thaliana and Setaria italica, indicating that a wide range of plants counteract pathogens through this mechanism.",infecting plant fungal pathogen secrete cell walldegrading enzyme cwdes break cellulose hemicellulose primary component plant cell wall fungal cwdes contain unique domain named carbohydrate binding module cbm facilitates access polysaccharide however little known plant counteract pathogen degradation cell wall show rice cysteinerich repeat secretion protein osrmc bind inhibits xylanase mocela blast fungus pathogen magnaporthe oryzae interfering access rice cell wall degradation rice xylan found binding osrmc various cbmcontaining enzyme suggesting general role inhibiting action cbm osrmc localized apoplast expression strongly induced leaf infected oryzae remarkably knockdown overexpression osrmc reduced enhanced rice defense oryzae respectively demonstrating inhibition cbmcontaining fungal enzyme osrmc crucial rice defense also identified additional cbminteracting protein cbmips arabidopsis thaliana setaria italica indicating wide range plant counteract pathogen mechanism,3,"{'Disease': ['however little known plant counteract pathogen degradation cell wall show rice cysteinerich repeat secretion protein osrmc bind inhibits xylanase mocela blast fungus pathogen'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
21051443,Pdk1 kinase regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice.,"The AGC kinase OsOxi1, which has been isolated as an interactor with OsPti1a, positively regulates basal disease resistance in rice. In eukaryotes, AGC kinase family proteins are regulated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1). In Arabidopsis, AtPdk1 directly interacts with phosphatidic acid, which functions as a second messenger in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, the functions of Pdk1 are poorly understood in plants. We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-OsPti1a signal cascade in disease resistance in rice. OsPdk1 interacts with OsOxi1 and phosphorylates the Ser283 residue of OsOxi1 in vitro. To investigate whether OsPdk1 is involved in immunity that is triggered by microbial-associated molecular patterns, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of OsPdk1 in response to chitin elicitor. Like OsOxi1, OsPdk1 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to chitin elicitor, suggesting that OsPdk1 participates in signal transduction through pathogen recognition. The overexpression of OsPdk1 enhanced basal resistance against a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, and a bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-OsPti1a phosphorylation cascade in rice.",agc kinase osoxi isolated interactor osptia positively regulates basal disease resistance rice eukaryote agc kinase family protein regulated phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase pdk arabidopsis atpdk directly interacts phosphatidic acid function second messenger biotic abiotic stress response however function pdk poorly understood plant show ospdk act upstream osoxiosptia signal cascade disease resistance rice ospdk interacts osoxi phosphorylates ser residue osoxi vitro investigate whether ospdk involved immunity triggered microbialassociated molecular pattern analyzed phosphorylation status ospdk response chitin elicitor like osoxi ospdk rapidly phosphorylated response chitin elicitor suggesting ospdk participates signal transduction pathogen recognition overexpression ospdk enhanced basal resistance blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo taken together result suggest ospdk positively regulates basal disease resistance osoxiosptia phosphorylation cascade rice,0,"{'Disease': ['basal disease resistance rice eukaryote agc kinase family protein regulated phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase pdk arabidopsis', 'transduction pathogen recognition overexpression ospdk enhanced basal resistance blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae', 'basal disease resistance osoxiosptia phosphorylation cascade rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
14730444,Genome-wide analysis of defense-responsive genes in bacterial blight resistance of rice mediated by the recessive R gene xa13.,"Defense responses triggered by dominant and recessive disease resistance (R) genes are presumed to be regulated by different molecular mechanisms. In order to characterize the genes activated in defense responses against bacterial blight mediated by the recessive R gene xa13, two pathogen-induced subtraction cDNA libraries were constructed using the resistant rice line IRBB13--which carries xa13--and its susceptible, near-isogenic, parental line IR24. Clustering analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) identified 702 unique expressed sequences as being involved in the defense responses triggered by xa13; 16% of these are new rice ESTs. These sequences define 702 genes, putatively encoding a wide range of products, including defense-responsive genes commonly involved in different host-pathogen interactions, genes that have not previously been reported to be associated with pathogen-induced defense responses, and genes (38%) with no homology to previously described functional genes. In addition, R-like genes putatively encoding nucleotide-binding site/leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) and LRR receptor kinase proteins were observed to be induced in the disease resistance activated by xa13. A total of 568 defense-responsive ESTs were mapped to 588 loci on the rice molecular linkage map through bioinformatic analysis.

34758051,A single amino acid polymorphism in a conserved effector of the multihost blast fungus pathogen expands host-target binding spectrum.,"Accelerated gene evolution is a hallmark of pathogen adaptation and specialization following host-jumps. However, the molecular processes associated with adaptive evolution between host-specific lineages of a multihost plant pathogen remain poorly understood. In the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (Syn. Pyricularia oryzae), host specialization on different grass hosts is generally associated with dynamic patterns of gain and loss of virulence effector genes that tend to define the distinct genetic lineages of this pathogen. Here, we unravelled the biochemical and structural basis of adaptive evolution of APikL2, an exceptionally conserved paralog of the well-studied rice-lineage specific effector AVR-Pik. Whereas AVR-Pik and other members of the six-gene AVR-Pik family show specific patterns of presence/absence polymorphisms between grass-specific lineages of M. oryzae, APikL2 stands out by being ubiquitously present in all blast fungus lineages from 13 different host species. Using biochemical, biophysical and structural biology methods, we show that a single aspartate to asparagine polymorphism expands the binding spectrum of APikL2 to host proteins of the heavy-metal associated (HMA) domain family. This mutation maps to one of the APikL2-HMA binding interfaces and contributes to an altered hydrogen-bonding network. By combining phylogenetic ancestral reconstruction with an analysis of the structural consequences of allelic diversification, we revealed a common mechanism of effector specialization in the AVR-Pik/APikL2 family that involves two major HMA-binding interfaces. Together, our findings provide a detailed molecular evolution and structural biology framework for diversification and adaptation of a fungal pathogen effector family following host-jumps.",accelerated gene evolution hallmark pathogen adaptation specialization following hostjumps however molecular process associated adaptive evolution hostspecific lineage multihost plant pathogen remain poorly understood blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae syn pyricularia oryzae host specialization different grass host generally associated dynamic pattern gain loss virulence effector gene tend define distinct genetic lineage pathogen unravelled biochemical structural basis adaptive evolution apikl exceptionally conserved paralog wellstudied ricelineage specific effector avrpik whereas avrpik member sixgene avrpik family show specific pattern presenceabsence polymorphism grassspecific lineage oryzae apikl stand ubiquitously present blast fungus lineage different host specie using biochemical biophysical structural biology method show single aspartate asparagine polymorphism expands binding spectrum apikl host protein heavymetal associated hma domain family mutation map one apiklhma binding interface contributes altered hydrogenbonding network combining phylogenetic ancestral reconstruction analysis structural consequence allelic diversification revealed common mechanism effector specialization avrpikapikl family involves two major hmabinding interface together finding provide detailed molecular evolution structural biology framework diversification adaptation fungal pathogen effector family following hostjumps,13,"{'Disease': ['poorly understood blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae syn pyricularia oryzae host specialization different grass host', 'ubiquitously present blast fungus lineage different host specie'], 'Treatment': ['biochemical biophysical structural biology method'], 'Symptom': ['loss virulence effector gene', 'ricelineage specific effector avrpik', 'common mechanism effector specialization avrpikapikl family', 'detailed molecular evolution structural biology framework diversification adaptation fungal pathogen effector family']}",5

Members of the Magnaporthe grisea species complex cause blast disease on a wide range of gramineous hosts, including cultivated rice and other grass species. Recently, based on phylogenetic analyses and mating tests, isolates from crabgrass were separated from the species complex and named M. grisea. Then other isolates from grasses including rice were named as M. oryzae. Here, we collected 103 isolates from 11 different species of grasses in Korea and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships and pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analyses of multilocus sequences and DNA fingerprinting revealed that the haplotypes of most isolates were associated with their hosts. However, six isolates had different haplotypes from the expectation, suggesting potential host shift in nature. Results of pathogenicity tests demonstrated that 42 isolates from crabgrass and 19 isolates from rice and other grasses showed cross-infectivity on rice and crabgrass, respectively.

39180241,Vacuolar recruitment of retromer by a SNARE complex enables infection-related trafficking in rice blast.,"The retromer complex is a conserved sorting machinery that maintains cellular protein homeostasis by transporting vesicles containing cargo proteins to defined destinations. It is known to sort proteins at the vacuole membranes for retrograde trafficking, preventing their degradation in the vacuole. However, the detailed mechanism of retromer recruitment to the vacuole membrane has not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that the vacuolar SNARE complex MoPep12-MoVti1-MoVam7-MoYkt6 regulates retromer-mediated vesicle trafficking by recruiting the retromer to the vacuole membrane, which promotes host invasion in Magnaporthe oryzae. Such recruitment is also essential for the retrieval of the autophagy regulator MoAtg8 and enables appressorium-mediated host penetration. Furthermore, the vacuolar SNARE subunits are involved in suppressing the host defense response by regulating the deployment of retromer-MoSnc1-mediated effector secretion. Altogether, our results provide insights into the mechanism of vacuolar SNAREs-dependent retromer recruitment which is necessary for pathogenicity-related membrane trafficking events in the rice blast fungus.",retromer complex conserved sorting machinery maintains cellular protein homeostasis transporting vesicle containing cargo protein defined destination known sort protein vacuole membrane retrograde trafficking preventing degradation vacuole however detailed mechanism retromer recruitment vacuole membrane yet elucidated show vacuolar snare complex mopepmovtimovammoykt regulates retromermediated vesicle trafficking recruiting retromer vacuole membrane promotes host invasion magnaporthe oryzae recruitment also essential retrieval autophagy regulator moatg enables appressoriummediated host penetration furthermore vacuolar snare subunit involved suppressing host defense response regulating deployment retromermosncmediated effector secretion altogether result provide insight mechanism vacuolar snaresdependent retromer recruitment necessary pathogenicityrelated membrane trafficking event rice blast fungus,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['deployment retromermosncmediated effector secretion']}",6

A semi-dominant lesion mimic mutant als1 (apoptosis leaf and sheath 1) in rice was identified to demonstrate spontaneous lesions on the leaf blade and sheath. A map-based cloning strategy was used for fine mapping and cloning of ALS1, which was confirmed to be a typical CRK in rice. Functional studies of ALS1 were conducted, including phylogenetic analysis, expression analysis, subcellular location and blast resistance identification. Most pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and other defence-related genes were activated and up-regulated to a high degree. ALS1 was expressed mainly in the leaf blade and sheath, in which further study revealed that ALS1 was present in the vascular bundles. ALS1 was located in the cell membrane of rice protoplasts, and its mutation did not change its subcellular location. Jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation were observed in als1, and enhanced blast resistance was also observed.

Therefore, selecting and breeding new disease resistance and drought tolerance in rice is essential to ensure national food security. The utilization of heterosis has significantly enhanced rice productivity, yet many of the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unexplored. 'Nei 6 You 7075' ('N6Y7075') is a novel hybrid rice cultivar with exceptional quality, developed through the crossbreeding of 'Fuhui 7075' ('FH7075') and 'Neixiang 6 A' ('NX6A'). However, the precise mechanisms underlying the disease resistance and drought tolerance in 'N6Y7075' are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the resistance of hybrid rice 'N6Y7075' to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae), and drought and identified differentially expressed genes between hybrid rice 'N6Y7075' and its parents through RNA-seq analysis. Our research found that the hybrid 'N6Y7075' and its female parent 'NX6A' were less susceptible to bacterial blight and rice blast than the male parent 'FH7075', while 'FH7075' showed better drought tolerance than 'NX6A'. The hybrid 'N6Y7075' exhibited heterosis. Clustering results revealed that the expression profiles of the F1 hybrid closely resembled those of its parental lines rather than exhibiting an intermediate profile between the two parental lines. The disease resistance of hybrid rice 'N6Y7075' may be attributed to the plant-pathogen interaction pathways involving Xa21, CDPK, and RPM1-mediated hypersensitive response and WRKY1-induced defense-related gene expression and programmed cell death. The MAPK signaling pathway PR1 could also be associated with plant defense responses. Hybrid rice 'N6Y7075' may enhance drought tolerance by regulating MAPKKK17 and WAK60 in the MAPK signaling pathway. These proteins affect ABA stress adaptation and stomatal development in plants, respectively.

We also investigated the roles of these genes in disease resistance by testing single Rac/Rop-RNAi (RNA interference) plants against the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea. Our studies show that expression of OsRac2, 6 and 7 is very low in leaf blades, and reveal a strong correlation between the number of lysine and/or arginine (KR) residues in the polybasic region of Rac/Rop GTPases and their subcellular distribution in vivo.

BV6, that is isolated from rice roots and its biocontrol potential against rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. We evaluated the ability to isolate BV6 in the biological control of rice blast disease and investigated its antifungal mechanisms. BV6 strongly inhibited the hyphal growth of M. oryzae Guy11 and other plant pathogenic fungi, and pot experiments showed that BV6 significantly decreases the disease index of rice blast from 47.5 to 24.6. The secreted small-molecule secondary metabolites were regarded as weapons during the antifungal process by inhibiting the germination of M. oryzae conidia and mycelial growth, and thereby prevent the following infection. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the metabolites from the supernatant of isolate BV6 showed that the antifungal weapons of isolate BV6 are novel, small, molecular hydrophilic compounds that are different from reported antifungal compounds.

20146797,Identification and analysis of in planta expressed genes of Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Infection of plants by pathogens and the subsequent disease development involves substantial changes in the biochemistry and physiology of both partners. Analysis of genes that are expressed during these interactions represents a powerful strategy to obtain insights into the molecular events underlying these changes. We have employed expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis to identify rice genes involved in defense responses against infection by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and fungal genes involved in infectious growth within the host during a compatible interaction. A cDNA library was constructed with RNA from rice leaves (Oryza sativa cv. Hwacheong) infected with M. oryzae strain KJ201. To enrich for fungal genes, subtraction library using PCR-based suppression subtractive hybridization was constructed with RNA from infected rice leaves as a tester and that from uninfected rice leaves as the driver. A total of 4,148 clones from two libraries were sequenced to generate 2,302 non-redundant ESTs. Of these, 712 and 1,562 ESTs could be identified to encode fungal and rice genes, respectively. To predict gene function, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was applied, with 31% and 32% of rice and fungal ESTs being assigned to GO terms, respectively. One hundred uniESTs were found to be specific to fungal infection EST. More than 80 full-length fungal cDNA sequences were used to validate ab initio annotated gene model of M. oryzae genome sequence.

Pha was isolated saprophytically from the rice phylloplane and studied for its interaction with Mo in the defense process of upland rice plants against the pathogen attack. Investigating the Pha × Mo interaction in a completely randomized design, the suppression of leaf blast and the epidemiological components of disease development were quantified in vivo, whereas the physiological and biochemical aspects, as defense enzymes and oxidative complex components, were evaluated in vitro during the induction of resistance. In the Pha × Mo interaction, it was found that seed treatment can significantly reduce disease severity by up to 93%, increase the photosynthetic apparatus, mobilize photoassimilates to the defense system, intensify defense enzyme and oxidant complex activities (chitinase [CHI], β-1,3-glucanase [GLU], lipoxygenase [LOX], phenylalanine ammonia-lyase [PAL], poliphenoloxidase [PPO], peroxidase [POX], catalase [CAT], cuperoxide dismutase [SOD]), decrease phenolic compounds (TPCs), and increase photosynthetic pigment levels compared with the negative control (Mo).

On the basis of the annotations of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Arabidopsis genomic sequences and using the bio-software SignalP3.0, TMHMM2.0, TargetP1.1, and big-Pi Predictor, 25 out of 37 and 16 out of 24 open reading frames (ORFs) with chitinase activity from rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, were predicted to have signal peptides (SPs), which have an average of 24.8 amino acids at the N-terminal region. Some of the chitinases were secreted extracellularly, whereas some were located in the vacuole. The phylogenic relationship was analyzed with 61 ORFs and 25 known chitinases and they were classified into 6 clusters using Clustal X and MEGA3.1. This classification is not completely consistent when compared with the traditional system that classifies the chitinases into 7 classes.

Blast integrate management (BIM) requires the use of genetic resistance, cultural practices, and chemical control, although for sustainable BIM, the insertion of biological agents may be the fourth component for. The objective of this work was to test three formulations of Burkholderia pyrrocinia (BRM32113) previously selected and to verify the effectiveness in resistance induction and blast control in rice. Two experiments were carried out, in a completely randomized design with three replications, in the greenhouse (E1 and E2). E1 aimed to select the best treatment for suppressing leaf blast severity and activating plant defense mechanisms. It was composed of 8 treatments: (1) formulated 11+ B. pyrrocina × Magnaporthe oryzae; (2) formulated 17+ B. pyrrocina × M. oryzae; (3) formulated 32+ B. pyrrocina × M. oryzae; (4) formulated 11 × M. oryzae; (5) B. pyrrocinia 17 × M. oryzae; (6) formulated 32 × M. oryzae; (7) B. pyrrocina × M. oryzae; (8) M. oryzae; (9) control (water). E2 aimed to investigate the effect of the best treatments, for the promotion of plant growth and suppression of leaf blast by calculating AUDPC. It was composed of 6 treatments: (1) formulated 11+ B. pyrrocina × M. oryzae; (2) formulated 32+ B. pyrrocina × M. oryzae; (3) formulated 11 × M. oryzae; (4) formulated 32 × M. oryzae; (5) B. pyrrocina × M. oryzae; (6) water. And after, we did two assays aimed to localize this biological agent after application at seed, soil, and rice plant. In E1, formulated 11+ B. pyrrocinia and 32+ formulated and B. pyrrocina were the best, suppressing leaf blast by up to 97% and providing the significant increase of the enzymes β-1,3-glucanase, chitinase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, lipoxygenase, and salicylic acid at 24 h and 48 h after inoculation with M. oryzae. In E2, treatments formulated 11+ B. pyrrocinia, formulated 32+ B. pyrrocinia, and B. pyrrocina provided more significant increases in growth promotion and reduced area under disease progress curve. B. pyrrocinia was detected in the rice plant for 18 days, predominantly in the root system (internal and external). The use of B. pyrrocinia formulations based on sugarcane molasses and glycerol can be an essential strategy for sustainable management.

29356349,Rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.,"Breeding for disease resistance is the most effective strategy to control diseases, particularly with broad-spectrum disease resistance in many crops. However, knowledge on genes and mechanism of broad-spectrum resistance and trade-off between defence and growth in crops is limited. Here, we show that the rice copine genes OsBON1 and OsBON3 are critical suppressors of immunity. Both OsBON1 and OsBON3 changed their protein subcellular localization upon pathogen challenge. Knockdown of OsBON1 and dominant negative mutant of OsBON3 each enhanced resistance to rice bacterial and fungal pathogens with either hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic lifestyles. The defence activation in OsBON1 knockdown mutants was associated with reduced growth, both of which were largely suppressed under high temperature. In contrast, overexpression of OsBON1 or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth. However, neither OsBON1 nor OsBON3 could rescue the dwarf phenotype of the Arabidopsis BON1 knockout mutant, suggesting a divergence of the rice and Arabidopsis copine genes. Our study therefore shows that the rice copine genes play a negative role in regulating disease resistance and their expression level and protein location likely have a large impact on the balance between immunity and agronomic traits.",breeding disease resistance effective strategy control disease particularly broadspectrum disease resistance many crop however knowledge gene mechanism broadspectrum resistance tradeoff defence growth crop limited show rice copine gene osbon osbon critical suppressor immunity osbon osbon changed protein subcellular localization upon pathogen challenge knockdown osbon dominant negative mutant osbon enhanced resistance rice bacterial fungal pathogen either hemibiotrophic necrotrophic lifestyle defence activation osbon knockdown mutant associated reduced growth largely suppressed high temperature contrast overexpression osbon osbon decreased disease resistance promoted plant growth however neither osbon osbon could rescue dwarf phenotype arabidopsis bon knockout mutant suggesting divergence rice arabidopsis copine gene study therefore show rice copine gene play negative role regulating disease resistance expression level protein location likely large impact balance immunity agronomic trait,8,"{'Disease': ['breeding disease resistance effective strategy control disease', 'particularly broadspectrum disease resistance', 'high temperature contrast overexpression osbon osbon decreased disease resistance', 'negative role regulating disease resistance expression level protein location'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['breeding disease resistance effective strategy control disease']}",10
24896089,Function and interaction of the coupled genes responsible for Pik-h encoded rice blast resistance.,"Pik-h, an allele of Pik, confers resistance against the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.

While Pikh-1 appears to be constitutively transcribed, the transcript abundance of Pikh-2 responds to pathogen challenge. The Pikh-1 CC (coiled coil) domain interacts directly with both AvrPik-h and Pikh-2. Transient expression assays demonstrated that Pikh-2 mediates the initiation of the host defence response. Nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of both Pikh-1 and Pikh-2 is required for their functionalities. In a proposed mechanistic model of Pik-h resistance, it is suggested that Pikh-1 acts as an adaptor between AvrPik-h and Pikh-2, while Pikh-2 transduces the signal to trigger Pik-h-specific resistance.",pikh allele pik confers resistance rice blast pathogen magnaporthe oryzae positional cloning shown comprises pair nbslrr gene pikh pikh pikh appears constitutively transcribed transcript abundance pikh responds pathogen challenge pikh cc coiled coil domain interacts directly avrpikh pikh transient expression assay demonstrated pikh mediates initiation host defence response nucleocytoplasmic partitioning pikh pikh required functionality proposed mechanistic model pikh resistance suggested pikh act adaptor avrpikh pikh pikh transduces signal trigger pikhspecific resistance,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

31660870,Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of blast resistant and susceptible rice cultivars in response to salicylic acid.,"Salicylic acid (SA) is a significant signaling molecule that induces rice resistance against pathogen invasion.

In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment. Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination. Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars.

Its biotrophic invasive hyphae (IH) are enclosed in the extrainvasive hyphal membrane produced by plant cells, thus generating a front line of the battlefield between the pathogen and the host plants. In plants, defense-related complexes such as proteins, callose-rich materials and vesicles, are directionally secreted to this interface to confer defense responses, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we found that a Myosin gene, Myosin A1 (OsMYA1), contributed to rice defense. The OsMYA1 knockout mutant exhibited decreased resistance to M. oryzae infection. OsMYA1 localizes to the actin cytoskeleton and surrounds the IH of M. oryzae. OsMYA1 interacts with an exocyst subunit, OsExo70H1, and regulates its accumulation at the plasma membrane (PM) and pathogen-plant interface. Furthermore, OsExo70H1 interacted with the rice syntaxin of the plants121 protein (OsSyp121), and the distribution of OsSyp121 to the PM or the pathogen-plant interface was disrupted in both the OsMYA1 and OsExo70H1 mutants.

The resistance to BLS in rice is a quantitatively inherited trait, of which the molecular mechanism is still unclear. It has been proved that xa5, a recessive bacterial blast resistance gene, is the most possible candidate gene of the QTL qBlsr5a for BLS resistance. To study the molecular mechanism of xa5 function in BLS resistance, we created transgenic lines with RNAi of Xa5 (LOC_Os05g01710) and used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of a Xa5-RNAi line and the wild-type line at 9 h after inoculation with Xoc, with the mock inoculation as control. We found that Xa5-RNAi could (1) increase the resistance to BLS as expected from xa5; (2) alter (mainly up-regulate) the expression of hundreds of genes, most of which were related to disease resistance; and (3) greatly enhance the response of thousands of genes to Xoc infection, especially of the genes involved in cell death pathways. The results suggest that xa5 is the cause of BLS-resistance of QTL qBlsr5a and it displays BLS resistance effect probably mainly because of the enhanced response of the cell death-related genes to Xoc infection.",bacterial leaf steak bls caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola xoc devastating disease rice production resistance bls rice quantitatively inherited trait molecular mechanism still unclear proved xa recessive bacterial blast resistance gene possible candidate gene qtl qblsra bls resistance study molecular mechanism xa function bls resistance created transgenic line rnai xa locosg used rnaseq analyze transcriptomes xarnai line wildtype line h inoculation xoc mock inoculation control found xarnai could increase resistance bls expected xa alter mainly upregulate expression hundred gene related disease resistance greatly enhance response thousand gene xoc infection especially gene involved cell death pathway result suggest xa cause blsresistance qtl qblsra display bls resistance effect probably mainly enhanced response cell deathrelated gene xoc infection,5,"{'Disease': ['mainly upregulate expression hundred gene related disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['bls resistance effect']}",13
36980991,"Marker Assisted Introgression of Resistance Genes and Phenotypic Evaluation Enabled Identification of Durable and Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance in Elite Rice Cultivar, CO 51.","Across the globe, rice cultivation is seriously affected by blast disease, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. This disease has caused heavy yield loss to farmers over the past few years. In this background, the most affordable and eco-friendly strategy is to introgress blast-resistant genes from donors into elite rice cultivars. However, it is not only challenging to evolve such resistance lines using conventional breeding approaches, but also a time-consuming process. Therefore, the marker-assisted introduction of resistance genes has been proposed as a rapid strategy to develop durable and broad-spectrum resistance in rice cultivars. The current study highlights the successful introgression of a blast resistance gene, i.e., <i>Pi9</i>, into CO 51, an elite rice cultivar which already has another resistance gene named <i>Pi54</i>. The presence of two blast resistance genes in the advanced backcross breeding materials (BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2:3</sub>) was confirmed in this study through a foreground selection method using functional markers such as NBS4 and Pi54MAS. The selected positive introgressed lines were further genotyped for background selection with 55 SSR markers that are specific to CO 51. Consequently, both <i>Pi9</i> as well as <i>Pi54</i> pyramided lines, with 82.7% to 88.1% of the recurrent parent genome recovery, were identified and the selected lines were evaluated under hotspot. The analysis outcomes found that both the lines possessed a high level of resistance against blast disease during the seedling stage itself.

21171893,Identification and characterization of 2'-deoxyuridine from the supernatant of conidial suspensions of rice blast fungus as an infection-promoting factor in rice plants.,"We previously detected infection-promoting activity in the supernatant of the conidial suspension (SCS) of the rice blast fungus. In the present study, a molecule carrying the activity was purified and identified as 2'-deoxyuridine (dU). The infection-promoting activity of dU was strictly dependent on its chemical structure and displayed characteristics consistent with those of the SCS. Notably, the activity of dU was exclusively detected during interactions between rice and virulent isolates of the fungus, the number of susceptible lesions in leaf blades was increased by dU, and nonhost resistance in rice plants was not affected by treatment with dU. In addition, the expression of pathogensis-related genes, accumulation of H(2)O(2), and production of phytoalexins in rice in response to inoculation with virulent fungal isolates was not suppressed by dU. The infection-promoting activity of dU was not accompanied by elevated levels of endogenous abscissic acid, which is known to modify plant-pathogen interactions, and was not detected in interactions between oat plants and a virulent oat blast fungus isolate. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dU is a novel infection-promoting factor that acts specifically during compatible interactions between rice plants and rice blast fungus in a mode distinct from that of toxins and suppressors.",previously detected infectionpromoting activity supernatant conidial suspension sc rice blast fungus present study molecule carrying activity purified identified deoxyuridine du infectionpromoting activity du strictly dependent chemical structure displayed characteristic consistent sc notably activity du exclusively detected interaction rice virulent isolates fungus number susceptible lesion leaf blade increased du nonhost resistance rice plant affected treatment du addition expression pathogensisrelated gene accumulation ho production phytoalexins rice response inoculation virulent fungal isolates suppressed du infectionpromoting activity du accompanied elevated level endogenous abscissic acid known modify plantpathogen interaction detected interaction oat plant virulent oat blast fungus isolate taken together result demonstrate du novel infectionpromoting factor act specifically compatible interaction rice plant rice blast fungus mode distinct toxin suppressor,4,"{'Disease': ['infectionpromoting activity supernatant conidial suspension sc rice blast fungus present study molecule carrying activity', 'fungus number susceptible lesion leaf blade', 'interaction oat plant virulent oat blast fungus isolate', 'du novel infectionpromoting factor act specifically compatible interaction rice plant rice blast fungus mode distinct toxin suppressor'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
16528562,A comprehensive expression analysis of the WRKY gene superfamily in rice plants during defense response.,"To understand the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of host genes during the activation of defense responses in rice, we isolated WRKY transcription factors whose expressions were altered upon attack of the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of the devastating rice blast disease. A systematic expression analysis of OsWRKYs (Oryza sativa L. WRKYs) revealed that among 45 tested genes the expression of 15 genes was increased remarkably in an incompatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Twelve of the M. grisea-inducible OsWRKY genes were also differentially regulated in rice plants infected with the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). In experiments with defense signaling molecules, the expression of two genes, OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY62, was increased in salicylic acid (SA)-treated leaves and the expression of three genes, OsWRKY10, OsWRKY82, and OsWRKY85 was increased by jasmonic acid (JA) treatment.

34236673,"The Impact of Blast Disease: Past, Present, and Future.","Rice blast disease is both the most explosive and potentially damaging disease of the world's rice (Oryza sativa) crop and a model system for research on the molecular mechanisms that fungi use to cause plant disease. The blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is highly evolved to sense when it is on a leaf surface; to develop a pressurized cell, the appressorium, to punch through the leaf cuticle; and then to hijack living rice cells to assist it in causing disease. Host specificity, determining which plants particular fungal strains can infect, is also an important topic for research. The blast fungus is a moving target, quickly overcoming rice resistance genes we deploy to control it, and recently emerging to cause devastating disease on an entirely new cereal crop, wheat. M. oryzae is highly adaptable, with multiple examples of genetic instability at certain gene loci and in certain genomic regions. Understanding the biology of the fungus in the field, and its potential for genetic and genome variability, is key to keep it from adapting to life in the research laboratory and losing relevance to the significant impact it has on global food security.",rice blast disease explosive potentially damaging disease world rice oryza sativa crop model system research molecular mechanism fungi use cause plant disease blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae highly evolved sense leaf surface develop pressurized cell appressorium punch leaf cuticle hijack living rice cell assist causing disease host specificity determining plant particular fungal strain infect also important topic research blast fungus moving target quickly overcoming rice resistance gene deploy control recently emerging cause devastating disease entirely new cereal crop wheat oryzae highly adaptable multiple example genetic instability certain gene locus certain genomic region understanding biology fungus field potential genetic genome variability key keep adapting life research laboratory losing relevance significant impact global food security,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'potentially damaging disease world rice oryza sativa crop model system research molecular mechanism fungi use cause plant disease blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'disease host specificity', 'also important topic research blast fungus moving target', 'recently emerging cause devastating disease', 'biology fungus field'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['relevance significant impact global food security']}",9
19825558,Altered disease development in the eui mutants and Eui overexpressors indicates that gibberellins negatively regulate rice basal disease resistance.,"Gibberellins (GAs) form a group of important plant tetracyclic diterpenoid hormones that are involved in many aspects of plant growth and development. Emerging evidence implicates that GAs also play roles in stress responses. However, the role of GAs in biotic stress is largely unknown. Here, we report that knockout or overexpression of the Elongated uppermost internode (Eui) gene encoding a GA deactivating enzyme compromises or increases, respectively, disease resistance to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oyrzae) and rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae). Exogenous application of GA(3) and the inhibitor of GA synthesis (uniconazol) could increase disease susceptibility and resistance, respectively, to bacterial blight. Similarly, uniconazol restored disease resistance of the eui mutant and GA(3) decreased disease resistance of the Eui overexpressors to bacterial blight. Therefore, the change of resistance attributes to GA levels. In consistency with this, the GA metabolism genes OsGA20ox2 and OsGA2ox1 were down-regulated during pathogen challenge. We also found that PR1a induction was enhanced but the SA level was decreased in the Eui overexpressor, while the JA level was reduced in the eui mutant.

28128411,Genetic analysis and identification of SSR markers associated with rice blast disease in a BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> backcross population.,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) blast disease is one of the most destructive rice diseases in the world. The fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae, is the causal agent of rice blast disease. Development of resistant cultivars is the most preferred method to achieve sustainable rice production. However, the effectiveness of resistant cultivars is hindered by the genetic plasticity of the pathogen genome. Therefore, information on genetic resistance and virulence stability are vital to increase our understanding of the molecular basis of blast disease resistance. The present study set out to elucidate the resistance pattern and identify potential simple sequence repeat markers linked with rice blast disease. A backcross population (BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub>), derived from crossing MR264 and Pongsu Seribu 2 (PS2), was developed using marker-assisted backcross breeding. Twelve microsatellite markers carrying the blast resistance gene clearly demonstrated a polymorphic pattern between both parental lines. Among these, two markers, RM206 and RM5961, located on chromosome 11 exhibited the expected 1:1 testcross ratio in the BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> population. The 195 BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> plants inoculated against M. oryzae pathotype P7.2 showed a significantly different distribution in the backcrossed generation and followed Mendelian segregation based on a single-gene model. This indicates that blast resistance in PS2 is governed by a single dominant gene, which is linked to RM206 and RM5961 on chromosome 11.

Previous studies have shown that the dominant blast resistance gene Pi-2(t) confers resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogenic strains. Using a population of 292 recombinant inbred lines combined with bioinformatic analysis, we mapped Pi-2(t) between the SSR (simple-sequence repeat) marker SSR140 and the RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) marker JSH12, 0.9 cM from both SSR140 and JSH12. A physical map consisting of six overlapping BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) clones was anchored to the region containing the Pi-2(t) locus. By analyzing recombination events in this region, the Pi-2(t) locus was localized to a DNA fragment of 118 kb in length.

33203871,Two nuclear effectors of the rice blast fungus modulate host immunity via transcriptional reprogramming.,"Pathogens utilize multiple types of effectors to modulate plant immunity. Although many apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors have been reported, nuclear effectors have not been well characterized in fungal pathogens. Here, we characterize two nuclear effectors of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Both nuclear effectors are secreted via the biotrophic interfacial complex, translocated into the nuclei of initially penetrated and surrounding cells, and reprogram the expression of immunity-associated genes by binding on effector binding elements in rice. Their expression in transgenic rice causes ambivalent immunity: increased susceptibility to M. oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, hemibiotrophic pathogens, but enhanced resistance to Cochliobolus miyabeanus, a necrotrophic pathogen.

19453445,Metabolomic analysis reveals a common pattern of metabolic re-programming during invasion of three host plant species by Magnaporthe grisea.,"The mechanisms by which biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic fungal pathogens simultaneously subdue plant defences and sequester host nutrients are poorly understood. Using metabolite fingerprinting, we show that Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, dynamically re-programmes host metabolism during plant colonization. Identical patterns of metabolic change occurred during M. grisea infections in barley, rice and Brachypodium distachyon. Targeted metabolite profiling by GC-MS confirmed the modulation of a conserved set of metabolites. In pre-symptomatic tissues, malate and polyamines accumulated, rather than being utilized to generate defensive reactive oxygen species, and the levels of metabolites associated with amelioration of redox stress in various cellular compartments increased dramatically. The activity of NADP-malic enzyme and generation of reactive oxygen species were localized to pathogen penetration sites, and both appeared to be suppressed in compatible interactions. Early diversion of the shikimate pathway to produce quinate was observed, as well as accumulation of non-polymerized lignin precursors. These data are consistent with modulation of defensive phenylpropanoid metabolism by M. grisea and the inability of susceptible hosts to mount a hypersensitive reaction or produce lignified papillae (both involving reactive oxygen species) to restrict pathogen invasion. Rapid proliferation of M. grisea hyphae in plant tissue after 3 days was associated with accelerated nutrient acquisition and utilization by the pathogen. Conversion of photoassimilate into mannitol and glycerol for carbon sequestration and osmolyte production appear to drive hyphal growth. Taken together, our results suggest that fungal pathogens deploy a common metabolic re-programming strategy in diverse host species to suppress plant defence and colonize plant tissue.",mechanism biotrophic hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen simultaneously subdue plant defence sequester host nutrient poorly understood using metabolite fingerprinting show magnaporthe grisea causal agent rice blast disease dynamically reprogrammes host metabolism plant colonization identical pattern metabolic change occurred grisea infection barley rice brachypodium distachyon targeted metabolite profiling gcms confirmed modulation conserved set metabolite presymptomatic tissue malate polyamines accumulated rather utilized generate defensive reactive oxygen specie level metabolite associated amelioration redox stress various cellular compartment increased dramatically activity nadpmalic enzyme generation reactive oxygen specie localized pathogen penetration site appeared suppressed compatible interaction early diversion shikimate pathway produce quinate observed well accumulation nonpolymerized lignin precursor data consistent modulation defensive phenylpropanoid metabolism grisea inability susceptible host mount hypersensitive reaction produce lignified papilla involving reactive oxygen specie restrict pathogen invasion rapid proliferation grisea hypha plant tissue day associated accelerated nutrient acquisition utilization pathogen conversion photoassimilate mannitol glycerol carbon sequestration osmolyte production appear drive hyphal growth taken together result suggest fungal pathogen deploy common metabolic reprogramming strategy diverse host specie suppress plant defence colonize plant tissue,3,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe grisea causal agent rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['metabolite presymptomatic tissue malate polyamines']}",7

Most of the diversity preserved in the landraces which are well-known reservoirs of important traits for biotic and abiotic stresses. In the present study, the genetic diversity at twenty-four most significant blast resistance gene loci using twenty-eight gene specific markers were investigated in landraces originated from nine diverse rice ecologies of India. Based on phenotypic evaluation, landraces were classified into three distinct groups: highly resistant (21), moderately resistant (70) and susceptible (70). The landraces harbour a range of five to nineteen genes representing blast resistance allele with the frequency varied from 4.96% to 100%. The cluster analysis grouped entire 161 landraces into two major groups. Population structure along with other parameters was also analyzed to understand the evolution of blast resistance gene in rice. The population structure analysis and principal coordinate analysis classified the landraces into two sub-populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed maximum (93%) diversity within the population and least (7%) between populations. Five markers viz; K3957, Pikh, Pi2-i, RM212and RM302 were strongly associated with blast disease with the phenotypic variance of 1.4% to 7.6%.

26202491,BRHIS1 suppresses rice innate immunity through binding to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B variants.,"In the absence of pathogen attack, organisms usually suppress immune responses to reduce the negative effects of disease resistance. Monoubiquitination of histone variants at specific gene loci is crucial for gene expression, but its involvement in the regulation of plant immunity remains unclear. Here, we show that a rice SWI/SNF2 ATPase gene BRHIS1 is downregulated in response to the rice blast fungal pathogen or to the defense-priming-inducing compound BIT (1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2h)-one,1, 1-dioxide). The BRHIS1-containing complex represses the expression of some disease defense-related genes, including the pathogenesis-related gene OsPBZc and the leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like protein kinase gene OsSIRK1. This is achieved through BRHIS1 recruitment to the promoter regions of target genes through specific interaction with monoubiquitinated histone variants H2B.7 and H2A.Xa/H2A.Xb/H2A.3, in the absence of pathogen attack or BIT treatment. Our results show that rice disease defense genes are initially organized in an expression-ready state by specific monoubiquitination of H2A and H2B variants deposited on their promoter regions, but are kept suppressed by the BRHIS1 complex, facilitating the prompt initiation of innate immune responses in response to infection through the stringent regulation of BRHIS1.",absence pathogen attack organism usually suppress immune response reduce negative effect disease resistance monoubiquitination histone variant specific gene locus crucial gene expression involvement regulation plant immunity remains unclear show rice swisnf atpase gene brhis downregulated response rice blast fungal pathogen defensepriminginducing compound bit benzisothiazolhone dioxide brhiscontaining complex represses expression disease defenserelated gene including pathogenesisrelated gene ospbzc leucinerichrepeat lrr receptorlike protein kinase gene ossirk achieved brhis recruitment promoter region target gene specific interaction monoubiquitinated histone variant hb haxahaxbha absence pathogen attack bit treatment result show rice disease defense gene initially organized expressionready state specific monoubiquitination ha hb variant deposited promoter region kept suppressed brhis complex facilitating prompt initiation innate immune response response infection stringent regulation brhis,1,"{'Disease': ['negative effect disease resistance monoubiquitination histone variant specific gene locus crucial gene expression involvement regulation plant immunity', 'compound bit benzisothiazolhone dioxide brhiscontaining complex represses expression disease', 'rice disease defense gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['negative effect disease resistance monoubiquitination histone variant specific gene locus crucial gene expression involvement regulation plant immunity']}",8

Long-chain base phosphates including sphingosine-1-phosphate have been shown to act as signaling mediators in regulating programmed cell death (PCD) and stress responses in mammals. In the present study, we characterized a rice gene OsSPL1, encoding a putative sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase that is involved in metabolism of sphingosine-1-phosphate. Expression of OsSPL1 was down-regulated in rice plants after treatments with salicylic acid, benzothiadiazole and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, but was induced by infection with a virulent strain of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Transgenic tobacco lines with overexpression of OsSPL1 were generated and analyzed for the possible role of OsSPL1 in disease resistance response and PCD. The OsSPL1-overexpressing tobacco plants displayed increased susceptibility to infection of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci (Pst), the causal agent of wildfire disease, showing severity of disease symptom and bacterial titers in inoculated leaves, and attenuated pathogen-induced expression of PR genes after infection of Pst as compared to the wild-type and vector-transformed plants. Higher level of cell death, as revealed by dead cell staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes, was observed in the OsSPL1-overexpressing plants after treatment with fumonisin B1, a fungal toxin that induces PCD in plants.

36511124,An OsPRMT5-OsAGO2/miR1875-OsHXK1 module regulates rice immunity to blast disease.,"Rice ARGONAUTE2 (OsAGO2) is a core component of the rice RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is repressed by Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) infection. Whether and how OsAGO2-mediated gene silencing plays a role in rice blast resistance and which sRNAs participate in this process are unknown. Our results indicate that OsAGO2 is a key immune player that manipulates rice defense responses against blast disease. OsAGO2 associates with the 24-nt miR1875 and binds to the promoter region of HEXOKINASE1 (OsHXK1), which causes DNA methylation and leads to gene silencing. Our multiple genetic evidence showed that, without M. oryzae infection, OsAGO2/miR1875 RISC promoted OsHXK1 promoter DNA methylation and OsHXK1 silencing; after M. oryzae infection, the reduced OsAGO2/miR1875 led to a relatively activated OsHXK1 expression. OsHXK1 acts as a positive regulator of blast disease resistance that OsHXK1-OE rice exhibited enhanced resistance, whereas Cas9-Oshxk1 rice showed reduced resistance against M. oryzae infection. OsHXK1 may function through its sugar sensor activity as glucose induced defense-related gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in Nipponbare and OsHXK1-OE but not in Cas9-Oshxk1 rice. OsAGO2 itself is delicately regulated by OsPRMT5, which senses M. oryzae infection and attenuates OsAGO2-mediated gene silencing through OsAGO2 arginine methylation.

The circRNAs in IR25 were significantly more diverse than those in LTH, especially under <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Particularly, the number of circRNAs generated per parent gene was much higher in IR25 than in LTH and increased in IR25 but decreased in LTH upon <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. The higher diversity of circRNAs in IR25 was further associated with more frequent 3' and 5' alternative back-splicing and usage of complex splice sites. Moreover, a subset of circRNAs was differentially responsive to <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> in IR25 and LTH. We further confirmed that circR5g05160 promotes rice immunity against <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> Therefore, our data indicate that circRNA diversity is associated with different responses to <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> infection in rice and provide a starting point to investigate a new layer of regulation in the rice-<i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> interaction.",circular rna circrnas play role various biological process function rice ioryza sativai response imagnaporthe oryzaei remain elusive demonstrate circrnas involved riceim oryzaei interaction using comparative circrnasequencing transgenic approach identified highconfidence circrnas young leaf blastresistant accession international rice blast line pyriculariakantomtsuyuake ir blastsusceptible accession lijiangxin tuan heigu lth imi ioryzaeiinfected uninfected condition detected specifically upon imi ioryzaei infection circrnas ir significantly diverse lth especially im oryzaei infection particularly number circrnas generated per parent gene much higher ir lth increased ir decreased lth upon im oryzaei infection higher diversity circrnas ir associated frequent alternative backsplicing usage complex splice site moreover subset circrnas differentially responsive imi ioryzaei ir lth confirmed circrg promotes rice immunity imi ioryzaei therefore data indicate circrna diversity associated different response imi ioryzaei infection rice provide starting point investigate new layer regulation riceimi ioryzaei interaction,11,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
22370743,LOX genes in blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) resistance in rice.,"Plant Lipoxygenases (LOX) are known to play major role in plant immunity by providing front-line defense against pathogen-induced injury. To verify this, we isolated a full-length OsLOX3 gene and also 12 OsLOX cDNA clones from Oryza sativa indica (cultivar Pusa Basmati 1). We have examined the role played by LOXs in plant development and during attack by blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea. Gene expression, promoter region analysis, and biochemical and protein structure analysis of isolated OsLOX3 revealed significant homology with LOX super family. Protein sequence comparison of OsLOXs revealed high levels of homology when compared with japonica rice (up to100%) and Arabidopsis (up to 64%). Isolated LOX3 gene and 12 OsLOX cDNAs contained the catalytic LOX domains much required for oxygen binding and synthesis of oxylipins. Amino acid composition, protein secondary structure, and promoter region analysis (with abundance of motifs CGTCA and TGACG) support the role of OsLOX3 gene in providing resistance to diseases in rice plants. OsLOX3 gene expression analysis of root, shoot, flag leaf, and developing and mature seed revealed organ specific patterns during rice plant development and gave evidence to association between tissue location and physiological roles played by individual OsLOXs. Increased defense activity of oxylipins was observed as demonstrated by PCR amplification of OsLOX3 gene and upon inoculation with virulent strains of M. grisea and ectopic application of methyl jasmonate in the injured leaf tissue in adult rice plants.",plant lipoxygenases lox known play major role plant immunity providing frontline defense pathogeninduced injury verify isolated fulllength oslox gene also oslox cdna clone oryza sativa indica cultivar pusa basmati examined role played lox plant development attack blast pathogen magnaporthe grisea gene expression promoter region analysis biochemical protein structure analysis isolated oslox revealed significant homology lox super family protein sequence comparison osloxs revealed high level homology compared japonica rice arabidopsis isolated lox gene oslox cdna contained catalytic lox domain much required oxygen binding synthesis oxylipins amino acid composition protein secondary structure promoter region analysis abundance motif cgtca tgacg support role oslox gene providing resistance disease rice plant oslox gene expression analysis root shoot flag leaf developing mature seed revealed organ specific pattern rice plant development gave evidence association tissue location physiological role played individual osloxs increased defense activity oxylipins observed demonstrated pcr amplification oslox gene upon inoculation virulent strain grisea ectopic application methyl jasmonate injured leaf tissue adult rice plant,7,"{'Disease': ['resistance disease rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
31451649,Large-scale identification and functional analysis of <i>NLR</i> genes in blast resistance in the Tetep rice genome sequence.,"Tetep is a rice cultivar known for broad-spectrum resistance to blast, a devastating fungal disease. The molecular basis for its broad-spectrum resistance is still poorly understood. Is it because Tetep has many more <i>NLR</i> genes than other cultivars? Or does Tetep possess multiple major <i>NLR</i> genes that can individually confer broad-spectrum resistance to blast? Moreover, are there many interacting <i>NLR</i> pairs in the Tetep genome? We sequenced its genome, obtained a high-quality assembly, and annotated 455 nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (<i>NLR</i>) genes. We cloned and tested 219 <i>NLR</i> genes as transgenes in 2 susceptible cultivars using 5 to 12 diversified pathogen strains; in many cases, fewer than 12 strains were successfully cultured for testing. Ninety cloned <i>NLR</i>s showed resistance to 1 or more pathogen strains and each strain was recognized by multiple <i>NLR</i>s. However, few <i>NLR</i>s showed resistance to >6 strains, so multiple <i>NLR</i>s are apparently required for Tetep's broad-spectrum resistance to blast. This was further supported by the pedigree analyses, which suggested a correlation between resistance and the number of Tetep-derived <i>NLR</i>s. In developing a method to identify <i>NLR</i> pairs each of which functions as a unit, we found that >20% of the <i>NLR</i>s in the Tetep and 3 other rice genomes are paired. Finally, we designed an extensive set of molecular markers for rapidly introducing clustered and paired <i>NLR</i>s in the Tetep genome for breeding new resistant cultivars.

23928947,Growth in rice cells requires de novo purine biosynthesis by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Increasing incidences of human disease, crop destruction and ecosystem perturbations are attributable to fungi and threaten socioeconomic progress and food security on a global scale. The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating pathogen of cultivated rice, but its metabolic requirements in the host are unclear. Here we report that a purine-requiring mutant of M. oryzae could develop functional appressoria, penetrate host cells and undergo the morphogenetic transition to elaborate bulbous invasive hyphae from primary hyphae, but further in planta growth was aborted. Invasive hyphal growth following rice cell ingress is thus dependent on de novo purine biosynthesis by the pathogen and, moreover, plant sources of purines are neither available to the mutant nor required by the wild type during the early biotrophic phase of infection. This work provides new knowledge about the metabolic interface between fungus and host that might be applicable to other important intracellular fungal pathogens.",increasing incidence human disease crop destruction ecosystem perturbation attributable fungi threaten socioeconomic progress food security global scale blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae devastating pathogen cultivated rice metabolic requirement host unclear report purinerequiring mutant oryzae could develop functional appressoria penetrate host cell undergo morphogenetic transition elaborate bulbous invasive hypha primary hypha planta growth aborted invasive hyphal growth following rice cell ingres thus dependent de novo purine biosynthesis pathogen moreover plant source purine neither available mutant required wild type early biotrophic phase infection work provides new knowledge metabolic interface fungus host might applicable important intracellular fungal pathogen,3,"{'Disease': ['increasing incidence human disease crop destruction ecosystem perturbation', 'socioeconomic progress food security global scale blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae devastating pathogen', 'new knowledge metabolic interface fungus host'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
15067388,Association between molecular markers and blast resistance in an advanced backcross population of rice.,"An advanced backcross population consisting of 80 BC(3)F(3) lines derived from rice vars. Vandana/ Moroberekan was analysed for blast resistance and genotyped with 50 candidate genes and 23 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Six candidate defence response genes [thaumatin, three nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat sequences from maize and two resistance gene analogue (RGA) markers] and one SSR marker (RM21) were significantly associated with partial blast resistance in rice ( P=0.01). These markers accounted for phenotypic variation ranging from 9.6% to 29.4% and contributed to 76% of the total variation of percentage diseased leaf area (DLA) observed under natural infection. Four candidate genes (oxalate oxidase, 14-3-3 protein and two RGA markers) and four SSR markers (RM21, RM168, RM215 and RM250) were significantly associated with resistance to a single pathogen isolate, PO6-6. Among these, two markers were for DLA, five for lesion number and one for lesion size. These markers accounted for 9.1-28.7% of the phenotypic variation. A moderate correlation ( r=0.48, P<0.01) was found between the level of partial resistance measured in the greenhouse and that measured under natural conditions. Analysis of BC(3)F(4) progeny using genotypes of BC(3)F(3) confirmed the phenotypic contribution of these markers. Cluster analysis of DNA profiles showed that the BC(3) population was genetically similar (>85%) to the recurrent parent Vandana. Although no obvious relationship between DNA profiles and resistant phenotypes was observed, three lines (VM19, VM46 and VM76) in a cluster with high similarity to Vandana (89-96%) expressed a high level of partial blast resistance in the field. Analysis of disease progress in the field confirmed the performance of selected lines based on greenhouse and nursery analyses.

38964088,"The dual-specificity kinase MoLKH1-mediated cell cycle, autophagy, and suppression of plant immunity is critical for development and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.","Cell cycle progression, autophagic cell death during appressorium development, and ROS degradation at the infection site are important for the development of rice blast disease. However, the association of cell cycle, autophagy and ROS detoxification remains largely unknown in M. oryzae. Here, we identify the dual-specificity kinase MoLKH1, which serves as an important cell cycle regulator required for appressorium formation by regulating cytokinesis and cytoskeleton in M. oryzae. MoLKH1 is transcriptionally activated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and required for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced autophagic cell death and suppression of ROS-activated plant defense during plant invasion of M. oryzae. In addition, the Molkh1 mutant also showed several phenotypic defects, including delayed growth, abnormal conidiation, damaged cell wall integrity, impaired glycogen and lipid transport, reduced secretion of extracellular enzymes and effectors, and attenuated virulence of M. oryzae. Nuclear localization of MoLKH1 requires the nuclear localization sequence, Lammer motif, as well as the kinase active site and ATP-binding site in this protein. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that each of them plays crucial roles in fungal growth and pathogenicity of M. oryzae.

18944192,Genetic differentiation of Magnaporthe oryzae populations from scouting plots and commercial rice fields in Korea.,"A previous study of the diversity and population structure of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, over a 20-year period in Korea, found novel fingerprint haplotypes each year, and the authors hypothesized that populations might experience annual bottlenecks. Based on this model, we predicted that M. oryzae populations would have little or no genetic differentiation among geographic regions because rice blast is commonly found throughout Korea each year and M. oryzae would have to disperse from small populations surviving annually between rice crops. To test this hypothesis, we sampled M. oryzae from rice fields in eight provinces in Korea in a single year (1999). In four provinces, we sampled from a set of rice cultivars commonly grown in commercial fields (group I); because of low disease incidence in four other provinces, we could not sample from commercial fields and instead sampled from scouting plots of different cultivars set up for detecting new pathotypes of M. oryzae (group II). All isolates were genotyped with DNA fingerprint probes MGR586 and MAGGY, a telomere-linked gene family member TLH1, the PWL2 host specificity gene and mating type. Fingerprint haplotypes clustered into two distinct lineages corresponding to the two sets of cultivars (groups I and II), with haplotype similarities of 71% between lineages and >76% within lineages. Isolates from the same cultivar within group I were genetically differentiated among locations, and isolates within the same location were differentiated among cultivars. Differentiation for TLH1 and PWL2 was significant (P < 0.03), but not as strong as for fingerprint markers. Similar analyses were not possible among group II isolates because too few isolates were available from any one cultivar. All isolates were in the same mating type, Mat1-1, ruling out sexual reproduction as a source of novel haplotypes. When the 1999 samples were compared with the historical samples from the previous study, haplotypes of group I formed a separate cluster, while those of group II clustered with haplotypes from the historical sample. Altogether, geographic subdivision, monomorphism of mating type, and correlation of haplotypes to sets of cultivars are not consistent with the hypothesis of repeated turnover of haplotypes. Instead, the previous correlations of haplotypes to year might have been caused by inadequate sampling of haplotypes each year, highlighting the need for studies of population genetics to be conducted with systematic samples collected to address specific questions.",previous study diversity population structure rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae year period korea found novel fingerprint haplotype year author hypothesized population might experience annual bottleneck based model predicted oryzae population would little genetic differentiation among geographic region rice blast commonly found throughout korea year oryzae would disperse small population surviving annually rice crop test hypothesis sampled oryzae rice field eight province korea single year four province sampled set rice cultivar commonly grown commercial field group low disease incidence four province could sample commercial field instead sampled scouting plot different cultivar set detecting new pathotypes oryzae group ii isolates genotyped dna fingerprint probe mgr maggy telomerelinked gene family member tlh pwl host specificity gene mating type fingerprint haplotype clustered two distinct lineage corresponding two set cultivar group ii haplotype similarity lineage within lineage isolates cultivar within group genetically differentiated among location isolates within location differentiated among cultivar differentiation tlh pwl significant p strong fingerprint marker similar analysis possible among group ii isolates isolates available one cultivar isolates mating type mat ruling sexual reproduction source novel haplotype sample compared historical sample previous study haplotype group formed separate cluster group ii clustered haplotype historical sample altogether geographic subdivision monomorphism mating type correlation haplotype set cultivar consistent hypothesis repeated turnover haplotype instead previous correlation haplotype year might caused inadequate sampling haplotype year highlighting need study population genetics conducted systematic sample collected address specific question,13,"{'Disease': ['previous study diversity population structure rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae year period korea', 'commonly grown commercial field group low disease incidence'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",2
31557947,Overexpression of <i>Magnaporthe Oryzae</i> Systemic Defense Trigger 1 (MoSDT1) Confers Improved Rice Blast Resistance in Rice.,"The effector proteins secreted by a pathogen not only promote virulence and infection of the pathogen, but also trigger plant defense response. Therefore, these proteins could be used as important genetic resources for transgenic improvement of plant disease resistance. <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> systemic defense trigger 1 (MoSDT1) is an effector protein. In this study, we compared the agronomic traits and blast disease resistance between wild type (WT) and MoSDT1 overexpressing lines in rice. Under control conditions, MoSDT1 transgenic lines increased the number of tillers without affecting kernel morphology. In addition, MoSDT1 transgenic lines conferred improved blast resistance, with significant effects on the activation of callose deposition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and cell death. On the one hand, overexpression of MoSDT1 could delay biotrophy-necrotrophy switch through regulating the expression of <i>biotrophy-associated secreted protein 4</i> (<i>BAS4</i>) and <i>Magnaporthe oryzaecell death inducing protein 1 (MoCDIP1</i>), and activate plant defense response by regulating the expression of <i>Bsr-d1</i>, <i>MYBS1</i>, <i>WRKY45</i>, <i>peroxidase</i> (<i>POD</i>), <i>heat shock protein 90</i> (<i>HSP90</i>), <i>allenoxide synthase 2</i> (<i>AOS2</i>), <i>phenylalanine ammonia lyase</i> (<i>PAL</i>), <i>pathogenesis-related protein 1a</i> (<i>PR1a</i>) in rice. On the other hand, overexpression of MoSDT1 could increase the accumulation of some defense-related primary metabolites such as two aromatic amino acids (L-tyrosine and L-tryptohan), 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid, which could be converted to ethylene, vanillic acid and L-saccharopine. Taken together, overexpression of MoSDT1 confers improved rice blast resistance in rice, through modulation of callose deposition, ROS accumulation, the expression of defense-related genes, and the accumulation of some primary metabolites.",effector protein secreted pathogen promote virulence infection pathogen also trigger plant defense response therefore protein could used important genetic resource transgenic improvement plant disease resistance imagnaporthe oryzaei systemic defense trigger mosdt effector protein study compared agronomic trait blast disease resistance wild type wt mosdt overexpressing line rice control condition mosdt transgenic line increased number tiller without affecting kernel morphology addition mosdt transgenic line conferred improved blast resistance significant effect activation callose deposition reactive oxygen specie ro accumulation cell death one hand overexpression mosdt could delay biotrophynecrotrophy switch regulating expression ibiotrophyassociated secreted protein ibasi imagnaporthe oryzaecell death inducing protein mocdipi activate plant defense response regulating expression ibsrdi imybsi iwrkyi iperoxidasei ipodi iheat shock protein ihspi iallenoxide synthase iaosi iphenylalanine ammonia lyasei ipali ipathogenesisrelated protein ai iprai rice hand overexpression mosdt could increase accumulation defenserelated primary metabolite two aromatic amino acid ltyrosine ltryptohan aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid could converted ethylene vanillic acid lsaccharopine taken together overexpression mosdt confers improved rice blast resistance rice modulation callose deposition ro accumulation expression defenserelated gene accumulation primary metabolite,4,"{'Disease': ['important genetic resource transgenic improvement plant disease resistance imagnaporthe oryzaei systemic defense trigger mosdt effector protein study'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector protein', 'important genetic resource transgenic improvement plant disease resistance imagnaporthe oryzaei systemic defense trigger mosdt effector protein study', 'improved blast resistance significant effect activation callose deposition reactive oxygen specie']}",7
30446614,Resistance protein Pit interacts with the GEF OsSPK1 to activate OsRac1 and trigger rice immunity.,"<i>Resistance</i> (<i>R</i>) genes encode intracellular nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) family proteins that serve as critical plant immune receptors to induce effector-triggered immunity (ETI). NLR proteins possess a tripartite domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal variable region, a central nucleotide-binding domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat. N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domains of R proteins appear to serve as platforms to trigger immune responses, because overexpression of the CC or TIR domain of some R proteins is sufficient to induce an immune response. Because direct downstream signaling molecules of R proteins remain obscure, the molecular mechanisms by which R proteins regulate downstream signaling are largely unknown. We reported previously that a rice R protein named Pit triggers ETI through a small GTPase, OsRac1, although how Pit activates OsRac1 is unclear. Here, we identified OsSPK1, a DOCK family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as an interactor of Pit and activator for OsRac1. OsSPK1 contributes to signaling by two disease-resistance genes, <i>Pit</i> and <i>Pia</i>, against the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and facilitates OsRac1 activation in vitro and in vivo. The CC domain of Pit is required for its binding to OsSPK1, OsRac1 activation, and the induction of cell death. Overall, we conclude that OsSPK1 is a direct and key signaling target of Pit-mediated immunity.

33543762,Structural Alteration of Rice Pectin Affects Cell Wall Mechanical Strength and Pathogenicity of the Rice Blast Fungus Under Weak Light Conditions.,"Pectin, a component of the plant cell wall, is involved in cell adhesion and environmental adaptations. We generated OsPG-FOX rice lines with little pectin due to overexpression of the gene encoding a pectin-degrading enzyme [polygalacturonase (PG)]. Overexpression of OsPG2 in rice under weak light conditions increased the activity of PG, which increased the degradation of pectin in the cell wall, thereby reducing adhesion. Under weak light conditions, the overexpression of OsPG decreased the pectin content and cell adhesion, resulting in abnormally large intercellular gaps and facilitating invasion by the rice blast fungus. OsPG2-FOX plants had weaker mechanical properties and greater sensitivity to biotic stresses than wild-type (WT) plants. However, the expression levels of disease resistance genes in non-infected leaves of OsPG2-FOX were more than twice as high as those of the WT and the intensity of disease symptoms was reduced, compared with the WT. Under normal light conditions, overexpression of OsPG2 decreased the pectin content, but did not affect cell adhesion and sensitivity to biotic stresses. Therefore, PG plays a role in regulating intercellular adhesion and the response to biotic stresses in rice.",pectin component plant cell wall involved cell adhesion environmental adaptation generated ospgfox rice line little pectin due overexpression gene encoding pectindegrading enzyme polygalacturonase pg overexpression ospg rice weak light condition increased activity pg increased degradation pectin cell wall thereby reducing adhesion weak light condition overexpression ospg decreased pectin content cell adhesion resulting abnormally large intercellular gap facilitating invasion rice blast fungus ospgfox plant weaker mechanical property greater sensitivity biotic stress wildtype wt plant however expression level disease resistance gene noninfected leaf ospgfox twice high wt intensity disease symptom reduced compared wt normal light condition overexpression ospg decreased pectin content affect cell adhesion sensitivity biotic stress therefore pg play role regulating intercellular adhesion response biotic stress rice,8,"{'Disease': ['invasion rice blast fungus ospgfox plant weaker mechanical property greater sensitivity biotic stress wildtype wt plant', 'however expression level disease resistance gene noninfected leaf', 'twice high wt intensity disease symptom'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['twice high wt intensity disease symptom']}",7
34170614,Engineering broad-spectrum disease-resistant rice by editing multiple susceptibility genes.,"Rice blast and bacterial blight are important diseases of rice (Oryza sativa) caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), respectively. Breeding rice varieties for broad-spectrum resistance is considered the most effective and sustainable approach to controlling both diseases. Although dominant resistance genes have been extensively used in rice breeding and production, generating disease-resistant varieties by altering susceptibility (S) genes that facilitate pathogen compatibility remains unexplored. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated loss-of-function mutants of the S genes Pi21 and Bsr-d1 and showed that they had increased resistance to M. oryzae. We also generated a knockout mutant of the S gene Xa5 that showed increased resistance to Xoo. Remarkably, a triple mutant of all three S genes had significantly enhanced resistance to both M. oryzae and Xoo. Moreover, the triple mutant was comparable to the wild type in regard to key agronomic traits, including plant height, effective panicle number per plant, grain number per panicle, seed setting rate, and thousand-grain weight. These results demonstrate that the simultaneous editing of multiple S genes is a powerful strategy for generating new rice varieties with broad-spectrum resistance.",rice blast bacterial blight important disease rice oryza sativa caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae bacterium xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo respectively breeding rice variety broadspectrum resistance considered effective sustainable approach controlling disease although dominant resistance gene extensively used rice breeding production generating diseaseresistant variety altering susceptibility gene facilitate pathogen compatibility remains unexplored using crisprcas technology generated lossoffunction mutant gene pi bsrd showed increased resistance oryzae also generated knockout mutant gene xa showed increased resistance xoo remarkably triple mutant three gene significantly enhanced resistance oryzae xoo moreover triple mutant comparable wild type regard key agronomic trait including plant height effective panicle number per plant grain number per panicle seed setting rate thousandgrain weight result demonstrate simultaneous editing multiple gene powerful strategy generating new rice variety broadspectrum resistance,8,"{'Disease': ['rice blast bacterial blight important disease rice oryza sativa', 'fungus magnaporthe oryzae bacterium xanthomonas', 'effective sustainable approach controlling disease', 'diseaseresistant variety'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective sustainable approach controlling disease', 'plant height effective panicle number']}",13
19719483,"Effects of catalase on the accumulation of H(2)O(2) in rice cells inoculated with rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.","Roles of H(2)O(2) in the infection process of Magnaporthe oryzae on rice were investigated. In a leaf sheath assay for up to 48 h post-inoculation, the absence or presence of catalase in the conidia suspension was correlated with the level of accumulated H(2)O(2) in infected leaf cells, as observed by staining with 3',3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. In the incompatible interaction, the appearance of autofluorescence or frequency of cell death characterized by granulation (symptoms characteristic of hypersensitive responses) was not significantly affected by the presence of catalase in the conidia suspension.

29242377,The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity.,"The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.",calciumdependent protein kinase oscpk demonstrated play important role salt drought tolerance plant growth development rice ioryza sativai however little known molecular mechanism underlying oscpk function rice immunity study demonstrated generation oxidative burst pathogenesisrelated gene expression triggered microbeassociated molecular pattern significantly enhanced ioscpki mutant mutant line resistant bacterial blight fungal blast disease wildtype plant indicating oscpk negatively regulates innate immunity rice oscpk identified interact receptorlike cytoplasmic kinase osrlck osrlck accumulation negatively regulated oscpk interestingly kinasedead oscpk promotes osrlck degradation strongly wildtype protein oscpk osrlck mutually phosphorylate form feedback loop moreover kinase activity phosphorylation oscpk osrlck contribute stability osrlck finding indicate kinaseinactive oscpk promotes osrlck degradation restricts plant defense whereas activation oscpkosrlck phosphorylation circuit invalidates osrlck degradation machinery thus enhancing plant immunity collectively study proposes novel defense buffering mechanism mediated oscpk finetunes microbeassociated molecular patterntriggered immunity rice,1,"{'Disease': ['significantly enhanced ioscpki mutant mutant line resistant bacterial blight fungal blast disease wildtype plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
39285518,A glance at structural biology in advancing rice blast fungus research.,"The filamentous fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is widely recognized as a notorious plant pathogen responsible for causing rice blasts. With rapid advancements in molecular biology technologies, numerous regulatory mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated. However, most recent studies have predominantly focused on infection-related pathways or host defence mechanisms, which may be insufficient for developing novel structure-based prevention strategies. A substantial body of literature has utilized cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to explore the relationships between functional components, shedding light on the identification of potential drug targets. Owing to the complexity of protein extraction and stochastic nature of crystallization, obtaining high-quality structures remains a significant challenge for the scientific community. Emerging computational tools such as AlphaFold for structural prediction, docking for interaction analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to replicate in vivo conditions provide novel avenues for overcoming these challenges. In this review, we aim to consolidate the structural biological advancements in <i>M. oryzae</i>, drawing upon mature experimental experiences from other species such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and mammals.

Interestingly, the OsAPX2 inductions were more potent and rapid than OsAPX1, whose expression increased gradually with time. These inductions were influenced by light signal(s), and showed requirement for certain de novo synthesized protein factor(s). Intriguingly, OsAPX1/2 mRNAs expression manifested a clear rhythmicity under light/dark cycle.

38073141,Effector-triggered susceptibility by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast, the most destructive disease of cultivated rice world-wide, is caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. To cause disease in plants, M. oryzae secretes a diverse range of effector proteins to suppress plant defense responses, modulate cellular processes, and support pathogen growth. Some effectors can be secreted by appressoria even before host penetration, while others accumulate in the apoplast, or enter living plant cells where they target specific plant subcellular compartments. During plant infection, the blast fungus induces the formation of a specialized plant structure known as the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC), which appears to be crucial for effector delivery into plant cells. Here, we review recent advances in the cell biology of M. oryzae-host interactions and show how new breakthroughs in disease control have stemmed from an increased understanding of effector proteins of M. oryzae are deployed and delivered into plant cells to enable pathogen invasion and host susceptibility.",rice blast destructive disease cultivated rice worldwide caused filamentous fungus magnaporthe oryzae cause disease plant oryzae secretes diverse range effector protein suppress plant defense response modulate cellular process support pathogen growth effector secreted appressoria even host penetration others accumulate apoplast enter living plant cell target specific plant subcellular compartment plant infection blast fungus induces formation specialized plant structure known biotrophic interfacial complex bic appears crucial effector delivery plant cell review recent advance cell biology oryzaehost interaction show new breakthrough disease control stemmed increased understanding effector protein oryzae deployed delivered plant cell enable pathogen invasion host susceptibility,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast destructive disease', 'filamentous fungus magnaporthe oryzae cause disease plant oryzae secretes diverse range effector protein suppress plant defense response', 'apoplast enter living plant cell target specific plant subcellular compartment plant infection blast fungus', 'new breakthrough disease control'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['filamentous fungus magnaporthe oryzae cause disease plant oryzae secretes diverse range effector protein suppress plant defense response', 'crucial effector delivery plant cell review recent advance cell biology', 'increased understanding effector protein oryzae']}",7
26183036,Functional divergence of duplicated genes results in a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus.,"We characterized a novel blast resistance gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus; Pi50 is derived from functional divergence of duplicated genes. The unique features of Pi50 should facilitate its use in rice breeding and improve our understanding of the evolution of resistance specificities. Rice blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, poses constant, major threats to stable rice production worldwide. The deployment of broad-spectrum resistance (R) genes provides the most effective and economical means for disease control. In this study, we characterize the broad-spectrum R gene Pi50 at the Pi2/9 locus, which is embedded within a tandem cluster of 12 genes encoding proteins with nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains. In contrast with other Pi2/9 locus, the Pi50 cluster contains four duplicated genes (Pi50_NBS4_1 to 4) with extremely high nucleotide sequence similarity. Moreover, these duplicated genes encode two kinds of proteins (Pi50_NBS4_1/2 and Pi50_NBS4_3/4) that differ by four amino acids. Complementation tests and resistance spectrum analyses revealed that Pi50_NBS4_1/2, not Pi50_NBS4_3/4, control the novel resistance specificity as observed in the Pi50 near isogenic line, NIL-e1. Pi50 shares greater than 96 % amino acid sequence identity with each of three other R proteins, i.e., Pi9, Piz-t, and Pi2, and has amino acid changes predominantly within the LRR region.

39333318,OsHRZ1 negatively regulates rice resistant to Magnaporthe oryzae infection by targeting OsVOZ2.,"Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae significantly reduces yield production. Blast resistance is closely associated with iron (Fe) status, but the mechanistic basis linking iron status to immune function in rice remains largely unknown. Here, iron-binding haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 was confirmed to play key roles in iron-mediated rice blast resistance. The expression of OsHRZ1 was suppressed by M. oryzae inoculation and high iron treatment. Both mutants of OsHRZ1 enhanced rice resistance to M. oryzae. OsPR1a was up-regulated in OsHRZ1 mutants. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and Co-IP assay results indicated that OsHRZ1 interacts with Vascular Plant One Zinc Finger 2 (OsVOZ2) in the nucleus. Additionally, the vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that OsHRZ1 can ubiquitinate OsVOZ2 and mediate the degradation of OsVOZ2. The mutants of OsVOZ2 showed reduced resistance to M. oryzae and down-regulated the expression of OsPR1a. Yeast one-hybrid, EMSA, and dual-luciferase reporter assay results indicated that OsVOZ2 directly binds to the promoter of OsPR1a, activating its expression. In summary, OsHRZ1 plays an important role in rice disease resistance by mediated degradation of OsVOZ2 thus shaping PR gene expression dynamics in rice cells. This highlights an important link between iron signaling and rice pathogen defenses.",rice blast disease caused magnaporthe oryzae significantly reduces yield production blast resistance closely associated iron fe status mechanistic basis linking iron status immune function rice remains largely unknown ironbinding haemerythrin ring ubiquitin ligases oshrz confirmed play key role ironmediated rice blast resistance expression oshrz suppressed oryzae inoculation high iron treatment mutant oshrz enhanced rice resistance oryzae ospra upregulated oshrz mutant yeast twohybrid bimolecular fluorescence complementation coip assay result indicated oshrz interacts vascular plant one zinc finger osvoz nucleus additionally vitro ubiquitination assay indicated oshrz ubiquitinate osvoz mediate degradation osvoz mutant osvoz showed reduced resistance oryzae downregulated expression ospra yeast onehybrid emsa dualluciferase reporter assay result indicated osvoz directly bind promoter ospra activating expression summary oshrz play important role rice disease resistance mediated degradation osvoz thus shaping pr gene expression dynamic rice cell highlight important link iron signaling rice pathogen defense,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'important role rice disease resistance mediated degradation osvoz'], 'Treatment': ['oryzae inoculation high iron treatment mutant oshrz'], 'Symptom': []}",10

In this study, two new Ospgip genes, named Ospgip6 and Ospgip7 with consensus sequence of ten imperfect LRR motif located on rice chromosomes 8 and 9, were identified using BLAST analysis. Both of them appear to be extracellular glycoproteins. To have a global view of the dynamic gene expression pattern, seven Ospgip genes were first analyzed using the Affymetrix rice genome array data from online resource. All of these seven Ospgip genes showed variable expression patterns among tissues/organs. In order to further investigate the potential function of these Ospgip genes, the responses of Ospgip genes to the treatment of various phytohormones (abscisic acid, brassinosteroid, gibberellic acid, 3-indole acetic acid, jasmonic acid, kinetin, naphthalene acetic acid and salicylic acid) as well as fungal infection were analyzed by real-time PCR using time course array. Generally, all the Ospgip genes were slightly up-regulated in the indica rice cultivar Minghui 63 under GA(3), KT and NAA treatments (except Ospgip2, which was down-regulated under KT treatment). In the japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, Ospgip genes were regulated by most treatments with the response time variability. We also analyzed putative cis-elements in the promoter regions of Ospgip genes. This dataset provided a versatile resource to understand the regulatory network of Ospgip genes during the process of phytohormones treatment and fungal infection in the model monocotyledonous plant, rice, and could aid in the transgenic breeding against rice fungal diseases.

23204406,The Magnaporthe oryzae effector AvrPiz-t targets the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.,"Although the functions of a few effector proteins produced by bacterial and oomycete plant pathogens have been elucidated in recent years, information for the vast majority of pathogen effectors is still lacking, particularly for those of plant-pathogenic fungi. Here, we show that the avirulence effector AvrPiz-t from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae preferentially accumulates in the specialized structure called the biotrophic interfacial complex and is then translocated into rice (Oryza sativa) cells. Ectopic expression of AvrPiz-t in transgenic rice suppresses the flg22- and chitin-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances susceptibility to M. oryzae, indicating that AvrPiz-t functions to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity in rice. Interaction assays show that AvrPiz-t suppresses the ubiquitin ligase activity of the rice RING E3 ubiquitin ligase APIP6 and that, in return, APIP6 ubiquitinates AvrPiz-t in vitro. Interestingly, agroinfection assays reveal that AvrPiz-t and AvrPiz-t Interacting Protein 6 (APIP6) are both degraded when coexpressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Silencing of APIP6 in transgenic rice leads to a significant reduction of flg22-induced ROS generation, suppression of defense-related gene expression, and enhanced susceptibility of rice plants to M. oryzae.

18266905,Rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 is involved in phytochrome and jasmonate signalling.,"Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important negative regulator of light-regulated coleoptile elongation in rice. We isolated rice JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (osjar1) mutants from the Tos17 mutant panel by BLAST search. In far-red and blue lights, osjar1 coleoptiles were longer if compared with the wild type (WT), indicating that OsJar1 participates in the suppression of coleoptile elongation in these light conditions, while the mutant did not show a clear phenotype in red light. The analysis of OsJar1 expression in phytochrome (phy) mutants revealed that phytochrome A (phyA) and phytochrome B (phyB) act redundantly to induce this gene by red light, presumably. Unexpectedly, blue light-induced expression of OsJar1 gene was impaired in phyA-deficient mutants, indicating the involvement of phyA in the blue light signalling. In WT seedlings, OsJar1 transcripts were up-regulated transiently in response to treatment with exogenous methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA). The dose-response curve of the MeJA treatment showed a characteristic pattern: concentrations as low as 4.5 nM could induce OsJar1 transcription, while the gene was superinduced at a concentration of 450 microM MeJA.

38290434,Distinct genomic contexts predict gene presence-absence variation in different pathotypes of Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Fungi use the accessory gene content of their pangenomes to adapt to their environments. While gene presence-absence variation contributes to shaping accessory gene reservoirs, the genomic contexts that shape these events remain unclear. Since pangenome studies are typically species-wide and do not analyze different populations separately, it is yet to be uncovered whether presence-absence variation patterns and mechanisms are consistent across populations. Fungal plant pathogens are useful models for studying presence-absence variation because they rely on it to adapt to their hosts, and members of a species often infect distinct hosts. We analyzed gene presence-absence variation in the blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae), and found that presence-absence variation genes involved in host-pathogen and microbe-microbe interactions may drive the adaptation of the fungus to its environment. We then analyzed genomic and epigenomic features of presence-absence variation and observed that proximity to transposable elements, gene GC content, gene length, expression level in the host, and histone H3K27me3 marks were different between presence-absence variation genes and conserved genes. We used these features to construct a model that was able to predict whether a gene is likely to experience presence-absence variation with high precision (86.06%) and recall (92.88%) in M. oryzae. Finally, we found that presence-absence variation genes in the rice and wheat pathotypes of M. oryzae differed in their number and their genomic context. Our results suggest that genomic and epigenomic features of gene presence-absence variation can be used to better understand and predict fungal pangenome evolution.

A total of 511 clones was sequenced from a cDNA library constructed from rice leaves (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) infected with M. grisea strain 70-15 to generate 296 nonredundant ESTs. The sequences of 293 clones (57.3%) significantly matched National Center for Biotechnology Information database entries; 221 showed homologies with previously identified plant genes and 72 with fungal genes. Among the genes with assigned functions, 32.8% were associated with metabolism, 29.4% with cell/organism defense or pathogenicity, and 18.4% with gene/protein expression. cDNAs encoding a type I metallothionein (MTs-1) of rice and a homolog of glucose-repressible gene 1 (GRG1) of Neurospora crassa were the most abundant representatives of plant and fungal genes, comprising 2.9 and 1.6% of the total clones, respectively. The expression patterns of 10 ESTs, five each from rice and M. grisea, were analyzed. Five defense-related genes in rice, including four pathogenesis-related genes and MTs-1, were highly expressed during M. grisea infection. Expression of five stress-inducible or pathogenicity-related genes of the fungus, including two hydrophobin genes, was also induced during growth within the host. Further characterization of the genes represented in this study would be an aid in unraveling the mechanisms of pathogenicity of M. grisea and the defense responses of rice.",expressed sequence tag est analysis applied identify rice gene involved defense response infection blast fungus magnaporthe grisea fungal gene involved growth within host compatible interaction total clone sequenced cdna library constructed rice leaf oryza sativa cv nipponbare infected grisea strain generate nonredundant est sequence clone significantly matched national center biotechnology information database entry showed homology previously identified plant gene fungal gene among gene assigned function associated metabolism cellorganism defense pathogenicity geneprotein expression cdna encoding type metallothionein mt rice homolog glucoserepressible gene grg neurospora crassa abundant representative plant fungal gene comprising total clone respectively expression pattern est five rice grisea analyzed five defenserelated gene rice including four pathogenesisrelated gene mt highly expressed grisea infection expression five stressinducible pathogenicityrelated gene fungus including two hydrophobin gene also induced growth within host characterization gene represented study would aid unraveling mechanism pathogenicity grisea defense response rice,7,"{'Disease': ['defense response infection blast fungus magnaporthe grisea fungal gene', 'five stressinducible pathogenicityrelated gene fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8

To isolate the OsLMS gene, we crossed the lms mutant to Kasalath (indica), and used mutant F(2) plants to initially map the candidate region to about 322-kb on the long arm of chromosome 2. Illumina whole-genome re-sequencing of the mutant and aligning the reads to Hitomebore reference sequence within the candidate region delineated by linkage analysis identified a G to A nucleotide substitution. The mutation corresponded to the exon-intron splicing junction of a novel gene that encodes a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase domain and two double stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBM) containing protein. By PCR amplification, we confirmed that the mutation causes splicing error that is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon. RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic lines with suppressed expression of LMS gene exhibited the lesion mimic phenotype, confirming that the mutation identified in LMS is responsible for the mutant phenotype. OsLMS shares a moderate amino-acid similarity to the Arabidopsis FIERY2/CPL1 gene, which is known to control many plant processes such as stress response and development. Consistence with this similarity, the lms mutant shows sensitivity to cold stress at the early growth stage, suggesting that LMS is a negative regulator of stress response in rice.",rice oryza sativa l lesion mimic senescence lm emsmutant identified japonica cultivar hitomebore characterized spontaneous lesion mimic phenotype vegetative growth accelerated senescence flowering enhanced resistance rice blast magnaporthe oryzae isolate oslms gene crossed lm mutant kasalath indica used mutant f plant initially map candidate region kb long arm chromosome illumina wholegenome resequencing mutant aligning read hitomebore reference sequence within candidate region delineated linkage analysis identified g nucleotide substitution mutation corresponded exonintron splicing junction novel gene encodes carboxylterminal domain ctd phosphatase domain two double stranded rna binding motif dsrbm containing protein pcr amplification confirmed mutation cause splicing error predicted introduce premature stop codon rna interference rnai transgenic line suppressed expression lm gene exhibited lesion mimic phenotype confirming mutation identified lm responsible mutant phenotype oslms share moderate aminoacid similarity arabidopsis fierycpl gene known control many plant process stress response development consistence similarity lm mutant show sensitivity cold stress early growth stage suggesting lm negative regulator stress response rice,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",12
22992000,Gibberellin 20-oxidase gene OsGA20ox3 regulates plant stature and disease development in rice.,"Gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase (GA20ox) catalyses consecutive steps of oxidation in the late part of the GA biosynthetic pathway. A T-DNA insertion mutant (17S-14) in rice, with an elongated phenotype, was isolated. Analysis of the flanking sequences of the T-DNA insertion site revealed that an incomplete T-DNA integration resulted in enhanced constitutively expression of downstream OsGA20ox3 in the mutant. The accumulation of bioactive GA(1) and GA(4) were increased in the mutant in comparison with the wild-type plant. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsGA20ox3 showed phenotypes similar to those of the 17S-14 mutant, and the RNA interference (RNAi) lines that had decreased OsGA20ox3 expression exhibited a semidwarf phenotype. Expression of OsGA20ox3 was detected in the leaves and roots of young seedlings, immature panicles, anthers, and pollens, based on β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity staining in transgenic plants expressing the OsGA20ox3 promoter fused to the GUS gene. The OsGA20ox3 RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance against rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae (causing rice blast) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (causing bacterial blight) and increased expression of defense-related genes. Conversely, OsGA20ox3-overexpressing plants were more susceptible to these pathogens comparing with the wild-type plants. The susceptibility of wild-type plants to X. oryzae pv. oryzae was increased by exogenous application of GA(3) and decreased by S-3307 treatment.

31923921,iTRAQ proteomics reveals the regulatory response to Magnaporthe oryzae in durable resistant vs. susceptible rice genotypes.,"Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is one of the most serious diseases. Although previous research using two-dimensional gel-based proteomics to assess the proteins related to the rice blast resistance had been done, few proteins were identified. Here, we used the iTRAQ method to detect the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the durable resistant rice variety Gangyuan8 (GY8) and the susceptible rice variety Lijiangxintuanheigu (LTH) in response to M. oryzae invasion, and then transcriptome sequencing was used to assist analysis A total of 193 and 672 DEPs were specifically identified in GY8 and LTH, respectively, with only 46 similarly expressed DEPs being shared by GY8 and LTH.39 DEPs involved in plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, fatty acid metabolism and peroxisome biosynthesis were significantly different between compatible interaction (LTH) and incompatible interaction (GY8). Some proteins participated in peroxide signal transduction and biosynthesis was down-regulated in GY8 but up-regulated in LTH. A lot of genes encoding pathogenesis-related gene (PR), such as chitinase and glucanase, were significantly up-regulated at both the transcriptome and proteome levels at 24 hours post-inoculation in GY8, but up-regulated at the transcriptome level and down-regulated at the proteome level in LTH. Our study reveals that the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity defense system may be activated at the transcriptome level but was inhibited at the protein level in susceptible rice varieties after inoculation.

15564528,Ten rice peroxidases redundantly respond to multiple stresses including infection with rice blast fungus.,"Class III plant peroxidases are believed to function in diverse physiological processes including disease resistance and wound response, but predicted low substrate specificities and the presence of 70 or more isoforms have made it difficult to define a specific physiological function(s) for each gene. To select pathogen-responsive POX genes, we analyzed the expression profiles of 22 rice POX genes after infection with rice blast fungus. The expression of 10 POX genes among the 22 genes was induced after fungal inoculation in both compatible and incompatible hosts. Seven of the 10 POX genes were expressed at higher levels in the incompatible host than in the compatible host 6-24 h after inoculation by which time no fungus-induced lesions have appeared. Organ-specific expression and stress-induced expression by wounding and treatment with probenazole, an agrichemical against blast fungus, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, a precursor of ethylene, indicated that rice POXs have individual characteristics and can be classified into several types. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of POXs showed that multiple isoforms with a high sequence similarity respond to stress in different or similar ways.

39056291,A distinct protein posttranslational modifications-linked OsATL32-OsPPKL2-OsGSK2 loop modulates rice immunity against blast disease.,"Protein posttranslational modifications play crucial roles in plant immunity through modulating a complicated signaling network mediated by different hormones. We previously demonstrated that OsATL32, an ATL-type E3 ligase, negatively contributes to rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we show that OsATL32 forms a loop with OsPPKL2 and OsGSK2 through distinct protein posttranslational modifications to modulate rice immunity. OsATL32 ubiquitinates OsPPKL2, a protein phosphatase with Kelch-like repeat domains that exerts positive roles in regulating rice immunity against M. oryzae and chitin-triggered immune responses, for degradation. The glycogen synthase kinase 2 (OsGSK2), which acts as a negative regulator of rice immunity against M. oryzae and chitin-triggered immune responses, phosphorylates OsATL32 to elevate its protein stability and E3 ligase activity on OsPPKL2. Moreover, OsPPKL2 directly dephosphorylates OsGSK2, affecting its kinase activity on substrates including OsATL32 for phosphorylation. Like OsGSK2 as a BR signaling repressor, OsATL32 negatively regulates BR signaling; conversely, OsPPKL2 plays a positive role in BR signaling. These findings provide a molecular mechanism in which OsATL32 serves as a node connecting BR signaling and immunity by associating with OsPPKL2 and OsGSK2, assembling into a distinct protein posttranslational modifications-linked loop that functions in rice BR signaling and immunity.",protein posttranslational modification play crucial role plant immunity modulating complicated signaling network mediated different hormone previously demonstrated osatl atltype e ligase negatively contributes rice immunity magnaporthe oryzae show osatl form loop osppkl osgsk distinct protein posttranslational modification modulate rice immunity osatl ubiquitinates osppkl protein phosphatase kelchlike repeat domain exerts positive role regulating rice immunity oryzae chitintriggered immune response degradation glycogen synthase kinase osgsk act negative regulator rice immunity oryzae chitintriggered immune response phosphorylates osatl elevate protein stability e ligase activity osppkl moreover osppkl directly dephosphorylates osgsk affecting kinase activity substrate including osatl phosphorylation like osgsk br signaling repressor osatl negatively regulates br signaling conversely osppkl play positive role br signaling finding provide molecular mechanism osatl serf node connecting br signaling immunity associating osppkl osgsk assembling distinct protein posttranslational modificationslinked loop function rice br signaling immunity,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
28142220,"Glutamate synthase MoGlt1-mediated glutamate homeostasis is important for autophagy, virulence and conidiation in the rice blast fungus.","Glutamate homeostasis plays a vital role in central nitrogen metabolism and coordinates several key metabolic functions. However, its function in fungal pathogenesis and development has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we identified and characterized a glutamate synthase gene MoGLT1 in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that was important to glutamate homeostasis. MoGLT1 was constitutively expressed, but showed the highest expression level in appressoria. Deletion of MoGLT1 resulted in a significant reduction in conidiation and virulence. The ΔMoglt1 mutants were defective in appressorial penetration and the differentiation and spread of invasive hyphae in penetrated plant cells. The addition of exogenous glutamic acid partially rescued the defects of the ΔMoglt1 mutants in conidiation and plant infection. Assays for MoAtg8 expression and localization showed that the ΔMoglt1 mutants were defective in autophagy. The ΔMoglt1 mutants were delayed in the mobilization of glycogens and lipid bodies from conidia to developing appressoria.

But the drawback of this line is that it is highly susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) disease of rice caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The present study highlighted the pyramiding of effective BB resistance genes (xa5, xa13 and Xa21) into the background of BRRI31R, through marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC). Backcross progenies were confirmed and advanced based on the foreground selection of target genes. Pyramided lines were used for pathogenicity test against five Bangladeshi Xanthomonas oryzae (BXo) races (BXo93, BXo220, BXo822, BXo826, BXo887) and confirmed the dominant fertility restore genes, Rf3 and Rf4 and further validated against SNP markers for more confirmation of target resistance genes.

39674266,A rice rhizosphere plant growth-promoting Streptomyces corchorusii isolate antagonizes Magnaporthe oryzae and elicits defense responses in rice.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice (Oryza sativa L.). The aim of this study was to investigate the biocontrol potential of rice rhizosphere actinomycetes against M. oryzae Guy 11, and elucidate the antagonistic mechanisms. An isolate characterized as a Streptomyces corchorusii strain (Sc75) using the 16S rRNA gene exhibited superior antifungal activity. Sc75 had an inhibitory effect of 69.25% ± 0.15% against M. oryzae and broad antifungal activity on other fungal plant pathogens in the dual culture assay. Its cell-free culture filtrate inhibited fungal growth and reduced mycelial mass. Also, the ethyl acetate crude extract completely inhibited conidia germination and appressoria formation on the hydrophobic coverslips and detached leaf at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Its volatile organic compounds (VOCs) suppressed fungal growth by 98.42%. GC-MS analysis of the VOCs identified butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, methyl ester; di-tert-butyl peroxide; furan, 2-pentyl-; and undecanoic acid, 10-methyl-, methyl ester as the main components. In the greenhouse experiment, the disease severity was reduced and growth promotion was evident. Molecular investigation revealed that Sc75 upregulated defense-related genes involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid, salicylic acid signaling pathway, and led to callose deposition and ROS production in the leaves. Finally, Sc75 produced hydrolytic enzymes, siderophore, indole acetic acid, gibberellic acid, phosphate solubilization, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase. The rice rhizosphere soil harbors actinomycetes that can be explored as biocontrol agents against fungal pathogens such as M. oryzae. The isolate Sc75 had superior antifungal activity against M. oryzae and other selected plant pathogenic fungi. It showed remarkable antagonistic activity through direct antibiosis, production of VOCs, antifungal metabolites in the culture filtrates and crude extracts, and produced enzymes. In addition, the isolate promoted plant growth, reduced rice blast disease index in the greenhouse experiment, and elicited defense-related responses.

Pathogenicity assays using two avirulent races (IE1k and IB1) and a virulent race (IB54) were performed to verify the resistance responses of accessions. Of the 164 accessions evaluated, 109 contained the Pib gene as determined using both SSR markers and pathogenicity assays, albeit different haplotypes were detected. The remaining 52 germplasm accessions were different in their responses to the blast races IB54, IE1k, and IB1, thus indicating the presence of R gene(s) other than Pib.

33966102,Analysis of natural variation of the rice blast resistance gene Pike and identification of a novel allele Pikg.,"Plant major resistance (R) genes are effective in detecting pathogen signal molecules and triggering robust defense responses. Investigating the natural variation in R genes will allow identification of the critical amino acid residues determining recognition specificity in R protein and the discovery of novel R alleles. The rice blast resistance gene Pike, comprising of two adjacent CC-NBS-LRR genes, namely, Pike-1 and Pike-2, confers broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we demonstrated that Pike-1 determined Pike-specific resistance through direct interaction with the pathogen signal molecule AvrPik. Analysis of natural variation in 79 Pike-1 variants in the Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its wild relatives revealed that the CC and NBS regions, particularly the CC region of the Pike-1 protein were the most diversified. We also found that balancing selection had occurred in O. sativa and O. rufipogon to maintain the genetic diversity of the Pike-1 alleles. By analysis of amino acid sequences, we identified 40 Pike-1 variants in these rice germplasms. These variants were divided into three major groups that corresponded to their respective clades. A new Pike allele, designated Pikg, that differed from Pike by a single amino acid substitution (D229E) in the Pike-1 CC region of the Pike protein was identified from wild rice relatives. Pathogen assays of Pikg transgenic plants revealed a unique reaction pattern that was different from that of the previously identified Pike alleles, namely, Pik, Pikh, Pikm, Pikp, Piks and Pi1. These findings suggest that minor amino acid residues in Pike-1/Pikg-1 determine pathogen recognition specificity and plant resistance. As a new blast R gene derived from rice wild relatives, Pikg has potential applications in rice breeding.",plant major resistance r gene effective detecting pathogen signal molecule triggering robust defense response investigating natural variation r gene allow identification critical amino acid residue determining recognition specificity r protein discovery novel r allele rice blast resistance gene pike comprising two adjacent ccnbslrr gene namely pike pike confers broadspectrum resistance magnaporthe oryzae demonstrated pike determined pikespecific resistance direct interaction pathogen signal molecule avrpik analysis natural variation pike variant asian cultivated rice oryza sativa wild relative revealed cc nb region particularly cc region pike protein diversified also found balancing selection occurred sativa rufipogon maintain genetic diversity pike allele analysis amino acid sequence identified pike variant rice germplasms variant divided three major group corresponded respective clade new pike allele designated pikg differed pike single amino acid substitution de pike cc region pike protein identified wild rice relative pathogen assay pikg transgenic plant revealed unique reaction pattern different previously identified pike allele namely pik pikh pikm pikp piks pi finding suggest minor amino acid residue pikepikg determine pathogen recognition specificity plant resistance new blast r gene derived rice wild relative pikg potential application rice breeding,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['major resistance r gene effective detecting pathogen signal molecule']}",5
24145399,Rapidly evolving R genes in diverse grass species confer resistance to rice blast disease.,"We show that the genomes of maize, sorghum, and brachypodium contain genes that, when transformed into rice, confer resistance to rice blast disease. The genes are resistance genes (R genes) that encode proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains (NBS-LRR proteins). By using criteria associated with rapid molecular evolution, we identified three rapidly evolving R-gene families in these species as well as in rice, and transformed a randomly chosen subset of these genes into rice strains known to be sensitive to rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. The transformed strains were then tested for sensitivity or resistance to 12 diverse strains of M. oryzae. A total of 15 functional blast R genes were identified among 60 NBS-LRR genes cloned from maize, sorghum, and brachypodium; and 13 blast R genes were obtained from 20 NBS-LRR paralogs in rice. These results show that abundant blast R genes occur not only within species but also among species, and that the R genes in the same rapidly evolving gene family can exhibit an effector response that confers resistance to rapidly evolving fungal pathogens. Neither conventional evolutionary conservation nor conventional evolutionary convergence supplies a satisfactory explanation of our findings. We suggest a unique mechanism termed ""constrained divergence,"" in which R genes and pathogen effectors can follow only limited evolutionary pathways to increase fitness.

38542989,In Vitro and Ex Vivo Antifungal Activities of Metconazole against the Rice Blast Fungus <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i>.,"Rice blast, caused by the filamentous fungus <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i>, has long been one of the major threats to almost all rice-growing areas worldwide. Metconazole, 5-(4-chlorobenzyl)-2, 2-dimethyl-1-(1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) cyclopentanol, is a lipophilic, highly active triazole fungicide that has been applied in the control of various fungal pathogens of crops (cereals, barley, wheat), such as the <i>Fusarium</i> and <i>Alternaria</i> species. However, the antifungal activity of metconazole against <i>P. oryzae</i> is unknown. In this study, metconazole exhibited broad spectrum antifungal activities against seven <i>P. oryzae</i> strains collected from rice paddy fields and the wild type strain P131. Scanning electron microscopic analysis and fluorescein diacetate staining assays revealed that metconazole treatment damaged the cell wall integrity, cell membrane permeability and even cell viability of <i>P. oryzae</i>, resulting in deformed and shrunken hyphae. The supplementation of metconazole in vitro increased fungal sensitivity to different stresses, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, congo red, sodium chloride, sorbitol and oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Metconazole could inhibit key virulence processes of <i>P. oryzae</i>, including conidial germination, germ tube elongation and appressorium formation. Furthermore, this chemical prevented <i>P. oryzae</i> from infecting barley epidermal cells by disturbing appressorium penetration and subsequent invasive hyphae development. Pathogenicity assays indicated a reduction of over 75% in the length of blast lesions in both barley and rice leaves when 10 μg/mL of metconazole was applied.

28640974,RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8.1 boosts pattern-triggered immunity against multiple pathogens in Arabidopsis and rice.,"The Arabidopsis gene RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8.1 (RPW8.1) confers resistance to virulent fungal and oomycete pathogens that cause powdery mildew and downy mildew, respectively. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that ectopic expression of RPW8.1 boosts pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) resulting in enhanced resistance against different pathogens in both Arabidopsis and rice. In Arabidopsis, transcriptome analysis revealed that ectopic expression of RPW8.1-YFP constitutively up-regulates expression of many pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP-)-inducible genes. Consistently, upon PAMP application, the transgenic line expressing RPW8.1-YFP exhibited more pronounced PTI responses such as callose deposition, production of reactive oxygen species, expression of defence-related genes and hypersensitive response-like cell death. Accordingly, the growth of a virulent bacterial pathogen was significantly inhibited in the transgenic lines expressing RPW8.1-YFP. Conversely, impairment of the PTI signalling pathway from PAMP cognition to the immediate downstream relay of phosphorylation abolished or significantly compromised RPW8.1-boosted PTI responses. In rice, heterologous expression of RPW8.1-YFP also led to enhanced resistance to the blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) and the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Taken together, our data suggest a surprising mechanistic connection between RPW8.1 function and PTI, and demonstrate the potential of RPW8.1 as a transgene for engineering disease resistance across wide taxonomic lineages of plants.",arabidopsis gene resistance powdery mildew rpw confers resistance virulent fungal oomycete pathogen cause powdery mildew downy mildew respectively however underlying mechanism remains unclear show ectopic expression rpw boost patterntriggered immunity pti resulting enhanced resistance different pathogen arabidopsis rice arabidopsis transcriptome analysis revealed ectopic expression rpwyfp constitutively upregulates expression many pathogenassociated molecular pattern pampinducible gene consistently upon pamp application transgenic line expressing rpwyfp exhibited pronounced pti response callose deposition production reactive oxygen specie expression defencerelated gene hypersensitive responselike cell death accordingly growth virulent bacterial pathogen significantly inhibited transgenic line expressing rpwyfp conversely impairment pti signalling pathway pamp cognition immediate downstream relay phosphorylation abolished significantly compromised rpwboosted pti response rice heterologous expression rpwyfp also led enhanced resistance blast fungus pyricularia oryzae syn magnaporthe oryzae bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo taken together data suggest surprising mechanistic connection rpw function pti demonstrate potential rpw transgene engineering disease resistance across wide taxonomic lineage plant,1,"{'Disease': ['enhanced resistance blast fungus pyricularia oryzae', 'potential rpw transgene engineering disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
17707684,Cellular differentiation and host invasion by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.,"This review describes current advances in understanding the biology of plant infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. Development of the specialized infection structure, the appressorium, in M. grisea has recently been shown to be controlled by cell cycle progression and initiation of autophagic, programmed cell death in the fungal spore. Re-cycling of the contents of the fungal spore and peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation are therefore important processes for appressorium function. Following entry to the host plant, new evidence suggests that M. grisea grows biotrophically within rice cells, bounded by the plant plasmalemma, and the fungus moves from cell-to-cell by means of plasmodesmata. Biotrophic proliferation of the fungus is likely to require secretion of effector proteins and suppression of host defences. Consistent with this, a component of the polarized exocytosis machinery of M. grisea is necessary for pathogenicity and also for induction of host defences in an incompatible interaction. Large-scale insertional mutagenesis is now allowing the rapid analysis of gene function in M. grisea, heralding a new approach to the study of this important fungal pathogen.",review describes current advance understanding biology plant infection rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea development specialized infection structure appressorium grisea recently shown controlled cell cycle progression initiation autophagic programmed cell death fungal spore recycling content fungal spore peroxisomal fatty acid betaoxidation therefore important process appressorium function following entry host plant new evidence suggests grisea grows biotrophically within rice cell bounded plant plasmalemma fungus move celltocell mean plasmodesmata biotrophic proliferation fungus likely require secretion effector protein suppression host defence consistent component polarized exocytosis machinery grisea necessary pathogenicity also induction host defence incompatible interaction largescale insertional mutagenesis allowing rapid analysis gene function grisea heralding new approach study important fungal pathogen,3,"{'Disease': ['current advance understanding biology plant infection rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea development specialized infection structure appressorium grisea', 'plasmodesmata biotrophic proliferation fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['secretion effector protein suppression host defence consistent component polarized exocytosis machinery grisea necessary pathogenicity also induction host defence incompatible interaction largescale insertional mutagenesis']}",9
18943254,"Identification of specific fragments of HpaG Xooc, a harpin from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, that induce disease resistance and enhance growth in plants.","Harpin proteins from gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacteria can stimulate hypersensitive cell death (HCD) and pathogen defense as well as enhance growth in plants. Two of these diverse activities clearly are beneficial and may depend on particular functional regions of the proteins. Identification of beneficial and deleterious regions might facilitate the beneficial use of harpin-related proteins on crops without causing negative effects like cell death. Here, we report the identification and testing of nine functional fragments of HpaG(Xooc), a 137-amino-acid harpin protein from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the pathogen that causes bacterial leaf streak of rice. Polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis generated nine proteinaceous fragments of HpaG(Xooc); these caused different responses following their application to Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and Oryza sativa (rice). Fragment HpaG62-137, which spans the indicated amino acid residues of the HpaG, induced more intense HCD; in contrast, HpaG10-42 did not cause evident cell death in tobacco. However, both fragments stimulated stronger defense responses and enhanced more growth in rice than the full-length parent protein, HpaG(Xooc). Of the nine fragments, the parent protein and one deletion mutant of HpaG(Xooc) tested, HpaG10-42, stimulated higher levels of rice growth and resulted in greater levels of resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae and Magnaporthe grisea. These pathogens cause bacterial leaf blight and rice blast, respectively, the two most important diseases of rice world-wide. HpaG10-42 was more active than HpaG(Xooc) in inducing expression of several genes that regulate rice defense and growth processes and activating certain signaling pathways, which may explain the greater beneficial effects observed from treatment with that fragment. Overall, our results suggest that HpaG10-42 holds promise for practical agricultural use to induce disease resistance and enhance growth of rice.",harpin protein gramnegative plantpathogenic bacteria stimulate hypersensitive cell death hcd pathogen defense well enhance growth plant two diverse activity clearly beneficial may depend particular functional region protein identification beneficial deleterious region might facilitate beneficial use harpinrelated protein crop without causing negative effect like cell death report identification testing nine functional fragment hpagxooc aminoacid harpin protein xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola pathogen cause bacterial leaf streak rice polymerase chain reactionbased mutagenesis generated nine proteinaceous fragment hpagxooc caused different response following application nicotiana tabacum tobacco oryza sativa rice fragment hpag span indicated amino acid residue hpag induced intense hcd contrast hpag cause evident cell death tobacco however fragment stimulated stronger defense response enhanced growth rice fulllength parent protein hpagxooc nine fragment parent protein one deletion mutant hpagxooc tested hpag stimulated higher level rice growth resulted greater level resistance x oryzae pv oryzae magnaporthe grisea pathogen cause bacterial leaf blight rice blast respectively two important disease rice worldwide hpag active hpagxooc inducing expression several gene regulate rice defense growth process activating certain signaling pathway may explain greater beneficial effect observed treatment fragment overall result suggest hpag hold promise practical agricultural use induce disease resistance enhance growth rice,4,"{'Disease': ['two important disease rice worldwide hpag', 'practical agricultural use induce disease resistance enhance growth rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['negative effect', 'greater beneficial effect']}",2
39316277,Silencing Osa-miR827 via CRISPR/Cas9 protects rice against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In plants, miRNAs participate in diverse developmental processes and adaptive responses to biotic and abiotic stress. MiR827 has long been recognized to be involved in plant responses to phosphate starvation. In rice, the miR827 regulates the expression of OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2, these genes encoding vacuolar phosphate transporters. In this study, we demonstrated that miR827 plays a role in resistance to infection by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice. We show that MIR827 overexpression enhances susceptibility to infection by M. oryzae which is associated to a weaker induction of defense gene expression during pathogen infection. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations in the MIR827 gene completely abolish miR827 production and confer resistance to M. oryzae infection. This resistance is accompanied by a reduction of leaf Pi content compared to wild-type plants, whereas Pi levels increase in leaves of the blast-susceptible miR827 overexpressor plants. In wild-type plants, miR827 accumulation in leaves decreases during the biotrophic phase of the infection process. Taken together, our data indicates that silencing MIR827 confers resistance to M. oryzae infection in rice while further supporting interconnections between Pi signaling and immune signaling in plants.

More than 1800 independently regenerated plantlets in seven different populations (for each of the three genes and each of the four gene combinations) were obtained. The ech42 gene encoding for an endochitinase increased resistance to sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani, while the exochitinase-encoding gene, nag70, had lesser effect. The expression level of endochitinase but exochitinase was correlated with disease resistance. Nevertheless, exochitinase enhanced the effect of endochitinase on disease resistance when the two genes co-expressed in transgenics. Resistance to Magnaporthe grisea was found in all kinds of regenerated plants including that with single gluc78. A few lines expressing either ech42 or nag70 gene were immune to the disease.

24964058,Targeted gene disruption of OsCERK1 reveals its indispensable role in chitin perception and involvement in the peptidoglycan response and immunity in rice.,"OsCERK1 is a rice receptor-like kinase that mediates the signal of a fungal cell wall component, chitin, by coordinating with a lysin motif (LysM)-containing protein CEBiP. To further elucidate the function of OsCERK1 in the defense response, we disrupted OsCERK1 using an Agrobacterium-mediated gene targeting system based on homologous recombination. In OsCERK1-disrupted lines, the generation of hydrogen peroxide and the alteration of gene expression in response to a chitin oligomer were completely abolished. The OsCERK1-disrupted lines also showed lowered responsiveness to a bacterial cell wall component, peptidoglycan. Yeast two-hybrid analysis indicated that OsCERK1 interacts with the LysM-containing proteins LYP4 and LYP6, which are known to participate in the peptidoglycan response in rice. Observation of the infection behavior of rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) revealed that disruption of OsCERK1 led to increased hyphal growth in leaf sheath cells. Green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCERK1 was localized around the primary infection hyphae. These results demonstrate that OsCERK1 is indispensable for chitin perception and participates in innate immunity in rice, and also mediates the peptidoglycan response.

We collected in situ images of rice blast and constructed a rice blast dataset based on variations in lesion shape, size, and color. Given that rice blast lesions are small and typically exhibit round, oval, and fusiform shapes, we proposed a small object detection model named GCPDFFNet (global context-based parallel differentiation feature fusion network) for rice blast recognition. The GCPDFFNet model has three global context feature extraction modules and two parallel differentiation feature fusion modules. The global context modules are employed to focus on the lesion areas; the parallel differentiation feature fusion modules are used to enhance the recognition effect of small-sized lesions. In addition, we proposed the SCYLLA normalized Wasserstein distance loss function, specifically designed to accelerate model convergence and improve the detection accuracy of rice blast disease. Comparative experiments were conducted on the rice blast dataset to evaluate the performance of the model. The proposed GCPDFFNet model outperformed the baseline network CenterNet, with a significant increase in mean average precision from 83.6 to 95.4% on the rice blast test set while maintaining a satisfactory frames per second drop from 147.9 to 122.1.

However, the mechanisms underlying NLR-triggered defense responses remain obscure. The recently discovered Pigm locus in rice encodes a cluster of NLRs, including PigmR, which confers broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus. Here, we identify PIBP1 (PigmR-INTERACTING and BLAST RESISTANCE PROTEIN 1), an RRM (RNA-recognition motif) protein that specifically interacts with PigmR and other similar NLRs to trigger blast resistance. PigmR-promoted nuclear accumulation of PIBP1 ensures full blast resistance. We find that PIBP1 and a homolog, Os06 g02240, bind DNA and function as unconventional transcription factors at the promoters of the defense genes OsWAK14 and OsPAL1, activating their expression. Knockout of PIBP1 and Os06 g02240 greatly attenuated blast resistance.

25183458,Transcriptomic dissection of the rice-Burkholderia glumae interaction.,"Bacterial panicle blight caused by the bacterium Burkholderia glumae is an emerging disease of rice in the United States. Not much is known about this disease, the disease cycle or any source of disease resistance. To understand the interaction between rice and Burkholderia glumae, we used transcriptomics via next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) and bioinformatics to identify differentially expressed transcripts between resistant and susceptible interactions and formulate a model for rice resistance to the disease. Using inoculated young seedlings as sample tissues, we identified unique transcripts involved with resistance to bacterial panicle blight, including a PIF-like ORF1 and verified differential expression of some selected genes using qRT-PCR. These transcripts, which include resistance genes of the NBS-LRR type, kinases, transcription factors, transporters and expressed proteins with functions that are not known, have not been reported in other pathosystems including rice blast or bacterial blight. Further, functional annotation analysis reveals enrichment of defense response and programmed cell death (biological processes); ATP and protein binding (molecular functions); and mitochondrion-related (cell component) transcripts in the resistant interaction. Taken together, we formulated a model for rice resistance to bacterial panicle blight that involves an activation of previously unknown resistance genes and their activation partners upon challenge with B. glumae. Other interesting findings are that 1) though these resistance transcripts were up-regulated upon inoculation in the resistant interaction, some of them were already expressed in the water-inoculated control from the resistant genotype, but not in the water- and bacterium-inoculated samples from the susceptible genotype; 2) rice may have co-opted an ORF that was previously a part of a transposable element to aid in the resistance mechanism; and 3) resistance may have existed immediately prior to rice domestication.",bacterial panicle blight caused bacterium burkholderia glumae emerging disease rice united state much known disease disease cycle source disease resistance understand interaction rice burkholderia glumae used transcriptomics via nextgeneration sequencing rnaseq bioinformatics identify differentially expressed transcript resistant susceptible interaction formulate model rice resistance disease using inoculated young seedling sample tissue identified unique transcript involved resistance bacterial panicle blight including piflike orf verified differential expression selected gene using qrtpcr transcript include resistance gene nbslrr type kinase transcription factor transporter expressed protein function known reported pathosystems including rice blast bacterial blight functional annotation analysis reveals enrichment defense response programmed cell death biological process atp protein binding molecular function mitochondrionrelated cell component transcript resistant interaction taken together formulated model rice resistance bacterial panicle blight involves activation previously unknown resistance gene activation partner upon challenge b glumae interesting finding though resistance transcript upregulated upon inoculation resistant interaction already expressed waterinoculated control resistant genotype water bacteriuminoculated sample susceptible genotype rice may coopted orf previously part transposable element aid resistance mechanism resistance may existed immediately prior rice domestication,7,"{'Disease': ['bacterium burkholderia glumae emerging disease rice united state much known disease disease cycle source disease resistance', 'transcript resistant susceptible interaction formulate model rice resistance disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10

While root-secreted SLs are well-known to facilitate plant symbiosis with beneficial microbes, the role of SLs in plant interactions with pathogenic microbes remains largely unexplored. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate a negative role of SLs in rice (Oryza sativa) defense against the blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae). We found that SL biosynthesis and perception mutants, and wild-type (WT) plants after chemical inhibition of SLs, were less susceptible to P. oryzae. Strigolactone deficiency also resulted in a higher accumulation of jasmonates, soluble sugars and flavonoid phytoalexins in rice leaves. Likewise, in response to P. oryzae infection, SL signaling was downregulated, while jasmonate and sugar content increased markedly. The jar1 mutant unable to synthesize jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine, and the coi1-18 RNAi line perturbed in jasmonate signaling, both accumulated lower levels of sugars. However, when WT seedlings were sprayed with glucose or sucrose, jasmonate accumulation increased, suggesting a reciprocal positive interplay between jasmonates and sugars. Finally, we showed that functional jasmonate signaling is necessary for SL deficiency to induce rice defense against P. oryzae. We conclude that a reduction in rice SL content reduces P. oryzae susceptibility by activating jasmonate and sugar signaling pathways, and flavonoid phytoalexin accumulation.",strigolactones sl carotenoidderived phytohormone regulate plant growth development rootsecreted sl wellknown facilitate plant symbiosis beneficial microbe role sl plant interaction pathogenic microbe remains largely unexplored using genetic biochemical approach demonstrate negative role sl rice oryza sativa defense blast fungus pyricularia oryzae syn magnaporthe oryzae found sl biosynthesis perception mutant wildtype wt plant chemical inhibition sl less susceptible p oryzae strigolactone deficiency also resulted higher accumulation jasmonates soluble sugar flavonoid phytoalexins rice leaf likewise response p oryzae infection sl signaling downregulated jasmonate sugar content increased markedly jar mutant unable synthesize jasmonoyllisoleucine coi rnai line perturbed jasmonate signaling accumulated lower level sugar however wt seedling sprayed glucose sucrose jasmonate accumulation increased suggesting reciprocal positive interplay jasmonates sugar finally showed functional jasmonate signaling necessary sl deficiency induce rice defense p oryzae conclude reduction rice sl content reduces p oryzae susceptibility activating jasmonate sugar signaling pathway flavonoid phytoalexin accumulation,4,"{'Disease': ['rice oryza sativa defense blast fungus pyricularia oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",11

Therefore, it is significant to develop a method for sensitive and high-throughput detection of M. grisea in order to help farmers to find and control blast in the early stage. We herein first cloned and expressed the M. grisea's chitinases (Mgchi) and a rice cDNA encoding mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin (Osmbl) with Mgchi-related gene. We demonstrated that Mgchi could be used as a biochemical marker for the detection of M. grisea and there was a specific interaction between Osmbl and Mgchi. Using Mgchi as biochemical marker and Osmbl as recognition probe, we developed a visual method for the specific and sensitive detection of M. grisea based on the PdNPs-catalyzed TMB/H(2)O(2) system. The proposed method could be used to detect Mgchi as low as 7.5×10(-9) M by naked eye observation and 2.5×10(-11) M Mgchi by the micro-plate reader.

36802875,Characterization of Blast Resistance in a Diverse Rice Panel from Sub-Saharan Africa.,"There is a recent unparalleled increase in demand for rice in sub-Saharan Africa, yet its production is affected by blast disease. Characterization of blast resistance in adapted African rice cultivars can provide important information to guide growers and rice breeders. We used molecular markers for known blast resistance genes (<i>Pi</i> genes; <i>n</i> = 21) to group African rice genotypes (<i>n</i> = 240) into similarity clusters. We then used greenhouse-based assays to challenge representative rice genotypes (<i>n</i> = 56) with African isolates (<i>n</i> = 8) of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> which varied in virulence and genetic lineage. The markers grouped rice cultivars into five blast resistance clusters (BRC) which differed in foliar disease severity. Using stepwise regression, we found that the <i>Pi</i> genes associated with reduced blast severity were <i>Pi50</i> and <i>Pi65,</i> whereas <i>Pik-p, Piz-t,</i> and <i>Pik</i> were associated with increased susceptibility. All rice genotypes in the most resistant cluster, BRC 4, possessed <i>Pi50</i> and <i>Pi65</i>, the only genes that were significantly associated with reduced foliar blast severity. Cultivar IRAT109, which contains <i>Piz-t</i>, was resistant against seven African <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates, whereas ARICA 17 was susceptible to eight isolates. The popular Basmati 217 and Basmati 370 were among the most susceptible genotypes. These findings indicate that most tested genes were not effective against African blast pathogen collections. Pyramiding genes in the <i>Pi2/9</i> multifamily blast resistance cluster on chromosome 6 and <i>Pi65</i> on chromosome 11 could confer broad-spectrum resistance capabilities. To gain further insights into genomic regions associated with blast resistance, gene mapping could be conducted with resident blast pathogen collections.

17309686,Functional analysis of rice NPR1-like genes reveals that OsNPR1/NH1 is the rice orthologue conferring disease resistance with enhanced herbivore susceptibility.,"The key regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated resistance, NPR1, is functionally conserved in diverse plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa L.). Investigation in depth is needed to provide an understanding of NPR1-mediated resistance and a practical strategy for the improvement of disease resistance in the model crop rice. The rice genome contains five NPR1-like genes. In our study, three rice homologous genes, OsNPR1/NH1, OsNPR2/NH2 and OsNPR3, were found to be induced by rice bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and rice blast Magnaporthe grisea, and the defence molecules benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate and ethylene. We confirmed that OsNPR1 is the rice orthologue by complementing the Arabidopsis npr1 mutant. Over-expression of OsNPR1 conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants. The OsNPR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm and moved into the nucleus after redox change. Mutations in its conserved cysteine residues led to the constitutive localization of OsNPR1(2CA)-GFP in the nucleus and also abolished herbivore hypersensitivity in transgenic rice. Different subcellular localizations of OsNPR1 antagonistically regulated SA- and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes, but not SA and JA levels, indicating that OsNPR1 might mediate antagonistic cross-talk between the SA- and JA-dependent pathways in rice. This study demonstrates that rice has evolved an SA-mediated systemic acquired resistance similar to that in Arabidopsis, and also provides a practical approach for the improvement of disease resistance without the penalty of decreased herbivore resistance in rice.",key regulator salicylic acid samediated resistance npr functionally conserved diverse plant specie including rice oryza sativa l investigation depth needed provide understanding nprmediated resistance practical strategy improvement disease resistance model crop rice rice genome contains five nprlike gene study three rice homologous gene osnprnh osnprnh osnpr found induced rice bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae rice blast magnaporthe grisea defence molecule benzothiadiazole methyl jasmonate ethylene confirmed osnpr rice orthologue complementing arabidopsis npr mutant overexpression osnpr conferred disease resistance bacterial blight also enhanced herbivore susceptibility transgenic plant osnprgreen fluorescent protein gfp fusion protein localized cytoplasm moved nucleus redox change mutation conserved cysteine residue led constitutive localization osnprcagfp nucleus also abolished herbivore hypersensitivity transgenic rice different subcellular localization osnpr antagonistically regulated sa jasmonic acid jaresponsive gene sa ja level indicating osnpr might mediate antagonistic crosstalk sa jadependent pathway rice study demonstrates rice evolved samediated systemic acquired resistance similar arabidopsis also provides practical approach improvement disease resistance without penalty decreased herbivore resistance rice,4,"{'Disease': ['nprmediated resistance practical strategy improvement disease resistance model crop rice rice genome', 'arabidopsis npr mutant overexpression osnpr conferred disease resistance bacterial blight', 'practical approach improvement disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

To investigate the genome organization of the Pi-ta gene in weedy rice and its relationship to gene flow between cultivated and weedy rice in the US, we analyzed nucleotide sequence variation at the Pi-ta gene and its surrounding 2 Mb region in 156 weedy, domesticated and wild rice relatives. We found that the region at and around the Pi-ta gene shows very low genetic diversity in US weedy rice. The patterns of molecular diversity in weeds are more similar to cultivated rice (indica and aus), which have never been cultivated in the US, rather than the wild rice species, Oryza rufipogon. In addition, the resistant Pi-ta allele (Pi-ta) found in the majority of US weedy rice belongs to the weedy group strawhull awnless (SH), suggesting a single source of origin for Pi-ta. Weeds with Pi-ta were resistant to two M. oryzae races, IC17 and IB49, except for three accessions, suggesting that component(s) required for the Pi-ta mediated resistance may be missing in these accessions. Signatures of flanking sequences of the Pi-ta gene and SSR markers on chromosome 12 suggest that the susceptible pi-ta allele (pi-ta), not Pi-ta, has been introgressed from cultivated to weedy rice by out-crossing.",pita gene rice effectively used control rice blast disease caused magnaporthe oryzae worldwide despite number study reported pita gene domesticated rice wild specie little known pita gene evolved u weedy rice major weed rice investigate genome organization pita gene weedy rice relationship gene flow cultivated weedy rice u analyzed nucleotide sequence variation pita gene surrounding mb region weedy domesticated wild rice relative found region around pita gene show low genetic diversity u weedy rice pattern molecular diversity weed similar cultivated rice indica au never cultivated u rather wild rice specie oryza rufipogon addition resistant pita allele pita found majority u weedy rice belongs weedy group strawhull awnless sh suggesting single source origin pita weed pita resistant two oryzae race ic ib except three accession suggesting component required pita mediated resistance may missing accession signature flanking sequence pita gene ssr marker chromosome suggest susceptible pita allele pita pita introgressed cultivated weedy rice outcrossing,13,"{'Disease': ['control rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",0
23405169,PTS1 peroxisomal import pathway plays shared and distinct roles to PTS2 pathway in development and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Peroxisomes participate in various important metabolisms and are required in pathogenicity of fungal plant pathogens. Peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported from cytoplasm into peroxisomes through peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) or peroxisomal targeting signal 2 (PTS2) import pathway. PEX5 and PEX7 genes participate in the two pathways respectively. The involvement of PEX7 mediated PTS2 import pathway in fungal pathogenicity has been documented, while that of PTS1 remains unclear. Through null mutant analysis of MoPEX5, the PEX5 homolog in Magnaporthe oryzae, we report the crucial roles of PTS1 pathway in the development and host infection in the rice blast fungus, and compared with those of PTS2. We found that MoPEX5 disruption specifically blocked the PTS1 pathway. Δmopex5 was unable to use lipids as sole carbon source and lost pathogenicity completely. Similar as Δmopex7, Δmopex5 exhibited significant reduction in lipid utilization and mobilization, appressorial turgor genesis and H(2)O(2) resistance. Additionally, Δmopex5 presented some distinct defects which were undetected in Δmopex7 in vegetative growth, conidial morphogenesis, appressorial morphogenesis and melanization.

Although endophytic fungi and bacteria associated with rice have been investigated, little is known about the endophytic fungi of wild rice (Oryza granulate) in China. Here we studied the root endophytic mycobiota residing in roots of O. granulate by the use of an integrated approach consisting of microscopy, cultivation, ecological indices, and direct PCR. Microscopy confirmed the ubiquitousness of dark septate endophytes (DSEs) and sclerotium-like structures in root tissues. Isolations from 204 root segments from 15 wild rice plants yielded 58 isolates, for which 31 internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based genotypes were recorded. The best BLAST match indicated that 34.5% of all taxa encountered may represent hitherto undescribed species. Most of the fungi were isolated with a very low frequency. Calculation of ecological indices and estimation of taxon accumulation curves indicated a high diversity of fungal species. A culture-independent approach was also performed to analyze the endophytic fungal community. Three individual clone libraries were constructed. Using a threshold of 90% similarity, 35 potentially different sequences (phylotypes) were found among 186 positive clones. Phylogenetic analysis showed that frequently detected clones were classified as Basidiomycota, and 60.2% of total analyzed clones were affiliated with unknown taxa. Exophiala, Cladophialophora, Harpophora, Periconia macrospinosa, and the Ceratobasidium/Rhizoctonia complex may act as potential DSE groups. A comparison of the fungal communities characterized by the two approaches demonstrated distinctive fungal groups, and only a few taxa overlapped.

20955180,Screening for resistance against Pseudomonas syringae in rice-FOX Arabidopsis lines identified a putative receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene that confers resistance to major bacterial and fungal pathogens in Arabidopsis and rice.,"Approximately 20,000 of the rice-FOX Arabidopsis transgenic lines, which overexpress 13,000 rice full-length cDNAs at random in Arabidopsis, were screened for bacterial disease resistance by dip inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). The identities of the overexpressed genes were determined in 72 lines that showed consistent resistance after three independent screens. Pst DC3000 resistance was verified for 19 genes by characterizing other independent Arabidopsis lines for the same genes in the original rice-FOX hunting population or obtained by reintroducing the genes into ecotype Columbia by floral dip transformation. Thirteen lines of these 72 selections were also resistant to the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. Eight genes that conferred resistance to Pst DC3000 in Arabidopsis have been introduced into rice for overexpression, and transformants were evaluated for resistance to the rice bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. One of the transgenic rice lines was highly resistant to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Interestingly, this line also showed remarkably high resistance to Magnaporthe grisea, the fungal pathogen causing rice blast, which is the most devastating rice disease in many countries. The causal rice gene, encoding a putative receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, was therefore designated as BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1.

27457988,Tissue-specific expression of Arabidopsis NPR1 gene in rice for sheath blight resistance without compromising phenotypic cost.,"Rice sheath blight disease, caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is considered the second most important disease of rice after blast. NPR1 (non expressor of PR1) is the central regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) conferring broad spectrum resistance to various pathogens. Previous reports have indicated that constitutive expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 (AtNPR1) gene results in disease resistance in rice but has a negative impact on growth and agronomic traits. Here, we report that green tissue-specific expression of AtNPR1 in rice confers resistance to the sheath blight pathogen, with no concomitant abnormalities in plant growth and yield parameters. Elevated levels of NPR1 activated the defence pathway in the transgenic plants by inducing expression of endogenous genes such as PR1b, RC24, and PR10A. Enhanced sheath blight resistance of the transgenic plants was evaluated using three different bioassay systems. A partially isolated toxin from R. solani was used in the bioassays to measure the resistance level. Studies of the phenotype and yield showed that the transgenic plants did not exhibit any kind of phenotypic imbalances. Our results demonstrate that green tissue-specific expression of AtNPR1 is an effective strategy for controlling the sheath blight pathogen.

24173912,CEBiP is the major chitin oligomer-binding protein in rice and plays a main role in the perception of chitin oligomers.,"CEBiP, a plasma membrane-localized glycoprotein of rice, directly binds with chitin elicitors (CE), and has been identified as a receptor for CE by using CEBiP-RNAi rice cells. To further clarify the function of CEBiP, we produced CEBiP-disrupted rice plants by applying an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated gene-targeting system based on homologous recombination, which has recently been developed for rice. Homologous recombination occurred at the CEBiP locus in ~0.5 % of the positive/negative selected calli. In the self-pollinated next generation, it was confirmed that the first exon of CEBiP was replaced with the hygromycin selection cassette as designed, and that the expression of CEBiP was completely deficient in homozygous cebip lines. Affinity-labeling analysis using biotinylated N-acetylchitooctaose demonstrated that CEBiP is the major CE-binding protein in rice cultured cells and leaves, which was consistent with the result that the response to CE in cebip cells was greatly diminished. Nevertheless, we observed a significant decrease in disease resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease, only when the cebip leaf sheaths were inoculated with a weakly virulent strain, suggesting that CE perception during the infection process of M. oryzae is limited. The response to peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides in cebip cells was not affected, strongly suggesting that CEBiP is a CE-specific receptor.",cebip plasma membranelocalized glycoprotein rice directly bind chitin elicitors ce identified receptor ce using cebiprnai rice cell clarify function cebip produced cebipdisrupted rice plant applying efficient agrobacteriummediated genetargeting system based homologous recombination recently developed rice homologous recombination occurred cebip locus positivenegative selected callus selfpollinated next generation confirmed first exon cebip replaced hygromycin selection cassette designed expression cebip completely deficient homozygous cebip line affinitylabeling analysis using biotinylated nacetylchitooctaose demonstrated cebip major cebinding protein rice cultured cell leaf consistent result response ce cebip cell greatly diminished nevertheless observed significant decrease disease resistance magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease cebip leaf sheath inoculated weakly virulent strain suggesting ce perception infection process oryzae limited response peptidoglycan lipopolysaccharides cebip cell affected strongly suggesting cebip cespecific receptor,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
24725999,Rapid evolution of avirulence genes in rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating pathogens in rice. Avirulence genes in this fungus share a gene-for-gene relationship with the resistance genes in its host rice. Although numerous studies have shown that rice blast R-genes are extremely diverse and evolve rapidly in their host populations, little is known about the evolutionary patterns of the Avr-genes in the pathogens. Here, six well-characterized Avr-genes and seven randomly selected non-Avr control genes were used to investigate the genetic variations in 62 rice blast strains from different parts of China. Frequent presence/absence polymorphisms, high levels of nucleotide variation (~10-fold higher than non-Avr genes), high non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratios, and frequent shared non-synonymous substitution were observed in the Avr-genes of these diversified blast strains. In addition, most Avr-genes are closely associated with diverse repeated sequences, which may partially explain the frequent presence/absence polymorphisms in Avr-genes. The frequent deletion and gain of Avr-genes and rapid non-synonymous variations might be the primary mechanisms underlying rapid adaptive evolution of pathogens toward virulence to their host plants, and these features can be used as the indicators for identifying additional Avr-genes. The high number of nucleotide polymorphisms among Avr-gene alleles could also be used to distinguish genetic groups among different strains.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating pathogen rice avirulence gene fungus share geneforgene relationship resistance gene host rice although numerous study shown rice blast rgenes extremely diverse evolve rapidly host population little known evolutionary pattern avrgenes pathogen six wellcharacterized avrgenes seven randomly selected nonavr control gene used investigate genetic variation rice blast strain different part china frequent presenceabsence polymorphism high level nucleotide variation fold higher nonavr gene high nonsynonymous synonymous substitution ratio frequent shared nonsynonymous substitution observed avrgenes diversified blast strain addition avrgenes closely associated diverse repeated sequence may partially explain frequent presenceabsence polymorphism avrgenes frequent deletion gain avrgenes rapid nonsynonymous variation might primary mechanism underlying rapid adaptive evolution pathogen toward virulence host plant feature used indicator identifying additional avrgenes high number nucleotide polymorphism among avrgene allele could also used distinguish genetic group among different strain,13,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe', 'one devastating pathogen rice avirulence gene fungus share geneforgene relationship resistance gene host rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
24949933,FAR1 and FAR2 regulate the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae causes plant disease via specialised infection structures called appressoria. These dome-shaped cells are able to generate enormous internal pressure, which enables penetration of rice tissue by invasive hyphae. Previous studies have shown that mobilisation of lipid bodies and subsequent lipid metabolism are essential pre-requisites for successful appressorium-mediated plant infection, which requires autophagic recycling of the contents of germinated spores and germ tubes to the developing appressorium. Here, we set out to identify putative regulators of lipid metabolism in the rice blast fungus. We report the identification of FAR1 and FAR2, which encode highly conserved members of the Zn2-Cys6 family of transcriptional regulators. We generated Δfar1, Δfar2 and Δfar1Δfar2 double mutants in M. oryzae and show that these deletion mutants are deficient in growth on long chain fatty acids. In addition, Δfar2 mutants are also unable to grow on acetate and short chain fatty acids. FAR1 and FAR2 are necessary for differential expression of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, acetyl-CoA translocation, peroxisomal biogenesis, and the glyoxylate cycle in response to the presence of lipids. Furthermore, FAR2 is necessary for expression of genes associated with acetyl-CoA synthesis. Interestingly, Δfar1, Δfar2 and Δfar1Δfar2 mutants show no observable delay or reduction in lipid body mobilisation during plant infection, suggesting that these transcriptional regulators control lipid substrate utilization by the fungus but not the mobilisation of intracellular lipid reserves during infection-related morphogenesis.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae cause plant disease via specialised infection structure called appressoria domeshaped cell able generate enormous internal pressure enables penetration rice tissue invasive hypha previous study shown mobilisation lipid body subsequent lipid metabolism essential prerequisite successful appressoriummediated plant infection requires autophagic recycling content germinated spore germ tube developing appressorium set identify putative regulator lipid metabolism rice blast fungus report identification far far encode highly conserved member zncys family transcriptional regulator generated δfar δfar δfarδfar double mutant oryzae show deletion mutant deficient growth long chain fatty acid addition δfar mutant also unable grow acetate short chain fatty acid far far necessary differential expression gene involved fatty acid βoxidation acetylcoa translocation peroxisomal biogenesis glyoxylate cycle response presence lipid furthermore far necessary expression gene associated acetylcoa synthesis interestingly δfar δfar δfarδfar mutant show observable delay reduction lipid body mobilisation plant infection suggesting transcriptional regulator control lipid substrate utilization fungus mobilisation intracellular lipid reserve infectionrelated morphogenesis,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe', 'putative regulator lipid metabolism rice blast fungus report identification', 'transcriptional regulator control lipid substrate utilization fungus mobilisation intracellular lipid reserve'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

An association study was performed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with virulence genes using 831 selected SNP and infection phenotypes on local and improved rice varieties. Population structure analysis revealed eight subpopulations. The division into eight groups was not related to the degree of virulence.

32931489,The rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 initiates cell death through receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation.,"Plant NLR immune receptors are multidomain proteins that can function as specialized sensor/helper pairs. Paired NLR immune receptors are generally thought to function via negative regulation, where one NLR represses the activity of the second and detection of pathogen effectors relieves this repression to initiate immunity. However, whether this mechanism is common to all NLR pairs is not known. Here, we show that the rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2, which confers resistance to strains of the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae) expressing the AVR-PikD effector, functions via receptor cooperation, with effector-triggered activation requiring both NLRs to trigger the immune response. To investigate the mechanism of Pikp-1/Pikp-2 activation, we expressed truncated variants of these proteins, and made mutations in previously identified NLR sequence motifs. We found that any domain truncation, in either Pikp-1 or Pikp-2, prevented cell death in the presence of AVR-PikD, revealing that all domains are required for activity. Further, expression of individual Pikp-1 or Pikp-2 domains did not result in cell death. Mutations in the conserved P-loop and MHD sequence motifs in both Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 prevented cell death activation, demonstrating that these motifs are required for the function of the two partner NLRs. Finally, we showed that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 associate to form homo- and hetero-complexes in planta in the absence of AVR-PikD; on co-expression the effector binds to Pikp-1 generating a tri-partite complex. Taken together, we provide evidence that Pikp-1 and Pikp-2 form a fine-tuned system that is activated by AVR-PikD via receptor cooperation rather than negative regulation.",plant nlr immune receptor multidomain protein function specialized sensorhelper pair paired nlr immune receptor generally thought function via negative regulation one nlr represses activity second detection pathogen effector relief repression initiate immunity however whether mechanism common nlr pair known show rice nlr pair pikppikp confers resistance strain blast pathogen magnaporthe oryzae syn pyricularia oryzae expressing avrpikd effector function via receptor cooperation effectortriggered activation requiring nlrs trigger immune response investigate mechanism pikppikp activation expressed truncated variant protein made mutation previously identified nlr sequence motif found domain truncation either pikp pikp prevented cell death presence avrpikd revealing domain required activity expression individual pikp pikp domain result cell death mutation conserved ploop mhd sequence motif pikp pikp prevented cell death activation demonstrating motif required function two partner nlrs finally showed pikp pikp associate form homo heterocomplexes planta absence avrpikd coexpression effector bind pikp generating tripartite complex taken together provide evidence pikp pikp form finetuned system activated avrpikd via receptor cooperation rather negative regulation,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['second detection pathogen effector relief repression initiate immunity', 'avrpikd effector function', 'receptor cooperation effectortriggered activation', 'coexpression effector']}",5

In the current study, an alkalescent nucleoside antibiotic was mixed with zinc hexanitrate to fabricate the ZnONPs. An integrated approach of DIAION HP-20 macroporous resin and sephadex LH-20 column chromatography was adopted to separate and purify alkalescent nucleoside AN03 from <i>Streptomyces koyanogensis</i>. Alkalescent nucleoside was confirmed by the Doskochilova solvent system. The bio-fabricated ZnONPs were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The XRD spectrum and the TEM images confirmed the crystallinity and the spherical shape of the ZnONPs with an average size of 22 nm. FTIR analysis showed the presence of functional groups, which confirmed the bio-fabrication of ZnONPs from alkalescent nucleoside ANO3. In-vitro studies showed that 75 μg/mL of ZnONPs had a strong inhibitory zone (28.39 mm) against the <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> and significantly suppressed the spore germination.

38803114,Multiplex-genome-editing based rapid directional improvement of complex traits in rice.,"Although thousands of genes have been identified or cloned in rice (Oryza sativa) in the last two decades, the majority of them have only been separately characterized in specific varieties or single-gene modified backgrounds, thus limiting their practical application. We developed an optimized multiplex genome editing (MGE) toolbox that can efficiently assemble and stably express up to twelve sgRNA targets in a single plant expression vector. In this study, we established the MGE-based Rapid Directional Improvement (MRDI) strategy for directional improvement of complex agronomic traits in one small-scale rice transformation. This approach provides a rapid and practical procedure, encompassing sgRNA assembly, transgene-free screening and the creation of promising germplasm, by combining the precision of gene editing with phenotype-based field breeding. The MRDI strategy was used to generate the full diversity of twelve main agronomic genes in rice cultivar FXZ for the directional improvement of its growth duration and plant architecture. After applying the MRDI to FXZ, ideal plants with the desired traits of early heading date reduced plant height, and more effective panicles were generated without compromising yield, blast resistance and grain quality. Furthermore, the results of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), including the analysis of structural variations (SVs) and single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the MGE plants, confirmed the high specificity and low frequency of unwanted mutations associated with this strategy.

27126515,Magnaporthe oryzae Effector AVR-Pii Helps to Establish Compatibility by Inhibition of the Rice NADP-Malic Enzyme Resulting in Disruption of Oxidative Burst and Host Innate Immunity.,"Plant disease resistance occurs as a hypersensitive response (HR) at the site of attempted pathogen invasion. This specific event is initiated in response to recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and subsequent PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Both PTI and ETI mechanisms are tightly connected with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and disease resistance that involves distinct biphasic ROS production as one of its pivotal plant immune responses. This unique oxidative burst is strongly dependent on the resistant cultivars because a monophasic ROS burst is a hallmark of the susceptible cultivars. However, the cause of the differential ROS burst remains unknown. In the study here, we revealed the plausible underlying mechanism of the differential ROS burst through functional understanding of the Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) AVR effector, AVR-Pii. We performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening using AVR-Pii as bait and isolated rice NADP-malic enzyme2 (Os-NADP-ME2) as the rice target protein. To our surprise, deletion of the rice Os-NADP-ME2 gene in a resistant rice cultivar disrupted innate immunity against the rice blast fungus. Malic enzyme activity and inhibition studies demonstrated that AVR-Pii proteins specifically inhibit in vitro NADP-ME activity. Overall, we demonstrate that rice blast fungus, M. oryzae attenuates the host ROS burst via AVR-Pii-mediated inhibition of Os-NADP-ME2, which is indispensable in ROS metabolism for the innate immunity of rice. This characterization of the regulation of the host oxidative burst will help to elucidate how the products of AVR genes function associated with virulence of the pathogen.",plant disease resistance occurs hypersensitive response hr site attempted pathogen invasion specific event initiated response recognition pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamp subsequent pamptriggered immunity pti effectortriggered immunity eti pti eti mechanism tightly connected reactive oxygen specie ro production disease resistance involves distinct biphasic ro production one pivotal plant immune response unique oxidative burst strongly dependent resistant cultivar monophasic ro burst hallmark susceptible cultivar however cause differential ro burst remains unknown study revealed plausible underlying mechanism differential ro burst functional understanding magnaporthe oryzae oryzae avr effector avrpii performed yeast twohybrid yh screening using avrpii bait isolated rice nadpmalic enzyme osnadpme rice target protein surprise deletion rice osnadpme gene resistant rice cultivar disrupted innate immunity rice blast fungus malic enzyme activity inhibition study demonstrated avrpii protein specifically inhibit vitro nadpme activity overall demonstrate rice blast fungus oryzae attenuates host ro burst via avrpiimediated inhibition osnadpme indispensable ro metabolism innate immunity rice characterization regulation host oxidative burst help elucidate product avr gene function associated virulence pathogen,1,"{'Disease': ['plant disease resistance', 'production disease resistance', 'immunity rice blast fungus malic enzyme activity inhibition study', 'demonstrate rice blast fungus oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['magnaporthe oryzae oryzae avr effector avrpii']}",7

Application of host resistance to these pathogens is the most economical and environment-friendly approach to solve this problem. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling quantitative resistance are valuable sources for broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance. Although large numbers of QTLs for bacterial blight and blast resistance have been identified, these sources have not been used effectively in rice improvement because of the complex genetic control of quantitative resistance and because the genes underlying resistance QTLs are unknown. To isolate disease resistance QTLs, we established a candidate gene strategy that integrates linkage map, expression profile, and functional complementation analyses. This strategy has proven to be applicable for identifying the genes underlying minor resistance QTLs in rice-Xoo and rice-M. grisea systems and it may also help to shed light on disease resistance QTLs of other cereals. Our results also suggest that a single minor QTL can be used in rice improvement by modulating the expression of the gene underlying the QTL.

18373976,Enhancement of disease resistance to Magnaporthe grisea in rice by accumulation of hydroxy linoleic acid.,"Linoleic acid (18:2) and linolenic acid (18:3) are sources for various oxidized metabolites called oxylipins, some of which inhibit growth of fungal pathogens. In a previous study, we found disease resistance to rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea enhanced in 18:2-accumulating transgenic rice (F78Ri) in which the conversion from 18:2 to 18:3 was suppressed. Here, we demonstrate that 18:2-derived hydroperoxides and hydroxides (HPODEs and HODEs, respectively) inhibit growth of M. grisea more strongly than their 18:3-derived counterparts. Furthermore, in F78Ri plants, the endogenous levels of HPODEs and HODEs increased significantly, compared with wild-type plants. These results suggest that the increased accumulation of antifungal oxylipins, such as HPODEs and HODEs, causes the enhancement of disease resistance against M. grisea.",linoleic acid linolenic acid source various oxidized metabolite called oxylipins inhibit growth fungal pathogen previous study found disease resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea enhanced accumulating transgenic rice fri conversion suppressed demonstrate derived hydroperoxides hydroxide hpodes hodes respectively inhibit growth grisea strongly derived counterpart furthermore fri plant endogenous level hpodes hodes increased significantly compared wildtype plant result suggest increased accumulation antifungal oxylipins hpodes hodes cause enhancement disease resistance grisea,4,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance rice blast fungus magnaporthe', 'enhancement disease resistance grisea'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
31218796,Mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy are necessary for proper invasive growth in rice blast.,"Magnaporthe oryzae causes blast disease, which is one of the most devastating infections in rice and several important cereal crops. Magnaporthe oryzae needs to coordinate gene regulation, morphological changes, nutrient acquisition and host evasion in order to invade and proliferate within the plant tissues. Thus far, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of invasive growth in planta have remained largely unknown. We identified a precise filamentous-punctate-filamentous cycle in mitochondrial morphology during Magnaporthe-rice interaction. Interestingly, disruption of such mitochondrial dynamics by deletion of genes regulating either the mitochondrial fusion (MoFzo1) or fission (MoDnm1) machinery, or inhibition of mitochondrial fission using Mdivi-1 caused significant reduction in M. oryzae pathogenicity. Furthermore, exogenous carbon source(s) but not antioxidant treatment delayed such mitochondrial dynamics/transition during invasive growth. In contrast, carbon starvation induced the breakdown of the mitochondrial network and led to more punctate mitochondria in vitro. Such nutrient-based regulation of organellar dynamics preceded MoAtg24-mediated mitophagy, which was found to be essential for proper biotrophic development and invasive growth in planta. We propose that precise mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy occur during the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy and are required for proper induction and establishment of the blast disease in rice.",magnaporthe oryzae cause blast disease one devastating infection rice several important cereal crop magnaporthe oryzae need coordinate gene regulation morphological change nutrient acquisition host evasion order invade proliferate within plant tissue thus far molecular mechanism underlying regulation invasive growth planta remained largely unknown identified precise filamentouspunctatefilamentous cycle mitochondrial morphology magnaportherice interaction interestingly disruption mitochondrial dynamic deletion gene regulating either mitochondrial fusion mofzo fission modnm machinery inhibition mitochondrial fission using mdivi caused significant reduction oryzae pathogenicity furthermore exogenous carbon source antioxidant treatment delayed mitochondrial dynamicstransition invasive growth contrast carbon starvation induced breakdown mitochondrial network led punctate mitochondrion vitro nutrientbased regulation organellar dynamic preceded moatgmediated mitophagy found essential proper biotrophic development invasive growth planta propose precise mitochondrial dynamic mitophagy occur transition biotrophy necrotrophy required proper induction establishment blast disease rice,3,"{'Disease': ['blast disease', 'proper induction establishment blast disease rice'], 'Treatment': ['significant reduction oryzae pathogenicity furthermore exogenous carbon source antioxidant treatment delayed mitochondrial dynamicstransition invasive growth contrast carbon starvation'], 'Symptom': []}",9
20639448,Spatial uncoupling of mitosis and cytokinesis during appressorium-mediated plant infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"To infect plants, many pathogenic fungi develop specialized infection structures called appressoria. Here, we report that appressorium development in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae involves an unusual cell division, in which nuclear division is spatially uncoupled from the site of cytokinesis and septum formation. The position of the appressorium septum is defined prior to mitosis by formation of a heteromeric septin ring complex, which was visualized by spatial localization of Septin4:green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Septin5:GFP fusion proteins. Mitosis in the fungal germ tube is followed by long-distance nuclear migration and rapid formation of an actomyosin contractile ring in the neck of the developing appressorium, at a position previously marked by the septin complex. By contrast, mutants impaired in appressorium development, such as Deltapmk1 and DeltacpkA regulatory mutants, undergo coupled mitosis and cytokinesis within the germ tube. Perturbation of the spatial control of septation, by conditional mutation of the SEPTATION-ASSOCIATED1 gene of M. oryzae, prevented the fungus from causing rice blast disease. Overexpression of SEP1 did not affect septation during appressorium formation, but instead led to decoupling of nuclear division and cytokinesis in nongerminated conidial cells. When considered together, these results indicate that SEP1 is essential for determining the position and frequency of cell division sites in M. oryzae and demonstrate that differentiation of appressoria requires a cytokinetic event that is distinct from cell divisions within hyphae.",infect plant many pathogenic fungi develop specialized infection structure called appressoria report appressorium development rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae involves unusual cell division nuclear division spatially uncoupled site cytokinesis septum formation position appressorium septum defined prior mitosis formation heteromeric septin ring complex visualized spatial localization septingreen fluorescent protein gfp septingfp fusion protein mitosis fungal germ tube followed longdistance nuclear migration rapid formation actomyosin contractile ring neck developing appressorium position previously marked septin complex contrast mutant impaired appressorium development deltapmk deltacpka regulatory mutant undergo coupled mitosis cytokinesis within germ tube perturbation spatial control septation conditional mutation septationassociated gene oryzae prevented fungus causing rice blast disease overexpression sep affect septation appressorium formation instead led decoupling nuclear division cytokinesis nongerminated conidial cell considered together result indicate sep essential determining position frequency cell division site oryzae demonstrate differentiation appressoria requires cytokinetic event distinct cell division within hypha,3,"{'Disease': ['appressorium development rice blast fungus', 'fungus', 'rice blast disease overexpression'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
29615506,Coexistence of Multiple Endemic and Pandemic Lineages of the Rice Blast Pathogen.,"The rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (syn., <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i>) is both a threat to global food security and a model for plant pathology. Molecular pathologists need an accurate understanding of the origins and line of descent of <i>M. oryzae</i> populations in order to identify the genetic and functional bases of pathogen adaptation and to guide the development of more effective control strategies. We used a whole-genome sequence analysis of samples from different times and places to infer details about the genetic makeup of <i>M. oryzae</i> from a global collection of isolates. Analyses of population structure identified six lineages within <i>M. oryzae</i>, including two pandemic on japonica and indica rice, respectively, and four lineages with more restricted distributions. Tip-dating calibration indicated that <i>M. oryzae</i> lineages separated about a millennium ago, long after the initial domestication of rice. The major lineage endemic to continental Southeast Asia displayed signatures of sexual recombination and evidence of DNA acquisition from multiple lineages. Tests for weak natural selection revealed that the pandemic spread of clonal lineages entailed an evolutionary ""cost,"" in terms of the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Our findings reveal the coexistence of multiple endemic and pandemic lineages with contrasting population and genetic characteristics within a widely distributed pathogen.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (syn., <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i>) is a textbook example of a rapidly adapting pathogen, and it is responsible for one of the most damaging diseases of rice.

12168952,Quantitative trait loci associated with leaf and neck blast resistance in recombinant inbred line population of rice (Oryza sativa).,"Blast is an economically important disease of rice. To map genes controlling blast resistance, recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were developed from Khao Dawk Mali 105, an aromatic, blast-susceptible cultivar and the blast resistance donor, CT 9993-5-10-M (CT). A linkage map encompassing 2112 cM was constructed from 141 RILs using 90 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and 31 simple sequence repeats (SSR). Virulent isolates of blast fungus were identified by screening differential host sets against 87 single-spore isolates collected from the north and northeast of Thailand. Fifteen virulent blast isolates were selected for leaf blast screening. Neck blast was evaluated both under natural conditions and controlled inoculations. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for broad resistance spectrum (BRS) to leaf blast were located on chromosomes 7 and 9. In particular, the QTL(ch9) was mapped near the Pi5(t) locus. The QTL(ch7) was located close to a previously mapped partial resistance QTL. Both loci showed significant allelic interaction. Genotypes having CT alleles at both QTL(ch7) and QTL(ch9) were the most resistant. Two neck-blast QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 5 and 6. The inconsistent map locations between the leaf and neck blast QTLs indicate the complexity of fixing both leaf and neck blast resistance. The coincidence of BRS and field resistance QTLs on chromosome 7 supports the idea that BRS may reflect the broad resistance spectrum to leaf blast in rice. These findings laid the foundation for the development of a marker-assisted scheme for improving Khoa Dawk Mali 105 and the majority of aromatic Thai rice varieties that are susceptible to blast.",blast economically important disease rice map gene controlling blast resistance recombinant inbred line ril developed khao dawk mali aromatic blastsusceptible cultivar blast resistance donor ct ct linkage map encompassing cm constructed rils using restriction fragment length polymorphism rflps simple sequence repeat ssr virulent isolates blast fungus identified screening differential host set singlespore isolates collected north northeast thailand fifteen virulent blast isolates selected leaf blast screening neck blast evaluated natural condition controlled inoculation quantitative trait locus qtls broad resistance spectrum br leaf blast located chromosome particular qtlch mapped near pit locus qtlch located close previously mapped partial resistance qtl locus showed significant allelic interaction genotype ct allele qtlch qtlch resistant two neckblast qtls mapped chromosome inconsistent map location leaf neck blast qtls indicate complexity fixing leaf neck blast resistance coincidence br field resistance qtls chromosome support idea br may reflect broad resistance spectrum leaf blast rice finding laid foundation development markerassisted scheme improving khoa dawk mali majority aromatic thai rice variety susceptible blast,2,"{'Disease': ['blast economically important disease rice map gene controlling blast resistance recombinant inbred line ril developed khao', 'blast fungus identified screening differential host'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
18723578,RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex.,"A small GTPase, Rac1, plays a key role in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity as part of a complex of regulatory proteins. Here, we used affinity column chromatography to identify rice RACK1 (for Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1) as an interactor with Rac1. RACK1 functions in various mammalian signaling pathways and is involved in hormone signaling and development in plants. Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1. Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. RACK1A transcription was also induced by a fungal elicitor and by abscisic acid, jasmonate, and auxin. Analysis of transgenic rice plants and cell cultures indicates that RACK1A plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in resistance against rice blast infection. Overexpression of RACK1A enhances ROS production in rice seedlings. RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance.

1980141,Genetic mapping with dispersed repeated sequences in the rice blast fungus: mapping the SMO locus.,"The SMO genetic locus in strains of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea that infect weeping lovegrass, directs the formation of correct cell shapes in asexual spores, infection structures, and asci. We have identified and characterized a Smo- strain of M. grisea that infects rice. The smo mutation in this strain segregates as a single gene mutation and is allelic to previously identified smo alleles. A marked reduction in pathogenicity co-segregates with the Smo- phenotype, suggesting that the SMO locus plays a role in rice pathogenicity. A family of dispersed repeated DNA sequences, called MGR, have been discovered in the nuclear DNA of M. grisea rice pathogens. Genetic crosses between Smo- rice pathogens and Smo+ non-rice pathogens were used to follow the segregation of the SMO locus and individual MGR sequences. Using DNA blot analysis with cloned MGR hybridization probes, we mapped the SMO locus to a chromosomal region flanked by two closely linked MGR sequences. We demonstrated that the copy number of MGR sequences could be reduced in subsequent crosses to non-rice pathogens of M. grisea, and that new MGR sequences did not occur following meiosis indicating that these sequences are stable in the genome. We conclude that restriction fragment polymorphism mapping with cloned MGR sequences as hybridization probes is an effective way to map genes in the rice blast fungus.",smo genetic locus strain fungus magnaporthe grisea infect weeping lovegrass directs formation correct cell shape asexual spore infection structure ascus identified characterized smo strain grisea infects rice smo mutation strain segregate single gene mutation allelic previously identified smo allele marked reduction pathogenicity cosegregates smo phenotype suggesting smo locus play role rice pathogenicity family dispersed repeated dna sequence called mgr discovered nuclear dna grisea rice pathogen genetic cross smo rice pathogen smo nonrice pathogen used follow segregation smo locus individual mgr sequence using dna blot analysis cloned mgr hybridization probe mapped smo locus chromosomal region flanked two closely linked mgr sequence demonstrated copy number mgr sequence could reduced subsequent cross nonrice pathogen grisea new mgr sequence occur following meiosis indicating sequence stable genome conclude restriction fragment polymorphism mapping cloned mgr sequence hybridization probe effective way map gene rice blast fungus,8,"{'Disease': ['mgr sequence hybridization probe effective way map gene rice blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['mgr sequence hybridization probe effective way map gene rice blast fungus']}",9

23774898,Two distinct secretion systems facilitate tissue invasion by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"To cause plant diseases, pathogenic micro-organisms secrete effector proteins into host tissue to suppress immunity and support pathogen growth. Bacterial pathogens have evolved several distinct secretion systems to target effector proteins, but whether fungi, which cause the major diseases of most crop species, also require different secretory mechanisms is not known. Here we report that the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae possesses two distinct secretion systems to target effectors during plant infection. Cytoplasmic effectors, which are delivered into host cells, preferentially accumulate in the biotrophic interfacial complex, a novel plant membrane-rich structure associated with invasive hyphae. We show that the biotrophic interfacial complex is associated with a novel form of secretion involving exocyst components and the Sso1 t-SNARE. By contrast, effectors that are secreted from invasive hyphae into the extracellular compartment follow the conventional secretory pathway.

We have produced a large collection of chemical and irradiation-induced IR64 mutants with different genetic lesions that are amenable to both forward and reverse genetics. About 60,000 IR64 mutants have been generated by mutagenesis using chemicals (diepoxybutane and ethylmethanesulfonate) and irradiation (fast neutron and gamma ray). More than 38,000 independent lines have been advanced to M4 generation enabling evaluation of quantitative traits by replicated trials.

Genetic loci such as Mlc1, Mpg1, Mps1, Slp1, Cal, Ef-Tu, Pfk, and Pgk were highly polymorphic as indicated by the haplotype-diversity, the number of polymorphic sites, and the number of mutations. The genetically homogenous single field population showed high virulence variability or diversity on monogenic rice differentials. The study indicated that the genetic similarity displayed by the isolates collected from a particular geographical location had no consequence on their virulence pattern on rice differentials carrying single/multiple resistance genes.

35957505,Novel insights into host specificity of Pyricularia oryzae and Pyricularia grisea in the infection of gramineous plant roots.,"Pyricularia oryzae and Pyricularia grisea are pathogens that cause blast disease in various monocots. It has been reported that P. oryzae infects the leaves and roots of rice via different mechanisms. However, it is unclear to what extent the tissue types affect the host specificities of P. oryzae and P. grisea. Here, we evaluated the tissue-specific infection strategies of P. oryzae and P. grisea in various gramineous plants. Generally, mycelial plug inoculation caused root browning but the degree of browning did not simply follow the disease index on leaves. Interestingly, the Triticum and Digitaria pathotypes caused strong root growth inhibition in rice, wheat, and barley. Moreover, the Digitaria pathotype inhibited root branching only in rice. Culture filtrate reproduced these inhibitory effects on root, suggesting that some secreted molecules are responsible for the inhibitions. Observation of root sections revealed that most of the infection hyphae penetrated intercellular spaces and further extended into root cells, regardless of pathotype and host plant. The infection hyphae of Digitaria and Triticum pathotypes tended to localize in the outer layer of rice roots, but not in those of wheat and barley roots. The infection hyphae of the Oryza pathotype were distributed in both the intercellular and intracellular spaces of rice root cells. Pathogenesis-related genes and reactive oxygen species accumulation were induced after root inoculation with all combinations. These results suggest that resistance reactions were induced in the roots of gramineous plants against the infection with Pyricularia isolates but failed to prevent fungal invasion.",pyricularia oryzae pyricularia grisea pathogen cause blast disease various monocot reported p oryzae infects leaf root rice via different mechanism however unclear extent tissue type affect host specificity p oryzae p grisea evaluated tissuespecific infection strategy p oryzae p grisea various gramineous plant generally mycelial plug inoculation caused root browning degree browning simply follow disease index leaf interestingly triticum digitaria pathotypes caused strong root growth inhibition rice wheat barley moreover digitaria pathotype inhibited root branching rice culture filtrate reproduced inhibitory effect root suggesting secreted molecule responsible inhibition observation root section revealed infection hypha penetrated intercellular space extended root cell regardless pathotype host plant infection hypha digitaria triticum pathotypes tended localize outer layer rice root wheat barley root infection hypha oryza pathotype distributed intercellular intracellular space rice root cell pathogenesisrelated gene reactive oxygen specie accumulation induced root inoculation combination result suggest resistance reaction induced root gramineous plant infection pyricularia isolates failed prevent fungal invasion,4,"{'Disease': ['blast disease', 'disease index leaf'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
23741492,"Experimental evolution reveals genome-wide spectrum and dynamics of mutations in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.","Knowledge on mutation processes is central to interpreting genetic analysis data as well as understanding the underlying nature of almost all evolutionary phenomena. However, studies on genome-wide mutational spectrum and dynamics in fungal pathogens are scarce, hindering our understanding of their evolution and biology. Here, we explored changes in the phenotypes and genome sequences of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae during the forced in vitro evolution by weekly transfer of cultures on artificial media. Through combination of experimental evolution with high throughput sequencing technology, we found that mutations accumulate rapidly prior to visible phenotypic changes and that both genetic drift and selection seem to contribute to shaping mutational landscape, suggesting the buffering capacity of fungal genome against mutations. Inference of mutational effects on phenotypes through the use of T-DNA insertion mutants suggested that at least some of the DNA sequence mutations are likely associated with the observed phenotypic changes. Furthermore, our data suggest oxidative damages and UV as major sources of mutation during subcultures. Taken together, our work revealed important properties of original source of variation in the genome of the rice blast fungus. We believe that these results provide not only insights into stability of pathogenicity and genome evolution in plant pathogenic fungi but also a model in which evolution of fungal pathogens in natura can be comparatively investigated.",knowledge mutation process central interpreting genetic analysis data well understanding underlying nature almost evolutionary phenomenon however study genomewide mutational spectrum dynamic fungal pathogen scarce hindering understanding evolution biology explored change phenotype genome sequence rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae forced vitro evolution weekly transfer culture artificial medium combination experimental evolution high throughput sequencing technology found mutation accumulate rapidly prior visible phenotypic change genetic drift selection seem contribute shaping mutational landscape suggesting buffering capacity fungal genome mutation inference mutational effect phenotype use tdna insertion mutant suggested least dna sequence mutation likely associated observed phenotypic change furthermore data suggest oxidative damage uv major source mutation subculture taken together work revealed important property original source variation genome rice blast fungus believe result provide insight stability pathogenicity genome evolution plant pathogenic fungi also model evolution fungal pathogen natura comparatively investigated,8,"{'Disease': ['phenotype genome sequence rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'important property original source variation genome rice blast fungus believe result'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['buffering capacity fungal genome mutation inference mutational effect']}",10

In this study, we screened transgenic rice lines expressing the isoflavone synthase (<i>GmIFS1</i>) gene from soybean for rice blast (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) resistance. Two homozygous transgenic lines (I2 and I10), based on single copy gene integration, were identified. The expression of <i>GmIFS1</i> in transgenic lines was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Genistein was detected in the transgenic lines using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Subsequently, the transgenic lines were evaluated against the rice blast pathogen, isolate YJ54 (race IB-54). The results indicated that >60% of the plants in both the lines (I2 and I10) showed resistance against the blast pathogen.

In rice, a large number of <i>R</i> genes have been characterized from various cultivars and have greatly contributed to breeding programs to improve resistance against the rice blast pathogen <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. The extreme diversity of <i>R</i> gene repertoires is thought to be a result of co-evolutionary history between rice and its pathogens including <i>M. oryzae</i>. Here we show that <i>Pii</i> is an allele of Pi5 by DNA sequence characterization and complementation analysis. <i>Pii-1</i> and <i>Pii-2</i> cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from the <i>Pii</i> -carrying cultivar Fujisaka5 . The complementation test in susceptible rice cultivar Dongjin demonstrated that the rice blast resistance mediated by Pii , similar to <i>Pi5</i> , requires the presence of two nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat genes, <i>Pii-1</i> and <i>Pii-2</i> . Consistent with our hypothesis that <i>Pi5</i> and <i>Pii</i> are functionally indistinguishable, the replacement of <i>Pii-1</i> by <i>Pi5-1</i> and <i>Pii-2</i> by <i>Pi5-2</i> , respectively, does not change the level of disease resistance to M. oryzae carrying AVR-Pii. Surprisingly, Exo70F3, required for <i>Pii</i>-mediated resistance, is dispensable for <i>Pi5</i>-mediated resistance.

31689303,Variation in the LRR region of Pi54 protein alters its interaction with the AvrPi54 protein revealed by in silico analysis.,"Rice blast, caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is a destructive disease of rice and responsible for causing extensive damage to the crop. Pi54, a dominant blast resistance gene cloned from rice line Tetep, imparts a broad spectrum resistance against various M. oryzae isolates. Many of its alleles have been explored from wild Oryza species and landraces whose sequences are available in the public domain. Its cognate effector gene AvrPi54 has also been cloned from M. oryzae. Complying with the Flor's gene-for-gene system, Pi54 protein interacts with AvrPi54 protein following fungal invasion leading to the resistance responses in rice cell that prevents the disease development. In the present study Pi54 alleles from 72 rice lines were used to understand the interaction of Pi54 (R) proteins with AvrPi54 (Avr) protein. The physiochemical properties of these proteins varied due to the nucleotide level polymorphism. The ab initio tertiary structures of these R- and Avr- proteins were generated and subjected to the in silico interaction. In this interaction, the residues in the LRR region of R- proteins were shown to interact with the Avr protein. These R proteins were found to have variable strengths of binding due to the differential spatial arrangements of their amino acid residues. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations were performed for the protein pairs that showed stronger interaction than Pi54tetep (original Pi54 from Tetep) protein. We found these proteins were forming h-bond during simulation which indicated an effective binding. The root mean square deviation values and potential energy values were stable during simulation which validated the docking results. From the interaction studies and the molecular dynamics simulations, we concluded that the AvrPi54 protein interacts directly with the resistant Pi54 proteins through the LRR region of Pi54 proteins. Some of the Pi54 proteins from the landraces namely Casebatta, Tadukan, Varun dhan, Govind, Acharmita, HPR-2083, Budda, Jatto, MTU-4870, Dobeja-1, CN-1789, Indira sona, Kulanji pille and Motebangarkaddi cultivars show stronger binding with the AvrPi54 protein, thus these alleles can be effectively used for the rice blast resistance breeding program in future.",rice blast caused ascomycete fungus magnaporthe oryzae destructive disease rice responsible causing extensive damage crop pi dominant blast resistance gene cloned rice line tetep imparts broad spectrum resistance various oryzae isolates many allele explored wild oryza specie landraces whose sequence available public domain cognate effector gene avrpi also cloned oryzae complying flors geneforgene system pi protein interacts avrpi protein following fungal invasion leading resistance response rice cell prevents disease development present study pi allele rice line used understand interaction pi r protein avrpi avr protein physiochemical property protein varied due nucleotide level polymorphism ab initio tertiary structure r avr protein generated subjected silico interaction interaction residue lrr region r protein shown interact avr protein r protein found variable strength binding due differential spatial arrangement amino acid residue additionally molecular dynamic simulation performed protein pair showed stronger interaction pitetep original pi tetep protein found protein forming hbond simulation indicated effective binding root mean square deviation value potential energy value stable simulation validated docking result interaction study molecular dynamic simulation concluded avrpi protein interacts directly resistant pi protein lrr region pi protein pi protein landraces namely casebatta tadukan varun dhan govind acharmita hpr budda jatto mtu dobeja cn indira sona kulanji pille motebangarkaddi cultivar show stronger binding avrpi protein thus allele effectively used rice blast resistance breeding program future,10,"{'Disease': ['ascomycete fungus magnaporthe oryzae destructive disease rice responsible causing extensive damage crop pi dominant blast resistance gene', 'resistance response rice cell prevents disease development present study pi allele rice line'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective binding root mean square deviation value potential energy value stable simulation']}",7

Here, we examine the responses of six different rice cultivars from japonica and indica lineage challenged with P. oryzae. Both susceptible and resistant rice cultivars expressed several metabolites exclusively during P. oryzae infection, including the saponin Bayogenin 3-O-cellobioside.

35997707,"A Basic Guide to the Growth and Manipulation of the Blast Fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.","The blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, is a devastating plant pathogen that threatens global food security. The social and economic importance of blast disease has contributed to this filamentous fungus becoming a model organism for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Availability of the complete genome sequences of many strains of the pathogen, as well as rice and wheat cultivars, coupled with the tractability of M. oryzae to classical and molecular genetic manipulation have contributed to its widespread study. Although M. oryzae has been extensively investigated for the past two decades, procedures for storing, maintaining, and manipulating the blast fungus in the laboratory had not been compiled and updated. As a consequence, there is considerable disparity in how the fungus is stored and manipulated between studies. In this article, we present a collection of protocols providing clear explanations of how to preserve filter stocks of M. oryzae; how to grow the fungus in both liquid and solid media; how to extract genomic DNA from fungal mycelium; how to induce appressorium formation on coverslips for visualization and tissue collection; and how to perform two distinct types of plant infection assay for virulence assessment.

In our previous research, we fine mapped a broad-spectrum resistance gene, Pi-hk1, in chromosome 11. In this research, 2010-9(G1), one of the predominant races of blast in the Taihu Lake region of China, was inoculated into 162 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and two parents, Heikezijing and Suyunuo, for mapping the resistance-blast quantitative trait loci (QTL). Three QTL (Lsqtl4-1, Lsqtl9-1, and Lsqtl11-1) associated with lesion scores were detected on chromosomes 4, 9, and 11 and two QTL (Lnqtl1-1 and Lnqtl9-1) associated with average lesion numbers were detected on chromosomes 1 and 9.

17805575,Characterization of two rice peroxidase promoters that respond to blast fungus-infection.,"Peroxidase (POX) genes consist of a large gene family possibly contributing to self-defense, however constitutive and stress-induced expression patterns of individual gene were poorly understood in rice. We studied here the characteristic expression of two representative rice POX genes, R2329 and R2184, which are blast fungus-inducible (Sasaki et al. in Plant Cell Physiol 45:1442-1452, 2004). Basal GUS activity in R2329 promoter::GUS rice plants was 100-fold higher than that in R2184 promoter::GUS plants, and these levels reflected the transcript levels monitored by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. R2329 promoter was activated by blast fungus-infection and wounding, and R2184 promoter was activated by the fungal-infection and methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-treatment. By histochemical GUS staining analysis, constitutive R2329 and R2184 expression was commonly found in vascular bundle and exodermis in leaves and roots, while the precise expression profile was characteristic. In blast fungus inoculated R2329 promoter::GUS leaves, GUS staining was induced just around fungus-induced local lesions. Analysis of the 5' deleted promoters suggests the presence of many kinds of stress-responsive elements in the regions between -1798 and -748 of R2329 promoter and between -1975 and -548 of R2184 promoter.

34372692,Endophytic <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i> OsiSh-2-Mediated Balancing between Growth and Disease Resistance in Host Rice.,"Plants fine-tune the growth-defense trade-off to survive when facing pathogens. Meanwhile, plant-associated microbes, such as the endophytes inside plant tissues, can benefit plant growth and stress resilience. However, the mechanisms for the beneficial microbes to increase stress resistance with little yield penalty in host plants remain poorly understood. In the present study, we report that endophytic Streptomyces hygroscopicus OsiSh-2 can form a sophisticated interaction with host rice, maintaining cellular homeostasis under pathogen-infection stress, and optimize plant growth and disease resistance in rice. Four-year field trials consistently showed that OsiSh-2 could boost host resistance to rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae while still maintaining a high yield. The integration of the proteomic, physiological, and transcriptional profiling analysis revealed that OsiSh-2 induced rice defense priming and controlled the expression of energy-consuming defense-related proteins, thus increasing the defense capability with the minimized costs of plant immunity. Meanwhile, OsiSh-2 improved the chloroplast development and optimally maintained the expression of proteins related to plant growth under pathogen stress, thus promoting the crop yield. Our results provided a representative example of an endophyte-mediated modulation of disease resistance and fitness in the host plant. The multilayer effects of OsiSh-2 implicate a promising future of using endophytic actinobacteria for disease control and crop yield promotion. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Under disease stress, activation of defense response in plants often comes with the cost of a reduction in growth and yield, which is referred as the growth-defense trade-off. The microorganisms which can be recruited by plants to mitigate the growth-defense trade-off are of great value in crop breeding.

In this study, we characterized the function of an <i>M. oryzae</i> extracellular chitinase, MoChi1, and its interaction with a host protein, OsMBL1, a jacalin-related Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Deletion of <i>MoChi1</i> resulted in reduced aerial hyphal formation and reduced virulence in rice by activating the expression of defense-responsive genes. We confirmed MoChi1 interaction with rice OsMBL1 in vitro and in vivo. <i>OsMBL1</i> was induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and <i>M. oryzae</i> infection.

27329666,Suppressive effects of mycoviral proteins encoded by Magnaporthe oryzae chrysovirus 1 strain A on conidial germination of the rice blast fungus.,"Magnaporthe oryzae chrysovirus 1 strain A (MoCV1-A) is the causal agent of growth repression and attenuated virulence (hypovirulence) of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. We previously revealed that heterologous expression of the MoCV1-A ORF4 protein resulted in cytological damage to the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans. Since the ORF4 protein is one of the components of viral particles, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of the purified virus particle against the conidial germination of M. oryzae, and confirmed its suppressive effects. Recombinant MoCV1-A ORF4 protein produced in Pichia pastoris was also effective for suppression of conidial germination of M. oryzae. MoCV1-A ORF4 protein sequence showed significant similarity to 6 related mycoviral proteins; Botrysphaeria dothidea chrysovirus 1, two Fusarium graminearum viruses, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi mycovirus 1, Penicillium janczewski chrysovirus and Agaricus bisporus virus 1 in the Chrysoviridae family. Multiple alignments of the ORF4-related protein sequences showed that their central regions (210-591 aa in MoCV1-A ORF4) are relatively conserved. Indeed, yeast transformants expressing the conserved central region of MoCV1-A ORF4 protein (325-575 aa) showed similar impaired growth phenotypes as those observed in yeasts expressing the full-length MoCV1-A ORF4 protein. These data suggest that the mycovirus itself and its encoded viral protein can be useful as anti-fungal proteins to control rice blast disease caused by M. oryzae and other pathogenic fungi.",magnaporthe oryzae chrysovirus strain mocva causal agent growth repression attenuated virulence hypovirulence rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae previously revealed heterologous expression mocva orf protein resulted cytological damage yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae cryptococcus neoformans since orf protein one component viral particle evaluated inhibitory effect purified virus particle conidial germination oryzae confirmed suppressive effect recombinant mocva orf protein produced pichia pastoris also effective suppression conidial germination oryzae mocva orf protein sequence showed significant similarity related mycoviral protein botrysphaeria dothidea chrysovirus two fusarium graminearum virus fusarium oxysporum f sp dianthi mycovirus penicillium janczewski chrysovirus agaricus bisporus virus chrysoviridae family multiple alignment orfrelated protein sequence showed central region aa mocva orf relatively conserved indeed yeast transformants expressing conserved central region mocva orf protein aa showed similar impaired growth phenotype observed yeast expressing fulllength mocva orf protein data suggest mycovirus encoded viral protein useful antifungal protein control rice blast disease caused oryzae pathogenic fungi,8,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae chrysovirus', 'virulence hypovirulence rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'purified virus particle conidial germination oryzae', 'significant similarity related mycoviral protein botrysphaeria dothidea chrysovirus two fusarium graminearum virus fusarium oxysporum f sp dianthi mycovirus penicillium janczewski chrysovirus agaricus bisporus virus chrysoviridae family multiple alignment orfrelated protein sequence', 'mycovirus', 'viral protein useful antifungal protein control rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['inhibitory effect', 'suppressive effect']}",7
10071210,"A ""defeated"" rice resistance gene acts as a QTL against a virulent strain of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.","The genetic components responsible for qualitative and quantitative resistance of rice plants to three strains (CR4, CXO8, and CR6) of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) were investigated using a set of 315 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Lemont (japonica) x Teqing (indica) and a complete linkage map with 182 well distributed RFLP markers. We mapped a major gene (Xa4) and ten quantitative trait loci (QTLs) which were largely responsible for segregation of the resistance phenotype in the RILs. The Teqing allele at the Xa4 locus, Xa4T, acted as a dominant resistance gene against CR4 and CXO8. The breakdown of Xa4T-associated resistance mediated by the mutant allele at the avrXa4 locus in the virulent strain CR6 results from significant changes in both gene action (lose of dominance) and the magnitude of gene effect (approximately 50% reduction). Nevertheless, Xa4T still acted as a recessive QTL with a significant residual effect against CR6. The mutant alleles at the avrXa4 locus in CXO8 and CR6 that lead to a reduction in effect, or ""breakdown"", of Xa4T were apparently accompanied by corresponding penalties for their fitness. The quantitative component of resistance to Xoo in the RILs was largely due to a number of resistance QTLs. Most resistance QTLs mapped to genomic locations where major resistance genes and/or QTLs for resistance to Xoo, blast and sheath blight were identified in the same cross. Most QTLs showed consistent levels of resistance against all three Xoo strains.

19271956,The Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence gene AvrPiz-t encodes a predicted secreted protein that triggers the immunity in rice mediated by the blast resistance gene Piz-t.,"The Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence gene AvrPiz-t activates immunity in a gene-for-gene fashion to rice mediated by the blast resistance gene Piz-t. To dissect the molecular mechanism underlying their recognition, we initiated the cloning of AvrPiz-t using a map-based cloning strategy. The AvrPiz-t gene was delimited to an approximately 21-kb genomic fragment, in which six genes were predicted. Complementation tests of each of these six candidate genes led to the final identification of AvrPiz-t, which encodes a 108-amino-acid predicted secreted protein with unknown function and no homologues in M. oryzae or in other sequenced fungi. We found that AvrPiz-t is present in the virulent isolate GUY11 but contains a Pot3 insertion at a position 462 bp upstream from the start codon. Complementation tests of AvrPiz-t genes driven by promoters of varying length revealed that a promoter larger than 462 bp is essential to maintain the AvrPiz-t function. These results suggest that a Pot3 insertion in GUY11 might interfere with the proper function of AvrPiz-t.

The number of polymorphic loci was higher in isolates from Londrina in the Brazilian state of Paraná and Coromandel in Minas Gerais compared with Goiânia in Goiás and São Borja in Rio Grande do Sul. The rice isolate was clearly different from the wheat isolates, and the size difference in polymorphic SSR loci between one isolate from wheat and one isolate from rice was associated with the number of repeats.

18826428,"Contribution of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase, OsSGT1, to chemically induced disease resistance in rice plants.","Systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a natural disease response in plants, can be induced chemically. Salicylic acid (SA) acts as a key endogenous signaling molecule that mediates SAR in dicotyledonous plants. However, the role of SA in monocotyledonous plants has yet to be elucidated. In this study, the mode of action of the agrochemical protectant chemical probenazole was assessed by microarray-based determination of gene expression. Cloning and characterization of the most highly activated probenazole-responsive gene revealed that it encodes UDP-glucose:SA glucosyltransferase (OsSGT1), which catalyzes the conversion of free SA into SA O-beta-glucoside (SAG). We found that SAG accumulated in rice leaf tissue following treatment with probenazole or 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid. A putative OsSGT1 gene from the rice cultivar Akitakomachi was cloned and the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli was characterized, and the results suggested that probenazole-responsive OsSGT1 is involved in the production of SAG. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated silencing of the OsSGT1 gene significantly reduced the probenazole-dependent development of resistance against blast disease, further supporting the suggestion that OsSGT1 is a key mediator of development of chemically induced disease resistance.

32170759,A rapid rice blast detection and identification method based on crop disease spores' diffraction fingerprint texture.,"Rice blast fungus is a worldwide disease, and it is one of the most serious rice diseases in the north and south rice fields in China. The initial symptoms of rice blast are not obvious, and the speed of transmission is fast. Manual identification is time-consuming and laborious. At present, it is a great challenge to realize rapid and accurate early identification of rice blast. In this paper, an identification method based on crop disease spores' diffraction fingerprint texture for rice blast was studied; this method utilizes the light field and texture features of diffraction images. To verify the reliability of the model that we proposed, we selected two methods of manual identification and machine recognition to compare and detect rice blast spores. The experimental results show that the identification of light diffraction characteristics is not only higher than the traditional manual recognition by microscope (increased by more than 0.3%), but also faster after neural network training (increased by more than 90%). The diffraction recognition method used in this study, based on crop disease spores' diffraction fingerprint texture, can be completed in a few seconds, and its test accuracy is 97.18%. The proposed method, a rapid rice blast detection and identification method based on crop disease spores' diffraction fingerprint texture, has certain advantages compared with the existing manual identification by microscope.

39000408,Activation and Autoinhibition Mechanisms of NLR Immune Receptor Pi36 in Rice.,"Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are the most important and largest class of immune receptors in plants. The <i>Pi36</i> gene encodes a canonical CC-NBS-LRR protein that confers resistance to rice blast fungal infections. Here, we show that the CC domain of Pi36 plays a role in cell death induction. Furthermore, self-association is required for the CC domain-mediated cell death, and the self-association ability is correlated with the cell death level. In addition, the NB-ARC domain may suppress the activity of the CC domain through intramolecular interaction. The mutations D440G next to the RNBS-D motif and D503V in the MHD motif autoactivated Pi36, but the mutation K212 in the P-loop motif inhibited this autoactivation, indicating that nucleotide binding of the NB-ARC domain is essential for Pi36 activation. We also found that the LRR domain is required for D503V- and D440G-mediated Pi36 autoactivation. Interestingly, several mutations in the CC domain compromised the CC domain-mediated cell death without affecting the D440G- or D503V-mediated Pi36 autoactivation. The autoactivate Pi36 variants exhibited stronger self-associations than the inactive variants. Taken together, we speculated that the CC domain of Pi36 executes cell death activities, whereas the NB-ARC domain suppressed CC-mediated cell death via intermolecular interaction. The NB-ARC domain releases its suppression of the CC domain and strengthens the self-association of Pi36 to support the CC domain, possibly through nucleotide exchange.",nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat receptor nlrs important largest class immune receptor plant ipii gene encodes canonical ccnbslrr protein confers resistance rice blast fungal infection show cc domain pi play role cell death induction furthermore selfassociation required cc domainmediated cell death selfassociation ability correlated cell death level addition nbarc domain may suppress activity cc domain intramolecular interaction mutation dg next rnbsd motif dv mhd motif autoactivated pi mutation k ploop motif inhibited autoactivation indicating nucleotide binding nbarc domain essential pi activation also found lrr domain required dv dgmediated pi autoactivation interestingly several mutation cc domain compromised cc domainmediated cell death without affecting dg dvmediated pi autoactivation autoactivate pi variant exhibited stronger selfassociations inactive variant taken together speculated cc domain pi executes cell death activity whereas nbarc domain suppressed ccmediated cell death via intermolecular interaction nbarc domain release suppression cc domain strengthens selfassociation pi support cc domain possibly nucleotide exchange,10,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

The process driven by rice blast AvrPik and Pik alleles was investigated through population genetic and evolutionary approaches. The genetic diversity of the non-signal domain of AvrPik was higher than that in its signal peptide domain. Positive selection for particular AvrPik alleles in the northeastern region of China was stronger than in the south. The perfect relationship between the functional lineages and AvrPik allele-specific pathotypes was established by ruling out the nonfunctional lineages derived from additional copies. Only four alleles conditioning stepwise pathotypes were detected in natural populations, which were likely created by only one evolutionary pathway with three recognizable mutation steps. Two non-stepwise pathotypes were determined by two blocks in a network constructed by all 16 possible alleles, indicating that a natural evolution process can be artificially changed by a combination of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Assuming that AvrPik evolution has been largely driven by host selection, the co-evolutionary stepwise relationships between AvrPik and Pik was established.

We showed a high frequency of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of rice line Taipei 309 containing a single gene (Pi54) for blast resistance. Pi54 RNAi leads to a decreased level of Pi54 transcripts, leading to the susceptibility of otherwise M. oryzae-resistant rice lines. However, among the RNAi knockdown plants, the severity of blast disease varied between the lines. Histochemical analysis of the leaves of knockdown plants inoculated with M. oryzae spores also showed typical cell death and blast lesions. Additionally, Pi54 RNAi also showed an effect on the Hda3 gene, a florigen gene playing a role in rice flowering. By using the RNAi technique, for the first time, we showed that the directed degradation of Pi54 transcripts results in a significant reduction in the rice blast resistance response, suggesting that RNAi is a powerful tool for functional validation of genes.",rice blast disease caused magnaporthe oryzae one major disease affecting rice oryza sativa l crop major blast resistance gene pi already cloned deployed different rice variety understand role pi providing rice blast resistance used rna interference rnai approach knock expression gene showed high frequency agrobacterium tumefaciensmediated transformation rice line taipei containing single gene pi blast resistance pi rnai lead decreased level pi transcript leading susceptibility otherwise oryzaeresistant rice line however among rnai knockdown plant severity blast disease varied line histochemical analysis leaf knockdown plant inoculated oryzae spore also showed typical cell death blast lesion additionally pi rnai also showed effect hda gene florigen gene playing role rice flowering using rnai technique first time showed directed degradation pi transcript result significant reduction rice blast resistance response suggesting rnai powerful tool functional validation gene,10,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'rnai knockdown plant severity blast disease varied line histochemical analysis leaf knockdown plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect']}",13
24141028,Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 increases Arabidopsis resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and rice resistance against Magnaporthe grisea.,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are crucial calcium sensors involved in plant responses to pathogen infection. Here, we report isolation and functional characterization of the pathogen-responsive rice OsCPK10 gene. The expression of OsCPK10 was strongly induced following treatment with a Magnaporthe grisea elicitor. Kinase activity assay showed that the functional OsCPK10 protein not only autophosphorylated, but also phosphorylated Casein in a calcium-dependent manner. Overexpression of constitutively active OsCPK10 in Arabidopsis enhanced the resistance to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, associated with elevated expression of both SA- and JA-related defense genes.

32209696,Magnaporthe oryzae Auxiliary Activity Protein MoAa91 Functions as Chitin-Binding Protein To Induce Appressorium Formation on Artificial Inductive Surfaces and Suppress Plant Immunity.,"The appressoria that are generated by the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> in response to surface cues are important for successful colonization. Previous work showed that regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) and RGS-like proteins play critical roles in appressorium formation. However, the mechanisms by which these proteins orchestrate surface recognition for appressorium induction remain unclear. Here, we performed comparative transcriptomic studies of Δ<i>Morgs</i> mutant and wild-type strains and found that <i>M. oryzae</i> Aa91 (MoAa91), a homolog of the auxiliary activity family 9 protein (Aa9), was required for surface recognition of <i>M. oryzae</i> We found that <i>MoAA91</i> was regulated by the MoMsn2 transcription factor and that its disruption resulted in defects in both appressorium formation on the artificial inductive surface and full virulence of the pathogen. We further showed that MoAa91 was secreted into the apoplast space and was capable of competing with the immune receptor chitin elicitor-binding protein precursor (CEBiP) for chitin binding, thereby suppressing chitin-induced plant immune responses. In summary, we have found that MoAa91 is a novel signaling molecule regulated by RGS and RGS-like proteins and that MoAa91 not only governs appressorium development and virulence but also functions as an effector to suppress host immunity.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> generates infection structure appressoria in response to surface cues largely due to functions of signaling molecules, including G-proteins, regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways, cAMP signaling, and TOR signaling pathways. <i>M. oryzae</i> encodes eight RGS and RGS-like proteins (MoRgs1 to MoRgs8), and MoRgs1, MoRgs3, MoRgs4, and MoRgs7 were found to be particularly important in appressorium development. To explore the mechanisms by which these proteins regulate appressorium development, we have performed a comparative <i>in planta</i> transcriptomic study and identified an <u>a</u>uxiliary <u>a</u>ctivity family 9 protein (Aa9) homolog that we named MoAa91. We showed that MoAa91 was secreted from appressoria and that the recombinant MoAa91 could compete with a chitin elicitor-binding protein precursor (CEBiP) for chitin binding, thereby suppressing chitin-induced plant immunity. By identifying MoAa91 as a novel signaling molecule functioning in appressorium development and an effector in suppressing host immunity, our studies revealed a novel mechanism by which RGS and RGS-like proteins regulate pathogen-host interactions.",appressoria generated rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei response surface cue important successful colonization previous work showed regulator gprotein signaling rg rgslike protein play critical role appressorium formation however mechanism protein orchestrate surface recognition appressorium induction remain unclear performed comparative transcriptomic study δimorgsi mutant wildtype strain found im oryzaei aa moaa homolog auxiliary activity family protein aa required surface recognition im oryzaei found imoaai regulated momsn transcription factor disruption resulted defect appressorium formation artificial inductive surface full virulence pathogen showed moaa secreted apoplast space capable competing immune receptor chitin elicitorbinding protein precursor cebip chitin binding thereby suppressing chitininduced plant immune response summary found moaa novel signaling molecule regulated rg rgslike protein moaa governs appressorium development virulence also function effector suppress host immunitybimportanceb rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei generates infection structure appressoria response surface cue largely due function signaling molecule including gproteins regulator gprotein signaling rg mitogenactivated protein map kinase pathway camp signaling tor signaling pathway im oryzaei encodes eight rg rgslike protein morgs morgs morgs morgs morgs morgs found particularly important appressorium development explore mechanism protein regulate appressorium development performed comparative iin plantai transcriptomic study identified uauuxiliary uauctivity family protein aa homolog named moaa showed moaa secreted appressoria recombinant moaa could compete chitin elicitorbinding protein precursor cebip chitin binding thereby suppressing chitininduced plant immunity identifying moaa novel signaling molecule functioning appressorium development effector suppressing host immunity study revealed novel mechanism rg rgslike protein regulate pathogenhost interaction,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['moaa novel signaling molecule functioning appressorium development effector']}",9
25111047,The blast resistance gene Pi54of cloned from Oryza officinalis interacts with Avr-Pi54 through its novel non-LRR domains.,"The dominant rice blast resistance gene Pi54 cloned by map-based cloning approach from indica rice cultivar Tetep confers broad spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae. In this investigation, an orthologue of Pi54 designated as Pi54of was cloned from Oryza officinalis conferring high degree of resistance to M. oryzae and is functionally validated. We have also characterized the Pi54of protein and demonstrate its interaction with AVR-Pi54 protein. The Pi54of encoded ∼43 kDa small and unique cytoplasmic LRR family of disease resistance protein having unique Zinc finger domain overlapped with the leucine rich repeat regions. Pi54of showed Magnaporthe-induced expression. The phylogenetic and western blot analysis confirmed orthologous nature of Pi54 and Pi54of genes, whereas the identity of protein was confirmed through MALDI-TOF analysis. The in silico analysis showed that Pi54of is structurally more stable than other cloned Pi54 proteins. The molecular docking revealed that Pi54of protein interacts with AVR-Pi54 through novel non-LRR domains such as STI1 and RhoGEF. The STI1 and GEF domains which interact with AVR-Pi54 are also components of rice defensome complex. The Pi54of protein showed differential domain specificity while interacting with the AVR protein. Functional complementation revealed that Pi54of transferred in two rice lines belonging to indica and japonica background imparts enhanced resistance against three highly virulent strains of M. oryzae. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that a rice blast resistance gene Pi54of cloned from wild species of rice provides high degree of resistance to M. oryzae and might display different molecular mechanism involved in AVRPi54-Pi54of interaction.",dominant rice blast resistance gene pi cloned mapbased cloning approach indica rice cultivar tetep confers broad spectrum resistance magnaporthe oryzae investigation orthologue pi designated piof cloned oryza officinalis conferring high degree resistance oryzae functionally validated also characterized piof protein demonstrate interaction avrpi protein piof encoded ∼ kda small unique cytoplasmic lrr family disease resistance protein unique zinc finger domain overlapped leucine rich repeat region piof showed magnaportheinduced expression phylogenetic western blot analysis confirmed orthologous nature pi piof gene whereas identity protein confirmed malditof analysis silico analysis showed piof structurally stable cloned pi protein molecular docking revealed piof protein interacts avrpi novel nonlrr domain sti rhogef sti gef domain interact avrpi also component rice defensome complex piof protein showed differential domain specificity interacting avr protein functional complementation revealed piof transferred two rice line belonging indica japonica background imparts enhanced resistance three highly virulent strain oryzae study first time demonstrated rice blast resistance gene piof cloned wild specie rice provides high degree resistance oryzae might display different molecular mechanism involved avrpipiof interaction,10,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
36803211,MoVast2 combined with MoVast1 regulates lipid homeostasis and autophagy in <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.,"Macroautophagy/autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved biological process among eukaryotes that degrades unwanted materials such as protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria and even viruses to maintain cell survival. Our previous studies have demonstrated that MoVast1 acts as an autophagy regulator regulating autophagy, membrane tension, and sterol homeostasis in rice blast fungus. However, the detailed regulatory relationships between autophagy and VASt domain proteins remain unsolved. Here, we identified another VASt domain-containing protein, MoVast2, and further uncovered the regulatory mechanism of MoVast2 in <i>M. oryzae</i>. MoVast2 interacted with MoVast1 and MoAtg8, and colocalized at the PAS and deletion of <i>MoVAST2</i> results in inappropriate autophagy progress. Through TOR activity analysis, sterols and sphingolipid content detection, we found high sterol accumulation in the Δ<i>Movast2</i> mutant, whereas this mutant showed low sphingolipids and low activity of both TORC1 and TORC2. In addition, MoVast2 colocalized with MoVast1. The localization of MoVast2 in the <i>MoVAST1</i> deletion mutant was normal; however, deletion of <i>MoVAST2</i> leads to mislocalization of MoVast1. Notably, the wide-target lipidomic analyses revealed significant changes in sterols and sphingolipids, the major PM components, in the Δ<i>Movast2</i> mutant, which was involved in lipid metabolism and autophagic pathways.

15322754,"Tagging and mapping of a rice gall midge resistance gene, Gm8, and development of SCARs for use in marker-aided selection and gene pyramiding.","Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), we have tagged and mapped Gm8, a gene conferring resistance to the rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae), a major insect pest of rice, onto rice chromosome 8. Using AFLPs, two fragments, AR257 and AS168, were identified that were linked to the resistant and susceptible phenotypes, respectively. Another resistant phenotype-specific marker, AP19(587), was also identified using RAPDs. SCAR primers based on the sequence of the fragments AR257 and AS168 failed to reveal polymorphism between the resistant and the susceptible parents. However, PCR using primers based on the regions flanking AR257 revealed polymorphism that was phenotype-specific. In contrast, PCR carried out using primers flanking the susceptible phenotype-associated fragment AS168 produced a monomorphic fragment. Restriction digestion of these monomorphic fragments revealed polymorphism between the susceptible and resistant parents. Nucleotide BLAST searches revealed that the three fragments show strong homology to rice PAC and BAC clones that formed a contig representing the short arm of chromosome 8. PCR amplification using the above-mentioned primers on a larger population, derived from a cross between two indica rice varieties, Jhitpiti (resistant parent) and TN1 (susceptible parent), showed that there is a tight linkage between the markers and the Gm8 locus. These markers, therefore, have potential for use in marker-aided selection and pyramiding of Gm8 along with other previously tagged gall midge resistance genes [ Gm2, Gm4(t), and Gm7].",using amplified fragment length polymorphism aflps random amplified polymorphic dna rapds tagged mapped gm gene conferring resistance rice gall midge orseolia oryzae major insect pest rice onto rice chromosome using aflps two fragment ar identified linked resistant susceptible phenotype respectively another resistant phenotypespecific marker ap also identified using rapds scar primer based sequence fragment ar failed reveal polymorphism resistant susceptible parent however pcr using primer based region flanking ar revealed polymorphism phenotypespecific contrast pcr carried using primer flanking susceptible phenotypeassociated fragment produced monomorphic fragment restriction digestion monomorphic fragment revealed polymorphism susceptible resistant parent nucleotide blast search revealed three fragment show strong homology rice pac bac clone formed contig representing short arm chromosome pcr amplification using abovementioned primer larger population derived cross two indica rice variety jhitpiti resistant parent tn susceptible parent showed tight linkage marker gm locus marker therefore potential use markeraided selection pyramiding gm along previously tagged gall midge resistance gene gm gmt gm,2,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
29966327,Application of the Fluorescent Dye BODIPY in the Study of Lipid Dynamics of the Rice Blast Fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.,"Rice blast is one of the most serious diseases affecting rice yield which is caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, a model organism for studies on plant pathogenic fungi. Lipids stored in <i>M. oryzae</i> cells have been shown to be crucial for the development of appressorium turgor and the ability of the pathogen to cause infection. Nile red staining is a common method to study lipid dynamics in phytopathogenic fungi. However, the disadvantages of this dye include its wide spectrum, poor water solubility, and susceptibility to quenching. Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) is a new type of fluorescent dye that has a different emission wavelength to that of Nile red as well as many desirable spectral and chemical properties. In this study, we used BODIPY to stain the lipids in <i>M. oryzae</i> cells to seek a possible substitute to Nile red in the study of lipid dynamics in plant pathogenic fungi. Our data showed that through simple and routine procedures, BODIPY was able to distinctly label lipids in the cells of mycelia and conidia. The positions of lipids labeled by BODIPY were essentially identical to those labeled by Nile red, but with more clear fluorescence labelling, lower background, and higher specificity. The use of BODIPY to stain germinating <i>M. oryzae</i> conidia allowed the lipid dynamics to be clearly tracked during this process. We also achieved double and multiple fluorescent staining conidia by combining BODIPY with the red fluorescent protein mCherry and other fluorescent dyes, such as Calcofluor white and DAPI, in conidia, mycelia, and sexual structures of <i>M. oryzae</i>.

34142847,Spatiotemporal Survey of Multiple Rice Diseases in Irrigated Areas Compared to Rainfed Lowlands in the Western Burkina Faso.,"Multiple constraints affect rice yields in West Africa. Among these constraints are viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens.

For this purpose, we selected a set of three pairs of sites, each comprising an irrigated area and a neighboring rainfed lowland, and studied them over four consecutive years. We first performed interviews with the rice farmers to better characterize the management practices at the different sites. This study revealed that the transplanting of rice and the possibility of growing rice twice a year are restricted to irrigated areas, while other practices, such as the use of registered rice cultivars, fertilization, and pesticides, are not specific but differ between the two rice growing systems. Then, we performed symptom observations at these study sites to monitor the following four diseases: yellow mottle disease, Bacterial Leaf Streak (BLS), rice leaf blast, and brown spot. The infection rates were found to be higher in irrigated areas than in rainfed lowlands, both when analyzing all observed symptoms together (any of the four diseases) and when specifically considering each of the two diseases: BLS and rice leaf blast. Brown spot was particularly prevalent in all six study sites, while yellow mottle disease was particularly structured geographically.

It was cloned into a monocot expression vector and introduced into rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) calluses by microprojectile bombardment. Three to five weeks after the bombardment, multicellular clusters emitting bright-green EGFP fluorescence were obtained with 10 microg/ml BS, which is not sufficient to completely inhibit the growth of non-transformed tissues. Fluorescent sectors (approximately 2mm in diameter) excised from the calluses regenerated into transgenic plantlets (approximately 10 cm in height) as early as 51 (average 77+/-11) days after the bombardment. The visual antibiotic selection was more efficient and required less time than the bialaphos selection with bar. In addition, the small size (1.1 kb) of gfbsd is preferable for construction of transformation vectors.

Fifty-two M. oryzae isolates were collected from different rice ecosystems of southern India. A majority of them (n = 28) formed a circular colony on culture media. Based on the disease reaction on susceptible cultivar (cv. HR-12), all 52 isolates were classified in to highly virulent (n = 28), moderately virulent (n = 11) and less-virulent (13) types. Among the 52 isolates, 38 were selected for deducing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence diversity. For deducing phylogeny, another set of 36 isolates from other parts of the world was included, which yielded two distinct phylogenetic clusters. We identified eight haplotype groups and 91 variable sites within the ITS sequences, and haplotype-group-2 (Hap_2) was predominant (n = 24). The Tajima's and Fu's Fs neutrality tests exhibited many rare alleles. Furthermore, PCR analysis for detecting the presence of five Avr genes in the different M. oryzae isolates using Avr gene-specific primers in PCR revealed that Avr-Piz-t, Avr-Pik, Avr-Pia and Avr-Pita were present in 73.68%, 73.68%, 63.16% and 47.37% of the isolates studied, respectively; whereas, Avr-Pii was identified only in 13.16% of the isolates.

Isobavachalcone (IBC), an active ingredient of <i>Psoralea corylifolia</i> L. extract, is an effective fungicide against rice blast. To determine the mechanism of IBC against <i>M. oryzae</i>, the effect of IBC on the metabolic pathway of <i>M. oryzae</i> was explored by transcriptome profiling. In <i>M. oryzae</i>, the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 (PDHE1), part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA cycle), was significantly decreased in response to treatment with IBC, which was verified by qPCR and testing of enzyme activity. To further elucidate the interactions between IBC and PDHE1, the 3D structure model of the PDHE1 from <i>M. oryzae</i> was established based on homology modeling. The model was utilized to analyze the molecular interactions through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, revealing that IBC has π-π stacking interactions with residue TYR139 and undergoes hydrogen bonding with residue ASP217 of PDHE1. Additionally, the nonpolar residues PHE111, MET174, ILE 187, VAL188, and MET250 form strong hydrophobic interactions with IBC.

31615964,System-Wide Characterization of MoArf GTPase Family Proteins and Adaptor Protein MoGga1 Involved in the Development and Pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.,"ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) small GTPase family members are involved in vesicle trafficking and organelle maintenance in organisms ranging from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> to humans. A previous study identified <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Arf6 (MoArf6) as one of the Arf proteins that regulates growth and conidiation in the rice blast fungus <i>M. oryzae</i>, but the remaining family proteins remain unknown. Here, we identified six additional Arf proteins, including MoArf1, MoArl1, MoArl3, MoArl8, MoCin4, and MoSar1, as well as their sole adaptor protein, MoGga1, and determined their shared and specific functions. We showed that the majority of these proteins exhibit positive regulatory functions, most notably, in growth. Importantly, MoArl1, MoCin4, and MoGga1 are involved in pathogenicity through the regulation of host penetration and invasive hyphal growth. MoArl1 and MoCin4 also regulate normal vesicle trafficking, and MoCin4 further controls the formation of the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC). Moreover, we showed that Golgi-cytoplasm cycling of MoArl1 is required for its function. Finally, we demonstrated that interactions between MoArf1 and MoArl1 with MoGga1 are important for Golgi localization and pathogenicity. Collectively, our findings revealed the shared and specific functions of Arf family members in <i>M. oryzae</i> and shed light on how these proteins function through conserved mechanisms to govern growth, transport, and virulence of the blast fungus.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is the causal agent of rice blast, representing the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, which results in losses of amounts of rice that could feed more than 60 million people each year. Arf (ADP ribosylation factor) small GTPase family proteins are involved in vesicle trafficking and organelle maintenance in eukaryotic cells.

25358295,Enhancement of innate immune system in monocot rice by transferring the dicotyledonous elongation factor Tu receptor EFR.,"The elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) receptor (EFR) in cruciferous plants specifically recognizes the N-terminal acetylated elf18 region of bacterial EF-Tu and thereby activates plant immunity. It has been demonstrated that Arabidopsis EFR confers broad-spectrum bacterial resistance in the EFR transgenic solanaceous plants. Here, the transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Zhonghua 17) and cell cultures with constitutive expression of AtEFR were developed to investigate whether AtEFR senses EF-Tu and thus enhances bacterial resistance in the monocot plants. We demonstrated that the Xanthomonas oryzae-derived elf18 peptide induced oxidative burst and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in the AtEFR transgenic rice cells and plants, respectively. Pathogenesis-related genes, such as OsPBZ1, were upregulated dramatically in transgenic rice plant and cell lines in response to elf18 stimulation. Importantly, pretreatment with elf18 triggered strong resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae in the transgenic plants, which was largely dependent on the AtEFR expression level. These plants also exhibited enhanced resistance to rice bacterial brown stripe, but not to rice fungal blast. Collectively, the results indicate that the rice plants with heterologous expression of AtEFR recognize bacterial EF-Tu and exhibit enhanced broad-spectrum bacterial disease resistance and that pattern recognition receptor-mediated immunity may be manipulated across the two plant classes, dicots and monocots.",elongation factor tu eftu receptor efr cruciferous plant specifically recognizes nterminal acetylated elf region bacterial eftu thereby activates plant immunity demonstrated arabidopsis efr confers broadspectrum bacterial resistance efr transgenic solanaceous plant transgenic rice plant oryza sativa l ssp japonica cv zhonghua cell culture constitutive expression atefr developed investigate whether atefr sens eftu thus enhances bacterial resistance monocot plant demonstrated xanthomonas oryzaederived elf peptide induced oxidative burst mitogenactivated protein kinase activation atefr transgenic rice cell plant respectively pathogenesisrelated gene ospbz upregulated dramatically transgenic rice plant cell line response elf stimulation importantly pretreatment elf triggered strong resistance x oryzae pv oryzae transgenic plant largely dependent atefr expression level plant also exhibited enhanced resistance rice bacterial brown stripe rice fungal blast collectively result indicate rice plant heterologous expression atefr recognize bacterial eftu exhibit enhanced broadspectrum bacterial disease resistance pattern recognition receptormediated immunity may manipulated across two plant class dicot monocot,8,"{'Disease': ['bacterial eftu exhibit enhanced broadspectrum bacterial disease resistance pattern recognition'], 'Treatment': ['pretreatment'], 'Symptom': []}",7
16531052,Functional characterization of OsRacB GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice.,"The rice genome contains at least seven expressed Rop small GTPase genes. Of these Rops, OsRac1 is the only characterized gene that has been implicated in disease resistance as a positive regulator. To our interest in finding a negative ROP regulator of disease resistance in rice, we applied a ""phylogeny of function"" approach to rice Rops, and identified OsRacB based on its close genetic orthologous relationship with the barley HvRacB gene, a known negative regulator of disease resistance. To determine the function of OsRacB, we isolated the OsRacB cDNA and conducted gene expression and transgenic studies. OsRacB, a single copy gene in the genome of rice, shared 98% identity with HvRacB at the amino acid level. Its mRNA was strongly expressed in leaf sheath (LS) and in panicles, but was very weakly expressed in young and mature leaves. The basal mRNA level of OsRacB in LS of two-week-old seedlings was strongly down-regulated upon wounding by cut and treatment with jasmonic acid. A dramatic down-regulation in the OsRacB transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea. Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsRacB showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy of green fluorescent protein (GFP):OsRacB-transformed onion cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts revealed OsRacB association with plasma membrane (PM), suggesting that PM localization is required for proper function of OsRacB. Based on these results, we suggest that OsRacB functions as a potential regulator for a basal disease resistance pathway in rice.",rice genome contains least seven expressed rop small gtpase gene rops osrac characterized gene implicated disease resistance positive regulator interest finding negative rop regulator disease resistance rice applied phylogeny function approach rice rops identified osracb based close genetic orthologous relationship barley hvracb gene known negative regulator disease resistance determine function osracb isolated osracb cdna conducted gene expression transgenic study osracb single copy gene genome rice shared identity hvracb amino acid level mrna strongly expressed leaf sheath l panicle weakly expressed young mature leaf basal mrna level osracb l twoweekold seedling strongly downregulated upon wounding cut treatment jasmonic acid dramatic downregulation osracb transcript also found plant inoculated blast pathogen magnaporthe grisea interestingly transgenic rice plant overexpressing osracb showed increased symptom development response rice blast pathogen additionally fluorescence microscopy green fluorescent protein gfposracbtransformed onion cell arabidopsis protoplast revealed osracb association plasma membrane pm suggesting pm localization required proper function osracb based result suggest osracb function potential regulator basal disease resistance pathway rice,7,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance positive regulator interest', 'negative rop regulator disease resistance rice applied phylogeny function approach rice rops', 'osracb function potential regulator basal disease resistance pathway rice'], 'Treatment': ['cut treatment jasmonic acid'], 'Symptom': ['increased symptom development response rice blast pathogen']}",7
31742855,Genome-wide association study identifies an NLR gene that confers partial resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.,"Because of the frequent breakdown of major resistance (R) genes, identification of new partial R genes against rice blast disease is an important goal of rice breeding. In this study, we used a core collection of the Rice Diversity Panel II (C-RDP-II), which contains 584 rice accessions and are genotyped with 700 000 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The C-RDP-II accessions were inoculated with three blast strains collected from different rice-growing regions in China. Genome-wide association study identified 27 loci associated with rice blast resistance (LABRs). Among them, 22 LABRs were not associated with any known blast R genes or QTLs. Interestingly, a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene cluster exists in the LABR12 region on chromosome 4. One of the NLR genes is highly conserved in multiple partially resistant rice cultivars, and its expression is significantly up-regulated at the early stages of rice blast infection. Knockout of this gene via CRISPR-Cas9 in transgenic plants partially reduced blast resistance to four blast strains. The identification of this new non-strain specific partial R gene, tentatively named rice blast Partial Resistance gene 1 (PiPR1), provides genetic material that will be useful for understanding the partial resistance mechanism and for breeding durably resistant cultivars against blast disease of rice.",frequent breakdown major resistance r gene identification new partial r gene rice blast disease important goal rice breeding study used core collection rice diversity panel ii crdpii contains rice accession genotyped singlenucleotide polymorphism snp marker crdpii accession inoculated three blast strain collected different ricegrowing region china genomewide association study identified locus associated rice blast resistance labrs among labrs associated known blast r gene qtls interestingly nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat nlr gene cluster exists labr region chromosome one nlr gene highly conserved multiple partially resistant rice cultivar expression significantly upregulated early stage rice blast infection knockout gene via crisprcas transgenic plant partially reduced blast resistance four blast strain identification new nonstrain specific partial r gene tentatively named rice blast partial resistance gene pipr provides genetic material useful understanding partial resistance mechanism breeding durably resistant cultivar blast disease rice,2,"{'Disease': ['new partial r gene rice blast disease important goal rice breeding study', 'durably resistant cultivar blast disease rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
39191251,tRNA-m<sup>1</sup>A methylation controls the infection of Magnaporthe oryzae by supporting ergosterol biosynthesis.,"Ergosterols are essential components of fungal plasma membranes. Inhibitors targeting ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG) genes are critical for controlling fungal pathogens, including Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast. However, the translational mechanisms governing ERG gene expression remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that the Trm6/Trm61 complex catalyzes dynamic N<sup>1</sup>-methyladenosine at position 58 (m<sup>1</sup>A58) in 51 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) of M. oryzae, significantly influencing translation at both the initiation and elongation stages. Notably, tRNA m<sup>1</sup>A58 promotes elongation speed at most cognate codons mainly by enhancing eEF1-tRNA binding rather than affecting tRNA abundance or charging. The absence of m<sup>1</sup>A58 leads to substantial decreases in the translation of ERG genes, ergosterol production, and, consequently, fungal virulence. Simultaneously targeting the Trm6/Trm61 complex and the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway markedly improves rice blast control. Our findings demonstrate an important role of m<sup>1</sup>A58-mediated translational regulation in ergosterol production and fungal infection, offering a potential strategy for fungicide development.",ergosterol essential component fungal plasma membrane inhibitor targeting ergosterol biosynthesis erg gene critical controlling fungal pathogen including magnaporthe oryzae fungus cause rice blast however translational mechanism governing erg gene expression remain largely unexplored show trmtrm complex catalyzes dynamic nsupsupmethyladenosine position msupsupa transfer rna trna oryzae significantly influencing translation initiation elongation stage notably trna msupsupa promotes elongation speed cognate codon mainly enhancing eeftrna binding rather affecting trna abundance charging absence msupsupa lead substantial decrease translation erg gene ergosterol production consequently fungal virulence simultaneously targeting trmtrm complex ergosterol biosynthesis pathway markedly improves rice blast control finding demonstrate important role msupsupamediated translational regulation ergosterol production fungal infection offering potential strategy fungicide development,8,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae fungus cause rice blast however translational mechanism'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

The results obtained with cultured cells showed that in this material CHN treatment could trigger a set of defence responses, including the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), increases in the activities of phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5) and chitinase (CHI; EC 3.2.1.14), increases in transcription of defence-related genes beta-1,3-glucanase (glu) and chitinase (chi) and accumulation of pathogen-related protein (PR1). Furthermore, CHNs of different MWs were observed to have different capacities to induce defence responses. CHNs of low MWs were more effective at inducing the described defence responses than those of higher MWs. Enhanced defence against rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea 97-23-2D1 was observed in rice seedlings treated with low MW CHNs compared to seedlings treated with higher MW CHNs. In all cases, suppressing the production of H2O2 by adding scavengers dimethylthiourea (DMTU), 2,5-dihydroxycinnamic acid methyl ester (DHC), catalase (Cat) or ascorbate (As) blocked the defence responses.

16387888,The broad-spectrum blast resistance gene Pi9 encodes a nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein and is a member of a multigene family in rice.,The broad-spectrum rice blast resistance gene Pi9 was cloned using a map-based cloning strategy. Sequencing of a 76-kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contig spanning the Pi9 locus led to identification of six tandemly arranged resistance-like genes with a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (Nbs1-Pi9-Nbs6-Pi9). Analysis of selected Pi9 deletion mutants and transformation of a 45-kb fragment from the BAC contig into the susceptible rice cultivar TP309 narrowed down Pi9 to the candidate genes Nbs2-Pi9 and Nbs3-Pi9. Disease evaluation of the transgenic lines carrying the individual candidate genes confirmed that Nbs2-Pi9 is the Pi9 gene. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the six paralogs at the Pi9 locus belong to four classes and gene duplication might be one of the major evolutionary forces contributing to the formation of the NBS-LRR gene cluster. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that Pi9 was constitutively expressed in the Pi9-resistant plants and was not induced by blast infection.

27258255,The Transcription Factor OsWRKY45 Negatively Modulates the Resistance of Rice to the Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.,"WRKY transcription factors play a central role not only in plant growth and development but also in plant stress responses. However, the role of WRKY transcription factors in herbivore-induced plant defenses and their underlying mechanisms, especially in rice, remains largely unclear. Here, we cloned a rice WRKY gene OsWRKY45, whose expression was induced by mechanical wounding, by infestation of the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) and by treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA). The antisense expression of OsWRKY45 (as-wrky) enhanced BPH-induced levels of H₂O₂ and ethylene, reduced feeding and oviposition preference as well as the survival rate of BPH, and delayed the development of BPH nymphs. Consistently, lower population densities of BPH on as-wrky lines, compared to those on wild-type (WT) plants, were observed in field experiments. On the other hand, as-wrky lines in the field had lower susceptibility to sheath blight (caused by Rhizoctonia solani) but higher susceptibility to rice blast (caused by Magnaporthe oryzae) than did WT plants. These findings suggest that OsWRKY45 plays important but contrasting roles in regulating the resistance of rice to pathogens and herbivores, and attention should be paid if OsWRKY45 is used to develop disease or herbivore-resistant rice.",wrky transcription factor play central role plant growth development also plant stress response however role wrky transcription factor herbivoreinduced plant defense underlying mechanism especially rice remains largely unclear cloned rice wrky gene oswrky whose expression induced mechanical wounding infestation brown planthopper bph nilaparvata lugens treatment jasmonic acid ja salicylic acid sa antisense expression oswrky aswrky enhanced bphinduced level h₂o₂ ethylene reduced feeding oviposition preference well survival rate bph delayed development bph nymph consistently lower population density bph aswrky line compared wildtype wt plant observed field experiment hand aswrky line field lower susceptibility sheath blight caused rhizoctonia solani higher susceptibility rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae wt plant finding suggest oswrky play important contrasting role regulating resistance rice pathogen herbivore attention paid oswrky used develop disease herbivoreresistant rice,12,"{'Disease': ['oswrky used develop disease herbivoreresistant rice'], 'Treatment': ['mechanical wounding infestation brown planthopper bph nilaparvata lugens treatment jasmonic acid ja salicylic acid sa antisense expression'], 'Symptom': []}",7
34702740,A designer rice NLR immune receptor confers resistance to the rice blast fungus carrying noncorresponding avirulence effectors.,"Plant nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors recognize avirulence effectors directly through their integrated domains (IDs) or indirectly via the effector-targeted proteins. Previous studies have succeeded in generating designer NLR receptors with new recognition profiles by engineering IDs or targeted proteins based on prior knowledge of their interactions with the effectors. However, it is yet a challenge to design a new plant receptor capable of recognizing effectors that function by unknown mechanisms. Several rice NLR immune receptors, including RGA5, possess an integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain that recognizes corresponding <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Avrs and ToxB-like (MAX) effectors in the rice blast fungus. Here, we report a designer rice NLR receptor RGA5<sup>HMA2</sup> carrying an engineered, integrated HMA domain (RGA5-HMA2) that can recognize the noncorresponding MAX effector AvrPib and confers the RGA4-dependent resistance to the <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates expressing AvrPib, which originally triggers the Pib-mediated blast resistance via unknown mechanisms. The RGA5-HMA2 domain is contrived based on the high structural similarity of AvrPib with two MAX effectors, AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, recognized by cognate RGA5-HMA, the binding interface between AVR1-CO39 and RGA5-HMA, and the distinct surface charge of AvrPib and RAG5-HMA. This work demonstrates that rice NLR receptors with the HMA domain can be engineered to confer resistance to the <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates noncorresponding but structurally similar MAX effectors, which manifest cognate NLR receptor-mediated resistance with unknown mechanisms.

Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation.

In this study, we took a quantitative proteomic approach and identified 634 rice proteins responsive to infections by both <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> strains Guy11 and JS153. These two strains have distinct pathogenesis mechanisms. Therefore, the common responding proteins represent conserved basal defense to a broad spectrum of blast pathogens. Gene ontology analysis indicates that the &ldquo;responding to stimulus” biological process is explicitly enriched, among which the proteins responding to oxidative stress and biotic stress are the most prominent. These analyses led to the discoveries of OsPRX59 and OsPRX62 that are robust callose inducers, and OsHSP81 that is capable of inducing both ROS production and callose deposition.

28628655,MoEnd3 regulates appressorium formation and virulence through mediating endocytosis in rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Eukaryotic cells respond to environmental stimuli when cell surface receptors are bound by environmental ligands. The binding initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in the appropriate intracellular responses. Studies have shown that endocytosis is critical for receptor internalization and signaling activation. In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, a non-canonical G-protein coupled receptor, Pth11, and membrane sensors MoMsb2 and MoSho1 are thought to function upstream of G-protein/cAMP signaling and the Pmk1 MAPK pathway to regulate appressorium formation and pathogenesis. However, little is known about how these receptors or sensors are internalized and transported into intracellular compartments. We found that the MoEnd3 protein is important for endocytic transport and that the ΔMoend3 mutant exhibited defects in efficient internalization of Pth11 and MoSho1.

Intriguingly, restoring Pmk1 phosphorylation levels in ΔMoend3 suppressed most of these defects. Moreover, we demonstrated that MoEnd3 is subject to regulation by MoArk1 through protein phosphorylation. We also found that MoEnd3 has additional functions in facilitating the secretion of effectors, including Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t that suppress rice immunity.

24197785,Co-expression of RCH10 and AGLU1 confers rice resistance to fungal sheath blight Rhizoctonia solani and blast Magnorpathe oryzae and reveals impact on seed germination.,"Rice sheath blight and blast caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kühn and Magnorpathe oryzae respectively, are the two most destructive fungal diseases in rice. With no genetic natural traits conferring resistance to sheath blight, transgenic manipulation provides an obvious approach. In this study, the rice basic chitinase gene (RCH10) and the alfalfa β-1,3-glucanase gene (AGLU1) were tandemly inserted into transformation vector pBI101 under the control of 35S promoter with its enhancer sequence to generate a double-defense gene expression cassette pZ100. The pZ100 cassette was transformed into rice (cv. Taipei 309) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. More than 160 independent transformants were obtained and confirmed by PCR. Northern analysis of inheritable progenies revealed similar levels of both RCH10 and AGLU1 transcripts in the same individuals. Disease resistance to both sheath blight and blast was challenged in open field inoculation. Immunogold detection revealed that RCH10 and AGLU1 proteins were initially located mainly in the chloroplasts and were delivered to the vacuole and cell wall upon infection, suggesting that these subcellular compartments act as the gathering and execution site for these anti-fungal proteins. We also observed that transgenic seeds display lower germination rate and seedling vigor, indicating that defense enhancement might be achieved at the expense of development.",rice sheath blight blast caused rhizoctonia solani kühn magnorpathe oryzae respectively two destructive fungal disease rice genetic natural trait conferring resistance sheath blight transgenic manipulation provides obvious approach study rice basic chitinase gene rch alfalfa βglucanase gene aglu tandemly inserted transformation vector pbi control promoter enhancer sequence generate doubledefense gene expression cassette pz pz cassette transformed rice cv taipei agrobacteriummediated transformation independent transformants obtained confirmed pcr northern analysis inheritable progeny revealed similar level rch aglu transcript individual disease resistance sheath blight blast challenged open field inoculation immunogold detection revealed rch aglu protein initially located mainly chloroplast delivered vacuole cell wall upon infection suggesting subcellular compartment act gathering execution site antifungal protein also observed transgenic seed display lower germination rate seedling vigor indicating defense enhancement might achieved expense development,8,"{'Disease': ['similar level rch aglu transcript individual disease resistance sheath blight blast'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13
32913218,"The overexpression of OsACBP5 protects transgenic rice against necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic and biotrophic pathogens.","The most devastating diseases in rice (Oryza sativa) are sheath blight caused by the fungal necrotroph Rhizoctonia solani, rice blast by hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, and leaf blight by bacterial biotroph Xanthomonas oryzae (Xoo). It has been reported that the Class III acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) such as those from dicots (Arabidopsis and grapevine) play a role in defence against biotrophic pathogens. Of the six Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ACBPs, AtACBP3 conferred protection in transgenic Arabidopsis against Pseudomonas syringae, but not the necrotrophic fungus, Botrytis cinerea. Similar to Arabidopsis, rice possesses six ACBPs, designated OsACBPs. The aims of this study were to test whether OsACBP5, the homologue of AtACBP3, can confer resistance against representative necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic and biotrophic phytopathogens and to understand the mechanisms in protection. Herein, when OsACBP5 was overexpressed in rice, the OsACBP5-overexpressing (OsACBP5-OE) lines exhibited enhanced disease resistance against representative necrotrophic (R. solani & Cercospora oryzae), hemibiotrophic (M. oryzae & Fusarium graminearum) and biotrophic (Xoo) phytopathogens. Progeny from a cross between OsACBP5-OE9 and the jasmonate (JA)-signalling deficient mutant were more susceptible than the wild type to infection by the necrotroph R. solani. In contrast, progeny from a cross between OsACBP5-OE9 and the salicylic acid (SA)-signalling deficient mutant was more susceptible to infection by the hemibiotroph M. oryzae and biotroph Xoo. Hence, enhanced resistance of OsACBP5-OEs against representative necrotrophs appears to be JA-dependent whilst that to (hemi)biotrophs is SA-mediated.",devastating disease rice oryza sativa sheath blight caused fungal necrotroph rhizoctonia solani rice blast hemibiotrophic fungus magnaporthe oryzae leaf blight bacterial biotroph xanthomonas oryzae xoo reported class iii acylcoabinding protein acbps dicot arabidopsis grapevine play role defence biotrophic pathogen six arabidopsis arabidopsis thaliana acbps atacbp conferred protection transgenic arabidopsis pseudomonas syringae necrotrophic fungus botrytis cinerea similar arabidopsis rice possesses six acbps designated osacbps aim study test whether osacbp homologue atacbp confer resistance representative necrotrophic hemibiotrophic biotrophic phytopathogens understand mechanism protection herein osacbp overexpressed rice osacbpoverexpressing osacbpoe line exhibited enhanced disease resistance representative necrotrophic r solani cercospora oryzae hemibiotrophic oryzae fusarium graminearum biotrophic xoo phytopathogens progeny cross osacbpoe jasmonate jasignalling deficient mutant susceptible wild type infection necrotroph r solani contrast progeny cross osacbpoe salicylic acid sasignalling deficient mutant susceptible infection hemibiotroph oryzae biotroph xoo hence enhanced resistance osacbpoes representative necrotrophs appears jadependent whilst hemibiotrophs samediated,8,"{'Disease': ['devastating disease rice oryza sativa sheath blight'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

To identify new ""candidate genes"" having potential role in salinity tolerance, we have carried out 'functional screening' of a cDNA library (made from a salt tolerant rice-Pokkali). Based on this screening, we identified a cDNA clone that was allowing yeast cells to grow in the presence of 1.2 M NaCl. Sequencing and BLAST search identified it as mannose-1-phosphate guanyl transferase (OsMPG1) gene from rice. Analysis of rice genome sequence database indicated the presence of 3 additional genes for MPG. Out of four, three MPG genes viz. OsMPG1, 3 and 4 were able to functionally complement yeast MPG mutant -YDL055C. We have carried out detailed transcript profiling of all members of MPG family by qRT-PCR using two contrasting rice genotypes (IR64 and Pokkali) under different abiotic stresses (salinity, drought, oxidative stress, heat stress, cold or UV light). These MPG genes showed differential expression under various abiotic stresses with two genes (OsMPG1 and 3) showing high induction in response to multiple stresses. Analysis of rice microarray data indicated higher expression levels for OsMPG1 in specific tissues such as roots, leaves, shoot apical meristem and different stages of panicle and seed development, thereby indicating its developmental regulation.

The aims of this study are to analyze genetic diversity of M. oryzae isolates using PCR-based molecular approaches such as RAPD, ISSR, and SRAP and to develop SCAR marker linked to the pathogenicity of rice blast fungus. Twenty Magnaporthe oryzae isolates were collected mainly from the south of Vietnam and assessed for genetic variation by RAPD, ISSR, and SRAP methods. The comparison of those methods was conducted based on the number of polymorphic bands, percentage of polymorphism, PIC values, and phylogenetic analysis. Then, sequenced characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers were developed based on specific bands linked to fungal pathogenicity of rice blast fungus, M. oryzae. The results indicated that SRAP markers yielded the greatest number of polymorphic bands (174) and occupied 51.7% with polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.66. Additionally, the SRAP approach showed stability and high productivity compared with RAPD and ISSR. The SCAR marker developed from the SRAP method identified the presence of the avirulence AVR-pita1 gene involving fungal pathogenicity that can break down blast resistance in rice cultivars.

26471973,"The wheat durable, multipathogen resistance gene Lr34 confers partial blast resistance in rice.","The wheat gene Lr34 confers durable and partial field resistance against the obligate biotrophic, pathogenic rust fungi and powdery mildew in adult wheat plants. The resistant Lr34 allele evolved after wheat domestication through two gain-of-function mutations in an ATP-binding cassette transporter gene. An Lr34-like fungal disease resistance with a similar broad-spectrum specificity and durability has not been described in other cereals. Here, we transformed the resistant Lr34 allele into the japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. Transgenic rice plants expressing Lr34 showed increased resistance against multiple isolates of the hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Host cell invasion during the biotrophic growth phase of rice blast was delayed in Lr34-expressing rice plants, resulting in smaller necrotic lesions on leaves. Lines with Lr34 also developed a typical, senescence-based leaf tip necrosis (LTN) phenotype. Development of LTN during early seedling growth had a negative impact on formation of axillary shoots and spikelets in some transgenic lines. One transgenic line developed LTN only at adult plant stage which was correlated with lower Lr34 expression levels at seedling stage. This line showed normal tiller formation and more importantly, disease resistance in this particular line was not compromised. Interestingly, Lr34 in rice is effective against a hemibiotrophic pathogen with a lifestyle and infection strategy that is different from obligate biotrophic rusts and mildew fungi. Lr34 might therefore be used as a source in rice breeding to improve broad-spectrum disease resistance against the most devastating fungal disease of rice.",wheat gene lr confers durable partial field resistance obligate biotrophic pathogenic rust fungi powdery mildew adult wheat plant resistant lr allele evolved wheat domestication two gainoffunction mutation atpbinding cassette transporter gene lrlike fungal disease resistance similar broadspectrum specificity durability described cereal transformed resistant lr allele japonica rice cultivar nipponbare transgenic rice plant expressing lr showed increased resistance multiple isolates hemibiotrophic pathogen magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease host cell invasion biotrophic growth phase rice blast delayed lrexpressing rice plant resulting smaller necrotic lesion leaf line lr also developed typical senescencebased leaf tip necrosis ltn phenotype development ltn early seedling growth negative impact formation axillary shoot spikelet transgenic line one transgenic line developed ltn adult plant stage correlated lower lr expression level seedling stage line showed normal tiller formation importantly disease resistance particular line compromised interestingly lr rice effective hemibiotrophic pathogen lifestyle infection strategy different obligate biotrophic rust mildew fungi lr might therefore used source rice breeding improve broadspectrum disease resistance devastating fungal disease rice,8,"{'Disease': ['cassette transporter gene lrlike fungal disease resistance similar broadspectrum specificity durability described cereal', 'magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease host cell invasion biotrophic growth phase', 'broadspectrum disease resistance devastating fungal disease rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['growth negative impact formation', 'lr rice effective hemibiotrophic pathogen lifestyle infection strategy different obligate biotrophic rust mildew']}",10

However, it is still unclear how ambient humidity affects the occurrence of diseases in plants. In this study, we show that high ambient humidity enhanced blast development in rice plants under laboratory conditions. Furthermore, we found that high ambient humidity enhanced the virulence of Magnaporthe oryzae by promoting conidial germination and appressorium formation. In addition, the results of RNA-sequencing analysis and the ethylene content assessment revealed that high ambient humidity suppressed the accumulation of ethylene and the activation of ethylene signaling pathway induced by M. oryzae in rice. Knock out of ethylene signaling genes OsEIL1 and OsEIN2 or exogenous application of 1-methylcyclopropene (ethylene inhibitor) and ethephon (ethylene analogues) eliminated the difference of blast resistance between the 70% and 90% relative humidity conditions, suggesting that the activation of ethylene signaling contributes to humidity-modulated basal resistance against M. oryzae in rice.

Current climate and future projections were considered, in the light of the resources required by breeding programs and of the role of weather variables in the identification of promising traits. Results suggest that breeding for traits involved with disease resistance, and tolerance to cold- and heat-induced spikelet sterility could provide benefits similar to those obtained from the improvement of traits involved with canopy structure and photosynthetic efficiency.

33882359,Investigating the cell and developmental biology of plant infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast disease, the most widespread and serious disease of cultivated rice. Live cell imaging and quantitative 4D image analysis have provided new insight into the mechanisms by which the fungus infects host cells and spreads rapidly in plant tissue. In this video review article, we apply live cell imaging approaches to understanding the cell and developmental biology of rice blast disease. To gain entry to host plants, M. oryzae develops a specialised infection structure called an appressorium, a unicellular dome-shaped cell which generates enormous turgor, translated into mechanical force to rupture the leaf cuticle. Appressorium development is induced by perception of the hydrophobic leaf surface and nutrient deprivation. Cargo-independent autophagy in the three-celled conidium, controlled by cell cycle regulation, is essential for appressorium morphogenesis. Appressorium maturation involves turgor generation and melanin pigment deposition in the appressorial cell wall. Once a threshold of turgor has been reached, this triggers re-polarisation which requires regulated generation of reactive oxygen species, to facilitate septin GTPase-dependent cytoskeletal re-organisation and re-polarisation of the appressorium to form a narrow, rigid penetration peg. Infection of host tissue requires a further morphogenetic transition to a pseudohyphal-type of growth within colonised rice cells. At the same time the fungus secretes an arsenal of effector proteins to suppress plant immunity. Many effectors are secreted into host cells directly, which involves a specific secretory pathway and a specialised structure called the biotrophic interfacial complex.

29576481,The Monocot-Specific Receptor-like Kinase SDS2 Controls Cell Death and Immunity in Rice.,"Programmed cell death (PCD) plays critical roles in plant immunity but must be regulated to prevent excessive damage. The E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11 negatively regulates PCD and immunity in plants. We show that SPL11 cell-death suppressor 2 (SDS2), an S-domain receptor-like kinase, positively regulates PCD and immunity in rice by engaging and regulating SPL11 and related kinases controlling defense responses. An sds2 mutant shows reduced immune responses and enhanced susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Conversely, SDS2 over-expression induces constitutive PCD accompanied by elevated immune responses and enhanced resistance to M. oryzae. SDS2 interacts with and phosphorylates SPL11, which in turn ubiquitinates SDS2, leading to its degradation. In addition, SDS2 interacts with related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, OsRLCK118/176, that positively regulate immunity by phosphorylating the NADPH oxidase OsRbohB to stimulate ROS production. Thus, a plasma membrane-resident protein complex consisting of SDS2, SPL11, and OsRLCK118/176 controls PCD and immunity in rice.",programmed cell death pcd play critical role plant immunity must regulated prevent excessive damage e ubiquitin ligase spl negatively regulates pcd immunity plant show spl celldeath suppressor sd sdomain receptorlike kinase positively regulates pcd immunity rice engaging regulating spl related kinase controlling defense response sd mutant show reduced immune response enhanced susceptibility blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae conversely sd overexpression induces constitutive pcd accompanied elevated immune response enhanced resistance oryzae sd interacts phosphorylates spl turn ubiquitinates sd leading degradation addition sd interacts related receptorlike cytoplasmic kinase osrlck positively regulate immunity phosphorylating nadph oxidase osrbohb stimulate ro production thus plasma membraneresident protein complex consisting sd spl osrlck control pcd immunity rice,0,"{'Disease': ['susceptibility blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
33567155,Repressed OsMESL expression triggers reactive oxygen species-mediated broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice.,"A few reports have indicated that a single gene confers resistance to bacterial blight, sheath blight and rice blast. In this study, we identified a novel disease resistance mutant gene, methyl esterase-like (osmesl) in rice. Mutant rice with T-DNA insertion displayed significant resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), sheath blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani and rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout mutants and RNAi lines displayed resistance to these pathogens. Complementary T-DNA mutants demonstrated a phenotype similar to the wild type (WT), thereby indicating that osmesl confers resistance to pathogens. Protein interaction experiments revealed that OsMESL affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by interacting with thioredoxin OsTrxm in rice. Moreover, qRT-PCR results showed significantly reduced mRNA levels of multiple ROS scavenging-related genes in osmesl mutants. Nitroblue tetrazolium staining showed that the pathogens cause ROS accumulation, and quantitative detection revealed significantly increased levels of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in the leaves of osmesl mutants and RNAi lines after infection. The abundance of JA, a hormone associated with disease resistance, was significantly more in osmesl mutants than in WT plants.

The adverse effects of chemicals on the environment are rising concerns for sustainable and eco-friendly approaches. The use of antagonistic microbes for the management of rice blast appears to be a sustainable solution to this challenge. Herein, we isolated 20 Streptomyces strains from rice rhizosphere, among which the isolate STR-2 exhibited maximum inhibition of mycelial growth of M. oryzae accounting for 50% reduction over control. The isolate STR-2 was identified as S. chrestomyceticus through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In vitro tests demonstrated its ability to produce antifungal and bioactive compounds and also synthesize siderophore, IAA, and phosphate-solubilizing agents, thereby promoting plant growth upon inoculation on rice seeds. GC-MS analysis showed the presence of volatiles, antifungal, antimicrobial, and antioxidant compounds with different retention times. The crude antibiotic extract of 0.5% of S. chrestomyceticus STR-2 reduced the mycelial growth of M. oryzae over the control. Application of talc-based formulation of Streptomyces chrestomyceticus STR-2 resulted in the least disease incidence (15.89%) with the highest disease reduction of 65.26% over untreated control under field condition.

36729081,"Overexpression of a beta-1,6-glucanase gene GluM in transgenic rice confers high resistance to rice blast, sheath blight and false smut.","Frequent fungal diseases tend to lead to severe losses in rice production. As a main component of the fungal cell wall, glucan plays an important role in the growth and development of fungi. Glucanase can inhibit the growth of fungi by breaking glycosidic bonds, and may be a promising target for developing rice varieties with broad-spectrum disease resistance. We transferred a codon-optimized β-1,6-glucanase gene (GluM) from myxobacteria into the japonica rice variety Zhonghua11 (ZH11), and obtained a large number of individual transgenic plants with GluM overexpression. Based on molecular analysis, three single-copy homozygous lines with GluM overexpression were selected for assessment of fungal disease resistance at the T<sub>3</sub> generation. Compared with that of the recipient cultivar ZH11, the area of rice blast lesion in transgenic rice was reduced by 82.71%; that of sheath blight lesion was decreased by 35.76%-43.67%; the sheath blight resistance in the field was enhanced by an average of 0.75 grade over 3 years; and the incidence of diseased panicles due to rice false smut was decreased by 65.79%. More importantly, there was no obvious loss of yield (without a significant effect on agronomic traits). Furthermore, plants overexpressing a β-1,6-glucanase gene showed higher disease resistance than rice plants overexpressing a β-1,3-glucanase gene derived from tobacco.

39046037,Defining genomic landscape for identification of potential candidate resistance genes associated with major rice diseases through MetaQTL analysis.,"Rice production is severely affected by various diseases such as bacterial leaf blight (BLB), brown spot (BS), false smut (FS), foot rot (FR), rice blast (RB), and sheath blight (SB). In recent years, several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) studies involving different populations have been carried out, resulting in the identification of hundreds of resistance QTLs for each disease. These QTLs can be integrated and analyzed using meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis for better understanding of the genetic architecture underlying multiple disease resistance (MDR). This study involved an MQTL analysis on 661 QTLs (378, 161, 21, 41, 44, and 16 QTLs for SB, RB, BLB, BS, FS, and FR, respectively) retrieved from 50 individual studies published from 1995 to 2021. Of these, 503 QTLs were projected finally onto the consensus map saturated with 6,275 markers, resulting in 73 MQTLs, including 27 MDR-MQTLs conferring resistance to three or more diseases. Forty-seven MQTLs were validated using marker-trait associations identified in published genome-wide association studies. A total of 3,310 genes, including both R and defense genes, were also identified within some selected high-confidence MQTL regions that were investigated further for the syntenic relationship with barley, wheat, and maize genomes. Thirty-nine high-confidence candidate genes were selected based on their expression patterns and recommended for future studies involving functional validation, genetic engineering, and gene editing. Nineteen MQTLs were co-localized with 39 known R genes for BLB and RB diseases.

36178632,The Piks allele of the NLR immune receptor Pik breaks the recognition of AvrPik effectors of rice blast fungus.,"Arms race co-evolution of plant-pathogen interactions evolved sophisticated recognition mechanisms between host immune receptors and pathogen effectors. Different allelic haplotypes of an immune receptor in the host mount distinct recognition against sequence or non-sequence related effectors in pathogens. We report the molecular characterization of the Piks allele of the rice immune receptor Pik against rice blast pathogen, which requires two head-to-head arrayed nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeat proteins. Like other Pik alleles, both Piks-1 and Piks-2 are necessary and sufficient for mediating resistance. However, unlike other Pik alleles, Piks does not recognize any known AvrPik variants of Magnaporthe oryzae. Sequence analysis of the genome of an avirulent isolate V86010 further revealed that its cognate avirulence (Avr) gene most likely has no significant sequence similarity to known AvrPik variants. Piks-1 and Pikm-1 have only two amino acid differences within the integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain. Pikm-HMA interacts with AvrPik-A, -D, and -E in vitro and in vivo, whereas Piks-HMA does not bind any AvrPik variants. Characterization of two amino acid residues differing Piks-1 from Pikm-1 reveal that Piks-E229Q derived from the exchange of Glu229 to Gln229 in Piks-1 gains recognition specificity against AvrPik-D but not AvrPik-A or -E, indicating that Piks-E229Q partially restores the Pikm spectrum. By contrast, Piks-A261V derived from the exchange of Ala261 to Val261 in Piks-1 retains Piks recognition specificity. We conclude that Glu229 in Piks-1 is critical for Piks breaking the canonical Pik/AvrPik recognition pattern. Intriguingly, binding activity and ectopic cell death induction is maintained between Piks-A261V and AvrPik-D, implying that positive outcomes from ectopic assays might be insufficient to deduce its immune activity against the relevant effectors in rice and rice blast interaction.",arm race coevolution plantpathogen interaction evolved sophisticated recognition mechanism host immune receptor pathogen effector different allelic haplotype immune receptor host mount distinct recognition sequence nonsequence related effector pathogen report molecular characterization piks allele rice immune receptor pik rice blast pathogen requires two headtohead arrayed nucleotidebinding site leucinerich repeat protein like pik allele piks piks necessary sufficient mediating resistance however unlike pik allele piks recognize known avrpik variant magnaporthe oryzae sequence analysis genome avirulent isolate v revealed cognate avirulence avr gene likely significant sequence similarity known avrpik variant piks pikm two amino acid difference within integrated heavy metalassociated hma domain pikmhma interacts avrpika e vitro vivo whereas pikshma bind avrpik variant characterization two amino acid residue differing piks pikm reveal pikseq derived exchange glu gln piks gain recognition specificity avrpikd avrpika e indicating pikseq partially restores pikm spectrum contrast piksav derived exchange ala val piks retains piks recognition specificity conclude glu piks critical piks breaking canonical pikavrpik recognition pattern intriguingly binding activity ectopic cell death induction maintained piksav avrpikd implying positive outcome ectopic assay might insufficient deduce immune activity relevant effector rice rice blast interaction,1,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effector different allelic haplotype immune receptor host', 'distinct recognition sequence nonsequence related effector pathogen', 'might insufficient deduce immune activity relevant effector rice rice blast interaction']}",5

OsMPK3 and OsbHLH65 are induced by biotic stress and defense-related hormones. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in the majority of signaling pathways that regulate plant development and stress tolerance via the phosphorylation of target molecules. Plant MAPKs are classified into two subtypes, TEY and TDY, according to the TxY (x = E or D) motif in their activation loop, and the TDY motif is unique to plant MAPKs.

We previously reported the MoHTR1, a nuclear effector of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. MoHTR1 is translocated to rice nuclei but not in fungal nuclei. Here, we identify the core NLS (RxKK) responsible for MoHTR1's nuclear localization. MoHTR1 is translocated in the host nucleus through interaction with rice importin α. MoHTR1 NLS empowers it to translocate the cytoplasmic effectors of M. oryzae into rice nuclei. Furthermore, other nuclear effector candidates of the blast pathogen and rice proteins which have RxKK also exhibit nuclear localization, highlighting the crucial role of RxKK in this process. We also unveil the importance of SUMOylation in the stability of MoHTR1 and translocation of MoHTR1 to host nuclei. Moreover, MoHTR1 NLS is essential for the pathogenicity of M. oryzae by reprogramming immunity-associated genes in the host.

A total of 1154 differentially expressing genes were identified in TP-Pi54 plants. Of these, 587 were up-regulated, whereas 567 genes were found to be down-regulated. 107 genes were found that were exclusively up-regulated and 58 genes that were down- regulated in the case of TP-Pi54. Various defence response genes, such as callose, laccase, PAL, and peroxidase, and genes related to transcription factors like NAC6, Dof zinc finger, MAD box, bZIP, and WRKY were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic line.

38483039,MoAti1 mediates mitophagy by facilitating recruitment of MoAtg8 to promote invasive growth in Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Mitophagy is a selective autophagy for the degradation of damaged or excessive mitochondria to maintain intracellular homeostasis. In Magnaporthe oryzae, a filamentous ascomycetous fungus that causes rice blast, the most devastating disease of rice, mitophagy occurs in the invasive hyphae to promote infection. To date, only a few proteins are known to participate in mitophagy and the mechanisms of mitophagy are largely unknown in pathogenic fungi. Here, by a yeast two-hybrid screen with the core autophagy-related protein MoAtg8 as a bait, we obtained a MoAtg8 interactor MoAti1 (MoAtg8-interacting protein 1). Fluorescent observations and protease digestion analyses revealed that MoAti1 is primarily localized to the peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane and is responsible for recruiting MoAtg8 to mitochondria under mitophagy induction conditions. MoAti1 is specifically required for mitophagy, but not for macroautophagy and pexophagy. Infection assays suggested that MoAti1 is required for mitophagy in invasive hyphae during pathogenesis. Notably, no homologues of MoAti1 were found in rice and human protein databases, indicating that MoAti1 may be used as a potential target to control rice blast. By the host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) strategy, transgenic rice plants targeted to silencing MoATI1 showed enhanced resistance against M. oryzae with unchanged agronomic traits.

Sequencing analysis showed that all PR mutants presented a cytosine-to-thymine transition at nucleotide position +1218, resulting in a replacement of histidine 245 by tyrosine (H245Y) on MoSdhB. The mutation of MoSdhB exhibited strong resistant phenotype, but no detectable growth deficits in fungal development, including vegetative growth and pathogenicity of M. oryzae. An allele-specific PCR for rapid detection of the H245Y mutants was established in M. oryzae. The M. oryzae is sensitive to pydiflumetofen, and shows a medium to high resistance risk to pydiflumetofen.

17947408,The blast resistance gene Pi37 encodes a nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat protein and is a member of a resistance gene cluster on rice chromosome 1.,"The resistance (R) gene Pi37, present in the rice cultivar St. No. 1, was isolated by an in silico map-based cloning procedure. The equivalent genetic region in Nipponbare contains four nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type loci. These four candidates for Pi37 (Pi37-1, -2, -3, and -4) were amplified separately from St. No. 1 via long-range PCR, and cloned into a binary vector. Each construct was individually transformed into the highly blast susceptible cultivar Q1063. The subsequent complementation analysis revealed Pi37-3 to be the functional gene, while -1, -2, and -4 are probably pseudogenes. Pi37 encodes a 1290 peptide NBS-LRR product, and the presence of substitutions at two sites in the NBS region (V239A and I247M) is associated with the resistance phenotype. Semiquantitative expression analysis showed that in St. No. 1, Pi37 was constitutively expressed and only slightly induced by blast infection. Transient expression experiments indicated that the Pi37 product is restricted to the cytoplasm. Pi37-3 is thought to have evolved recently from -2, which in turn was derived from an ancestral -1 sequence. Pi37-4 is likely the most recently evolved member of the cluster and probably represents a duplication of -3.

26864209,A chloroplast-localized protein LESION AND LAMINA BENDING affects defence and growth responses in rice.,"Understanding how plants allocate their resources to growth or defence is of long-term importance to the development of new and improved varieties of different crops. Using molecular genetics, plant physiology, hormone analysis and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based transcript profiling, we have isolated and characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) LESION AND LAMINA BENDING (LLB) gene that encodes a chloroplast-targeted putative leucine carboxyl methyltransferase. Loss of LLB function results in reduced growth and yield, hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions, accumulation of the antimicrobial compounds momilactones and phytocassanes, and constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes. Consistent with these defence-associated responses, llb shows enhanced resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). The lesion and resistance phenotypes are likely to be caused by the over-accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) in the llb mutant including the JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid. Additionally, llb shows an increased lamina inclination and enhanced early seedling growth due to elevated brassinosteroid (BR) synthesis and/or signalling. These findings show that LLB functions in the chloroplast to either directly or indirectly repress both JA- and BR-mediated responses, revealing a possible mechanism for controlling how plants allocate resources for defence and growth.",understanding plant allocate resource growth defence longterm importance development new improved variety different crop using molecular genetics plant physiology hormone analysis nextgeneration sequencing ngsbased transcript profiling isolated characterized rice oryza sativa lesion lamina bending llb gene encodes chloroplasttargeted putative leucine carboxyl methyltransferase loss llb function result reduced growth yield hypersensitive response hrlike lesion accumulation antimicrobial compound momilactones phytocassanes constitutive expression pathogenesisrelated gene consistent defenceassociated response llb show enhanced resistance rice blast magnaporthe oryzae bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae lesion resistance phenotype likely caused overaccumulation jasmonates jas llb mutant including ja precursor oxophytodienoic acid additionally llb show increased lamina inclination enhanced early seedling growth due elevated brassinosteroid br synthesis andor signalling finding show llb function chloroplast either directly indirectly repress ja brmediated response revealing possible mechanism controlling plant allocate resource defence growth,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10

We have previously used 18:3- and JA-deficient rice (F78Ri) to investigate the roles of fatty acids and their derivatives in resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea [A. Yara, T.

However, because F78Ri plants are suppressed in the first step of the JA biosynthetic pathway, we could not confirm the specific contribution of JA to disease resistance. In this paper, we generated two JA-deficient rice lines (AOCRi and OPRRi) with suppressed expression of the genes encoding allene oxide cyclase (AOC) and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase (OPR), which catalyze late steps in the JA biosynthetic pathway. The levels of disease resistance in the AOCRi and OPRRi lines were equal to that in wild-type plants.

31519258,The antifungal action mode of the rice endophyte Streptomyces hygroscopicus OsiSh-2 as a potential biocontrol agent against the rice blast pathogen.,"Microbial antagonists and their bioactive metabolites provide one of the best alternatives to chemical pesticides to control crop disease for sustainable agriculture and global food security. The rice endophyte Streptomyces hygroscopicus OsiSh-2, with remarkable antagonistic activity towards the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, was reported in our previous study. The present study deciphered the possible direct interaction mode of OsiSh-2 against M. oryzae. An in vitro antibiotic assay for OsiSh-2 culture filtrate revealed strong suppression of mycelial growth, conidial germination and appressorial formation of M. oryzae. Meanwhile, severe morphological and internal abnormalities in M. oryzae hyphae were observed under a scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Foliar treatment of rice seedlings by OsiSh-2 culture filtrate in the greenhouse and in the field showed 23.5% and 28.3% disease reduction, respectively. Correspondingly, OsiSh-2 culture filtrate could induce disorganized chitin deposition in the cell wall and lowered ergosterol content in the cell membrane of M. oryzae. Additionally, cell wall integrity pathway activation, large cell electrolytes release, reactive oxygen species accumulation and tricarboxylic acid cycle-related enzyme activity changes were found in M. oryzae. All these results suggested that the direct antagonistic activity of OsiSh-2 against M. oryzae may be attributed to damaging the integrity of the cell wall and membrane and disrupting mitochondrial function in the pathogen.",microbial antagonist bioactive metabolite provide one best alternative chemical pesticide control crop disease sustainable agriculture global food security rice endophyte streptomyces hygroscopicus osish remarkable antagonistic activity towards rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae reported previous study present study deciphered possible direct interaction mode osish oryzae vitro antibiotic assay osish culture filtrate revealed strong suppression mycelial growth conidial germination appressorial formation oryzae meanwhile severe morphological internal abnormality oryzae hypha observed scanning electron microscope transmission electron microscope foliar treatment rice seedling osish culture filtrate greenhouse field showed disease reduction respectively correspondingly osish culture filtrate could induce disorganized chitin deposition cell wall lowered ergosterol content cell membrane oryzae additionally cell wall integrity pathway activation large cell electrolyte release reactive oxygen specie accumulation tricarboxylic acid cyclerelated enzyme activity change found oryzae result suggested direct antagonistic activity osish oryzae may attributed damaging integrity cell wall membrane disrupting mitochondrial function pathogen,3,"{'Disease': ['one best alternative chemical pesticide control crop disease sustainable agriculture global food security rice endophyte streptomyces hygroscopicus osish remarkable antagonistic activity', 'rice blast fungus', 'disease reduction'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",11

OsBIDK1 contains a conserved DGK domain, consisting of a diacylglycerol kinase catalytic subdomain and a diacylglycerol kinase accessory subdomain. Expression of OsBIDK1 in rice seedlings was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of the plant defense response, and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of blast disease. In BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIDK1 was induced earlier and at a higher level than in water-treated control seedlings after inoculation with M. grisea. Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express the OsBIDK1 gene were generated and disease resistance assays showed that overexpression of OsBIDK1 in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in enhanced resistance against infection by tobacco mosaic virus and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae.

33694285,Tandem DNA repeats contain cis-regulatory sequences that activate biotrophy-specific expression of Magnaporthe effector gene PWL2.,"During plant infection, fungi secrete effector proteins in coordination with distinct infection stages. Thus, the success of plant infection is determined by precise control of effector gene expression. We analysed the PWL2 effector gene of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae to understand how effector genes are activated specifically during the early biotrophic stages of rice infection. Here, we used confocal live-cell imaging of M. oryzae transformants with various PWL2 promoter fragments fused to sensitive green fluorescent protein reporter genes to determine the expression patterns of PWL2 at the cellular level, together with quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses at the tissue level. We found PWL2 expression was coupled with sequential biotrophic invasion of rice cells. PWL2 expression was induced in the appressorium upon penetration into a living rice cell but greatly declined in the highly branched hyphae when the first-invaded rice cell was dead. PWL2 expression then increased again as the hyphae penetrate into living adjacent cells. The expression of PWL2 required fungal penetration into living plant cells of either host rice or nonhost onion. Deletion and mutagenesis experiments further revealed that the tandem repeats in the PWL2 promoter contain 12-base pair sequences required for expression. We conclude that PWL2 expression is (a) activated by an unknown signal commonly present in living plant cells, (b) specific to biotrophic stages of fungal infection, and (c) requires 12-base pair cis-regulatory sequences in the promoter.",plant infection fungi secrete effector protein coordination distinct infection stage thus success plant infection determined precise control effector gene expression analysed pwl effector gene rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae understand effector gene activated specifically early biotrophic stage rice infection used confocal livecell imaging oryzae transformants various pwl promoter fragment fused sensitive green fluorescent protein reporter gene determine expression pattern pwl cellular level together quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis tissue level found pwl expression coupled sequential biotrophic invasion rice cell pwl expression induced appressorium upon penetration living rice cell greatly declined highly branched hypha firstinvaded rice cell dead pwl expression increased hypha penetrate living adjacent cell expression pwl required fungal penetration living plant cell either host rice nonhost onion deletion mutagenesis experiment revealed tandem repeat pwl promoter contain base pair sequence required expression conclude pwl expression activated unknown signal commonly present living plant cell b specific biotrophic stage fungal infection c requires base pair cisregulatory sequence promoter,3,"{'Disease': ['pwl effector gene rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['secrete effector protein coordination distinct infection stage', 'precise control effector gene expression', 'pwl effector gene rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'effector gene']}",7
29633975,Crystallization of the rice immune receptor RGA5A_S with the rice blast fungus effector AVR1-CO39 prepared via mixture and tandem strategies.,"RGA5 is a component of the Pia resistance-protein pair (RGA4/RGA5) from Oryza sativa L. japonica. It acts as an immune receptor that directly recognizes the effector AVR1-CO39 from Magnaporthe oryzae via a C-terminal non-LRR domain (RGA5A_S). The interaction between RGA5A_S and AVR1-CO39 relieves the repression of RGA4, leading to effector-independent cell death. To determine the structure of the complex of RGA5A_S and AVR1-CO39 and to understand the details of this interaction, the complex was prepared by fusing the proteins together, by mixing them in vitro or by co-expressing them in one host cell. Samples purified via the first two strategies were crystallized under two different conditions. A mixture of AVR1-CO39 and RGA5A_S (complex I) crystallized in 1.1 M ammonium tartrate dibasic, 0.1 M sodium acetate-HCl pH 4.6, while crystals of the fusion complex RGA5A_S-TEV-AVR1-CO39 (complex II) were grown in 2 M NaCl.

31973846,Effects of camptothecin on the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch is one of the most devastating diseases on rice. Camptothecin (CPT), which was primarily isolated from Camptotheca acuminata, is well-known for its anti-tumor activities, and is also developed as a potential biological pesticide. We previously investigated the anti-microbial activities of CPT against 11 fungi, 3 oomycetes, and 4 bacteria, and found that CPT was strongly effective against M. oryzae, indicating its potential as a lead for developing fungicide against rice blast. However, the anti-fungal effects of CPT on M. oryzae need further elucidation. In this study, the anti-fungal activities of CPT against M. oryzae were further investigated, which revealed that CPT was effective against M. oryzae both in vitro and in vivo. The transcriptome of M. oryzae was analyzed after CPT treatment, which showed that CPT had a strong inhibitory effect on 'translation' and 'carbohydrate metabolism/energy metabolism' of M. oryzae. Some physiology characteristics of M. oryzae were also assayed, which confirmed that CPT inhibited RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism/energy metabolism of M. oryzae, and caused membrane damage. The molecular simulation result showed that CPT binds to the interface of DNA-topoisomerase I complex of M. oryzae. In conclusion, CPT is a promising lead for developing fungicide against rice blast. CPT may bind to DNA-topoisomerase I complex of M. oryzae, thus affecting 'translation' and 'carbohydrate metabolism/energy metabolism', leading to cell death.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae b couch one devastating disease rice camptothecin cpt primarily isolated camptotheca acuminata wellknown antitumor activity also developed potential biological pesticide previously investigated antimicrobial activity cpt fungi oomycetes bacteria found cpt strongly effective oryzae indicating potential lead developing fungicide rice blast however antifungal effect cpt oryzae need elucidation study antifungal activity cpt oryzae investigated revealed cpt effective oryzae vitro vivo transcriptome oryzae analyzed cpt treatment showed cpt strong inhibitory effect translation carbohydrate metabolismenergy metabolism oryzae physiology characteristic oryzae also assayed confirmed cpt inhibited rna synthesis protein synthesis carbohydrate metabolismenergy metabolism oryzae caused membrane damage molecular simulation result showed cpt bind interface dnatopoisomerase complex oryzae conclusion cpt promising lead developing fungicide rice blast cpt may bind dnatopoisomerase complex oryzae thus affecting translation carbohydrate metabolismenergy metabolism leading cell death,0,"{'Disease': ['one devastating disease rice camptothecin cpt'], 'Treatment': ['transcriptome oryzae analyzed cpt treatment'], 'Symptom': ['fungicide rice blast however antifungal effect cpt oryzae']}",11
25706446,Allele Mining Strategies: Principles and Utilisation for Blast Resistance Genes in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).,"Allele mining is a promising way to dissect naturally occurring allelic variants of candidate genes with essential agronomic qualities. With the identification, isolation and characterisation of blast resistance genes in rice, it is now possible to dissect the actual allelic variants of these genes within an array of rice cultivars via allele mining. Multiple alleles from the complex locus serve as a reservoir of variation to generate functional genes. The routine sequence exchange is one of the main mechanisms of R gene evolution and development. Allele mining for resistance genes can be an important method to identify additional resistance alleles and new haplotypes along with the development of allele-specific markers for use in marker-assisted selection. Allele mining can be visualised as a vital link between effective utilisation of genetic and genomic resources in genomics-driven modern plant breeding. This review studies the actual concepts and potential of mining approaches for the discovery of alleles and their utilisation for blast resistance genes in rice.

28028232,Two independent S-phase checkpoints regulate appressorium-mediated plant infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"To cause rice blast disease, the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae develops a specialized infection structure called an appressorium. This dome-shaped, melanin-pigmented cell generates enormous turgor and applies physical force to rupture the rice leaf cuticle using a rigid penetration peg. Appressorium-mediated infection requires septin-dependent reorientation of the F-actin cytoskeleton at the base of the infection cell, which organizes polarity determinants necessary for plant cell invasion. Here, we show that plant infection by M. oryzae requires two independent S-phase cell-cycle checkpoints. Initial formation of appressoria on the rice leaf surface requires an S-phase checkpoint that acts through the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, involving the Cds1 kinase. By contrast, appressorium repolarization involves a novel, DDR-independent S-phase checkpoint, triggered by appressorium turgor generation and melanization. This second checkpoint specifically regulates septin-dependent, NADPH oxidase-regulated F-actin dynamics to organize the appressorium pore and facilitate entry of the fungus into host tissue.",cause rice blast disease fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae develops specialized infection structure called appressorium domeshaped melaninpigmented cell generates enormous turgor applies physical force rupture rice leaf cuticle using rigid penetration peg appressoriummediated infection requires septindependent reorientation factin cytoskeleton base infection cell organizes polarity determinant necessary plant cell invasion show plant infection oryzae requires two independent sphase cellcycle checkpoint initial formation appressoria rice leaf surface requires sphase checkpoint act dna damage response ddr pathway involving cd kinase contrast appressorium repolarization involves novel ddrindependent sphase checkpoint triggered appressorium turgor generation melanization second checkpoint specifically regulates septindependent nadph oxidaseregulated factin dynamic organize appressorium pore facilitate entry fungus host tissue,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease fungal pathogen', 'factin dynamic organize appressorium pore facilitate entry fungus host tissue'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

Nested modified-AFLP using Tos17-specific primers and southern hybridization experiments of segregating individuals indicated that the lesion mimic phenotype in NF4050-8 is most likely due to a nucleotide change acquired during the culturing process and not due to Tos17 insertion per se. Inheritance and genetic analyses in two japonica × indica populations identified an overlapping genomic region of 13 cM on short arm of chromosome 7 that was linked with the lesion mimic phenotype. High-resolution genetic mapping using 950 F(3) and 3,821 F(4) plants of NF4050-8 × CO39 delimited a 35 kb region flanked by NBARC1 (5.262 Mb) and RM8262 (5.297 Mb), which contained 6 ORFs; 3 of them were 'resistance gene related' with typical NBS-LRR signatures.

23289725,QTL-seq: rapid mapping of quantitative trait loci in rice by whole genome resequencing of DNA from two bulked populations.,"The majority of agronomically important crop traits are quantitative, meaning that they are controlled by multiple genes each with a small effect (quantitative trait loci, QTLs). Mapping and isolation of QTLs is important for efficient crop breeding by marker-assisted selection (MAS) and for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the traits. However, since it requires the development and selection of DNA markers for linkage analysis, QTL analysis has been time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here we report the rapid identification of plant QTLs by whole-genome resequencing of DNAs from two populations each composed of 20-50 individuals showing extreme opposite trait values for a given phenotype in a segregating progeny. We propose to name this approach QTL-seq as applied to plant species. We applied QTL-seq to rice recombinant inbred lines and F2 populations and successfully identified QTLs for important agronomic traits, such as partial resistance to the fungal rice blast disease and seedling vigor.

Two sequences, OsMlo-1 and DFR-1 which were homologous to the barley Mlo and maize Hm1, respectively, were isolated from rice. The OsMlo-1 was mapped between two molecular markers, RZ667 and RG424, and located at a distance of 20.6 centi-Morgan (cM) from RZ667 and 6.0 cM from RG424 on rice chromosome 6. The DFR-1 was flanked by molecular markers R2635 and RG462 with an estimated genetic distance of 11.3 cM from R2635 and 23.9 cM from RG462 on rice chromosome 1.

35217224,Warm temperature compromises JA-regulated basal resistance to enhance Magnaporthe oryzae infection in rice.,"Changes in global temperatures profoundly affect the occurrence of plant diseases. It is well known that rice blast can easily become epidemic in relatively warm weather. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we show that enhanced blast development at a warm temperature (22°C) compared with the normal growth temperature (28°C) is rice plant-determined. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling genes in rice could be effectively induced by Magnaporthe oryzae at 28°C but not at 22°C. Phenotypic analyses of the osaoc1 and osmyc2 mutants, OsCOI1 RNAi lines, and OsMYC2-OE plants further demonstrated that compromised M. oryzae-induced JA biosynthesis and signaling lead to enhanced blast susceptibility at the warm temperature. Consistent with these results, we found that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate served as an effective strategy for improving blast resistance under the warm environmental conditions. Furthermore, decreased activation of JA signaling resulted in the downregulated expression of some key basal resistance genes at 22°C when compared with 28°C. Among these affected genes, OsCEBiP (chitin elicitor-binding protein precursor) was found to be directly regulated by OsMYB22 and its interacting protein OsMYC2, a key component of JA signaling, and this contributed to temperature-modulated blast resistance. Taken together, these results suggest that warm temperature compromises basal resistance in rice and enhances M. oryzae infection by reducing JA biosynthesis and signaling, providing potential new strategies for managing rice blast disease under warm climate conditions.",change global temperature profoundly affect occurrence plant disease well known rice blast easily become epidemic relatively warm weather however molecular mechanism remains unclear study show enhanced blast development warm temperature °c compared normal growth temperature °c rice plantdetermined comparative transcriptome analysis revealed jasmonic acid ja biosynthesis signaling gene rice could effectively induced magnaporthe oryzae °c °c phenotypic analysis osaoc osmyc mutant oscoi rnai line osmycoe plant demonstrated compromised oryzaeinduced ja biosynthesis signaling lead enhanced blast susceptibility warm temperature consistent result found exogenous application methyl jasmonate served effective strategy improving blast resistance warm environmental condition furthermore decreased activation ja signaling resulted downregulated expression key basal resistance gene °c compared °c among affected gene oscebip chitin elicitorbinding protein precursor found directly regulated osmyb interacting protein osmyc key component ja signaling contributed temperaturemodulated blast resistance taken together result suggest warm temperature compromise basal resistance rice enhances oryzae infection reducing ja biosynthesis signaling providing potential new strategy managing rice blast disease warm climate condition,4,"{'Disease': ['occurrence plant disease', 'rice blast disease warm climate condition'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effective strategy']}",8

The interaction between AVR-pita gene in Magnaporthe grsiea and Pi-ta gene in rice is a classical gene-for-gene system. The genetic diversity of AVR-pita alleles was showed by 44 isolates from the fields in Sichuan and Chongqing. According to the published sequence of AVR-pita (GenBank Accession No. AF207841), the special primers were designed and a population analysis of AVR-pita occurrence in the field was conducted. The PCR negative isolates did not trigger host resistance responses and the disease might occur. The positive special PCR band in an isolate was not corresponding with its avirulence to the Pi-ta rice line.

34236687,Molecular Detection of Magnaporthe oryzae from Rice Seeds.,"Rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide. Blast pathogen infects all stages of rice causing leaf, collar, neck, and panicle blast symptoms. Seedlings infested by M. oryzae serve as an inoculum source, which gradually causes the disease symptoms on rice leaves. Hence, for the blast disease management, it is crucial to detect the pathogen in rice seeds, particularly at the presymptomatic stage. Early pathogen diagnosis enhances the accuracy and timing of fungicide applications, thereby improving their efficiency. Moreover, detection of infested seeds is important for the quarantine purposes to ensure the flow of quality rice seeds to the market. In this chapter, a PCR-based assay is described to detect the blast pathogen from rice seeds. The ability of this molecular method in reliably detecting pathogens can prevent the spread of blast disease because of its increased sensitivity and the reduction of diagnostic time.",rice blast disease caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating disease rice worldwide blast pathogen infects stage rice causing leaf collar neck panicle blast symptom seedling infested oryzae serve inoculum source gradually cause disease symptom rice leaf hence blast disease management crucial detect pathogen rice seed particularly presymptomatic stage early pathogen diagnosis enhances accuracy timing fungicide application thereby improving efficiency moreover detection infested seed important quarantine purpose ensure flow quality rice seed market chapter pcrbased assay described detect blast pathogen rice seed ability molecular method reliably detecting pathogen prevent spread blast disease increased sensitivity reduction diagnostic time,8,"{'Disease': ['rice blast disease', 'fungus magnaporthe', 'one devastating disease rice worldwide blast pathogen infects stage rice', 'disease symptom rice leaf hence blast disease management crucial detect pathogen rice seed', 'pathogen prevent spread blast disease'], 'Treatment': ['disease symptom rice leaf hence blast disease management crucial detect pathogen rice seed', 'molecular method'], 'Symptom': ['leaf collar neck panicle blast symptom seedling', 'disease symptom rice leaf hence blast disease management crucial detect pathogen rice seed', 'particularly presymptomatic stage']}",9
17036061,"Genetic analysis and molecular mapping of the avirulence gene PRE1, a gene for host-species specificity in the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.","We analyzed host-species specificity of Magnaporthe grisea on rice using 110 F1 progeny derived from a cross between the Oryza isolate CH87 (pathogenic to rice) and the Digitaria isolate 6023 (pathogenic to crabgrass). To elucidate the genetic mechanisms controlling species specificity in M. grisea, we performed a genetic analysis of species-specific avirulence on this rice population. Avirulent and virulent progeny segregated in a 1:1 ratio on the 2 rice cultivars 'Lijiangxintuanheigu' (LTH) and 'Shin2', suggesting that a single locus, designated PRE1, was involved in the specificity. In a combination between 'Kusabue' and 'Tsuyuake', the segregation of the 4 possible phenotypes of F1 progeny was significantly different from the expected 3:1:3:1 and instead fit a ratio of 2:0:1:1. This indicated that 2 loci, PRE1 and AVR2, were involved in specific parasitism on rice. These results suggest that the species specificity of M. grisea on rice is governed by species-dependent genetic mechanisms that are similar to the gene-for-gene interactions controlling cultivar specificity. Pathogenicity tests with various plant species revealed that the Digitaria isolate 6023 was exclusively parasitic on crabgrass. Genetic linkage analysis showed that PRE1 was mapped on chromosome 3 with respect to RAPD and SSR markers. RAPD marker S361 was linked to the avirulence gene at a distance of ~6.4 cM. Two SSR markers, m677-678 and m77-78, were linked to the PRE1 gene on M. grisea chromosome 3 at distances of 5.9 and 7.1 cM, respectively.

31517594,Genetic evidence for <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> vitamin B3 acquisition from rice cells.,"Following penetration, the devastating rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, like some other important eukaryotic phytopathogens, grows in intimate contact with living plant cells before causing disease. Cell-to-cell growth during this biotrophic growth stage must involve nutrient acquisition, but experimental evidence for the internalization and metabolism of host-derived compounds is exceedingly sparse. This striking gap in our knowledge of the infection process undermines accurate conceptualization of the plant-fungal interaction. Here, through our general interest in <i>Magnaporthe</i> metabolism and with a specific focus on the signalling and redox cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), we deleted the <i>M. oryzae QPT1</i> gene encoding quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase, catalyst of the last step in <i>de novo</i> NAD biosynthesis from tryptophan. We show how <i>QPT1</i> is essential for axenic growth on minimal media lacking nicotinic acid (NA, an importable NAD precursor). However, Δ<i>qpt1</i> mutant strains were fully pathogenic, indicating <i>de novo</i> NAD biosynthesis is dispensable for lesion expansion following invasive hyphal growth in leaf tissue. Because overcoming the loss of <i>de novo</i> NAD biosynthesis <i>in planta</i> can only occur if importable NAD precursors (which solely comprise the NA, nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside forms of vitamin B3) are accessible, we unexpectedly but unequivocally demonstrate that vitamin B3 can be acquired from the host and assimilated into <i>Magnaporthe</i> metabolism during growth in rice cells.

22448240,Infection-associated nuclear degeneration in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae requires non-selective macro-autophagy.,"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae elaborates a specialized infection structure called an appressorium to breach the rice leaf surface and gain access to plant tissue. Appressorium development is controlled by cell cycle progression, and a single round of nuclear division occurs prior to appressorium formation. Mitosis is always followed by programmed cell death of the spore from which the appressorium develops. Nuclear degeneration in the spore is known to be essential for plant infection, but the precise mechanism by which it occurs is not known. In yeast, nuclear breakdown requires a specific form of autophagy, known as piecemeal microautophagy of the nucleus (PMN), and we therefore investigated whether this process occurs in the rice blast fungus. Here, we report that M. oryzae possesses two conserved components of a putative PMN pathway, MoVac8 and MoTsc13, but that both are dispensable for nuclear breakdown during plant infection. MoVAC8 encodes a vacuolar membrane protein and MoTSC13 a peri-nuclear and peripheral ER protein. We show that MoVAC8 is necessary for caffeine resistance, but dispensable for pathogenicity of M. oryzae, while MoTSC13 is involved in cell wall stress responses and is an important virulence determinant. By functional analysis of ΔMoatg1 and ΔMoatg4 mutants, we demonstrate that infection-associated nuclear degeneration in M. oryzae instead occurs by non-selective macroautophagy, which is necessary for rice blast disease.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae elaborates specialized infection structure called appressorium breach rice leaf surface gain access plant tissue appressorium development controlled cell cycle progression single round nuclear division occurs prior appressorium formation mitosis always followed programmed cell death spore appressorium develops nuclear degeneration spore known essential plant infection precise mechanism occurs known yeast nuclear breakdown requires specific form autophagy known piecemeal microautophagy nucleus pmn therefore investigated whether process occurs rice blast fungus report oryzae possesses two conserved component putative pmn pathway movac motsc dispensable nuclear breakdown plant infection movac encodes vacuolar membrane protein motsc perinuclear peripheral er protein show movac necessary caffeine resistance dispensable pathogenicity oryzae motsc involved cell wall stress response important virulence determinant functional analysis δmoatg δmoatg mutant demonstrate infectionassociated nuclear degeneration oryzae instead occurs nonselective macroautophagy necessary rice blast disease,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae elaborates', 'rice blast fungus report', 'nonselective macroautophagy necessary rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
23874666,A systems-genetics approach and data mining tool to assist in the discovery of genes underlying complex traits in Oryza sativa.,"Many traits of biological and agronomic significance in plants are controlled in a complex manner where multiple genes and environmental signals affect the expression of the phenotype. In Oryza sativa (rice), thousands of quantitative genetic signals have been mapped to the rice genome. In parallel, thousands of gene expression profiles have been generated across many experimental conditions. Through the discovery of networks with real gene co-expression relationships, it is possible to identify co-localized genetic and gene expression signals that implicate complex genotype-phenotype relationships. In this work, we used a knowledge-independent, systems genetics approach, to discover a high-quality set of co-expression networks, termed Gene Interaction Layers (GILs). Twenty-two GILs were constructed from 1,306 Affymetrix microarray rice expression profiles that were pre-clustered to allow for improved capture of gene co-expression relationships. Functional genomic and genetic data, including over 8,000 QTLs and 766 phenotype-tagged SNPs (p-value < = 0.001) from genome-wide association studies, both covering over 230 different rice traits were integrated with the GILs. An online systems genetics data-mining resource, the GeneNet Engine, was constructed to enable dynamic discovery of gene sets (i.e. network modules) that overlap with genetic traits. GeneNet Engine does not provide the exact set of genes underlying a given complex trait, but through the evidence of gene-marker correspondence, co-expression, and functional enrichment, site visitors can identify genes with potential shared causality for a trait which could then be used for experimental validation. A set of 2 million SNPs was incorporated into the database and serve as a potential set of testable biomarkers for genes in modules that overlap with genetic traits. Herein, we describe two modules found using GeneNet Engine, one with significant overlap with the trait amylose content and another with significant overlap with blast disease resistance.",many trait biological agronomic significance plant controlled complex manner multiple gene environmental signal affect expression phenotype oryza sativa rice thousand quantitative genetic signal mapped rice genome parallel thousand gene expression profile generated across many experimental condition discovery network real gene coexpression relationship possible identify colocalized genetic gene expression signal implicate complex genotypephenotype relationship work used knowledgeindependent system genetics approach discover highquality set coexpression network termed gene interaction layer gils twentytwo gils constructed affymetrix microarray rice expression profile preclustered allow improved capture gene coexpression relationship functional genomic genetic data including qtls phenotypetagged snp pvalue genomewide association study covering different rice trait integrated gils online system genetics datamining resource genenet engine constructed enable dynamic discovery gene set ie network module overlap genetic trait genenet engine provide exact set gene underlying given complex trait evidence genemarker correspondence coexpression functional enrichment site visitor identify gene potential shared causality trait could used experimental validation set million snp incorporated database serve potential set testable biomarkers gene module overlap genetic trait herein describe two module found using genenet engine one significant overlap trait amylose content another significant overlap blast disease resistance,2,"{'Disease': ['another significant overlap blast disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13
21883553,A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK12 oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance.,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) regulate the downstream components in calcium signaling pathways. We investigated the effects of overexpression and disruption of an Oryza sativa (rice) CDPK (OsCPK12) on the plant's response to abiotic and biotic stresses. OsCPK12-overexpressing (OsCPK12-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress. The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) in the leaves was less in OsCPK12-OX plants than in wild-type (WT) plants. Genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes (OsAPx2 and OsAPx8) were more highly expressed in OsCPK12-OX plants than in WT plants, whereas the expression of the NADPH oxidase gene, OsrbohI, was decreased in OsCPK12-OX plants compared with WT plants. Conversely, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion mutant, oscpk12, and plants transformed with an OsCPK12 RNA interference (RNAi) construct were more sensitive to high salinity than were WT plants. The level of H(2) O(2) accumulation was greater in oscpk12 and OsCPK12 RNAi plants than in the WT. These results suggest that OsCPK12 promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS. We also observed that OsCPK12-OX seedlings had increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and increased susceptibility to blast fungus, probably resulting from the repression of ROS production and/or the involvement of OsCPK12 in the ABA signaling pathway.

Despite intense study, the biology of plant tissue invasion during blast disease remains poorly understood. Here we report a high-resolution transcriptional profiling study of the entire plant-associated development of the blast fungus. Our analysis revealed major temporal changes in fungal gene expression during plant infection. Pathogen gene expression could be classified into 10 modules of temporally co-expressed genes, providing evidence for the induction of pronounced shifts in primary and secondary metabolism, cell signaling, and transcriptional regulation. A set of 863 genes encoding secreted proteins are differentially expressed at specific stages of infection, and 546 genes named MEP (Magnaportheeffector protein) genes were predicted to encode effectors. Computational prediction of structurally related MEPs, including the MAX effector family, revealed their temporal co-regulation in the same co-expression modules. We characterized 32 MEP genes and demonstrate that Mep effectors are predominantly targeted to the cytoplasm of rice cells via the biotrophic interfacial complex and use a common unconventional secretory pathway.

In this study, we identified 15 genes belonging to the five C<sub>4</sub> gene families in rice genome through BLAST search using known maize C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway genes. Phylogenetic relationship of rice C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway genes and their isoforms with other grass genomes (Brachypodium, maize, Sorghum and Setaria), showed that these genes were highly conserved across grass genomes. Spatiotemporal, hormone, and abiotic stress specific expression pattern of the identified genes revealed constitutive as well as inductive responses of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway in different tissues and developmental stages of rice.

By comparative sequence analysis of plant-pathogenic fungi and Magnaporthe oryzae, we identified the small secreted C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger protein MoHTR3. MoHTR3 exhibited high conservation in M. oryzae strains but low conservation among other plant-pathogenic fungi, suggesting an emerging evolutionary selection process. MoHTR3 is exclusively expressed in the biotrophic stage of fungal invasion, and the encoded protein localizes to the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) and the host cell nucleus. The signal peptide crucial for MoHTR3' secretion to the BIC and the protein section required for its translocation to the nucleus were both identified by a functional protein domain study. The host-nuclear localization of MoHTR3 suggests a function as a transcriptional modulator of host defence gene induction. After ΔMohtr3 infection, the expression of jasmonic acid- and ethylene-associated genes was diminished in rice, in contrast to when the MoHTR3-overexpressing strain (MoHTR3ox) was applied. The transcript levels of salicylic acid- and defence-related genes were also affected after ΔMohtr3 and MoHTR3ox application. In pathogenicity assays, ΔMohtr3 was indistinguishable from the wild type. However, MoHTR3ox-infected plants showed diminished lesion formation and hydrogen peroxide accumulation, accompanied by a decrease in susceptibility, suggesting that the MoHTR3-induced manipulation of host cells affects host-pathogen interaction. MoHTR3 emphasizes the role of the host nucleus as a critical target for the pathogen-driven manipulation of host defence mechanisms and underscores the ongoing evolution of rice blast's arms race.",fungal effector play pivotal role suppressing host defence system evolution highly dynamic comparative sequence analysis plantpathogenic fungi magnaporthe oryzae identified small secreted csubsub hsubsub zinc finger protein mohtr mohtr exhibited high conservation oryzae strain low conservation among plantpathogenic fungi suggesting emerging evolutionary selection process mohtr exclusively expressed biotrophic stage fungal invasion encoded protein localizes biotrophic interfacial complex bic host cell nucleus signal peptide crucial mohtr secretion bic protein section required translocation nucleus identified functional protein domain study hostnuclear localization mohtr suggests function transcriptional modulator host defence gene induction δmohtr infection expression jasmonic acid ethyleneassociated gene diminished rice contrast mohtroverexpressing strain mohtrox applied transcript level salicylic acid defencerelated gene also affected δmohtr mohtrox application pathogenicity assay δmohtr indistinguishable wild type however mohtroxinfected plant showed diminished lesion formation hydrogen peroxide accumulation accompanied decrease susceptibility suggesting mohtrinduced manipulation host cell affect hostpathogen interaction mohtr emphasizes role host nucleus critical target pathogendriven manipulation host defence mechanism underscore ongoing evolution rice blast arm race,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['fungal effector']}",8

The filamentous fungus Magnaporthe grisea can cause disease on many species of the grass (Poaceae) family. The disease on rice, Rice Blast, is of enormous economic importance and biological interest. The mechanism used by this pathogen for breaching the formidable host surface barriers has been studied cytologically and genetically as a model for plant pathology, and represents a remarkably sophisticated achievement of nature. The single-celled appressorium of M. grisea acts as a vessel for the generation and application of perhaps the highest turgor pressures known.

23902261,"PAF104, a synthetic peptide to control rice blast disease by blocking appressorium formation in Magnaporthe oryzae.","Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating pathogen of rice and the main cause of crop losses worldwide. The successful management of blast disease caused by this fungus is a clear necessity. The synthetic peptide PAF104 has been characterized by its inhibition of M. oryzae appressorium formation on hydrophobic surfaces. Growth and the ability of conidia to germinate was not affected by PAF104, indicating the lack of toxicity on fungal conidia. The addition of the cutin monomer 1,16-hexadecanediol does not interfere with the inhibitory effect of PAF104 on in vitro hydrophobic surfaces. On the other hand, inhibition of appressorium formation by PAF104 was nullified by the exogenous addition of cAMP. Our results suggest that PAF104 affects the Pmk1 pathway by repression of the gene expression of MoMSB2, which encodes a sensing surface protein, and the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase MST11. The pathogenicity of M. oryzae was reduced after PAF104 treatment specifically blocking appressorium formation.

17498622,Genome-wide detection and analysis of alternative splicing for nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeats sequences in rice.,"Alternative splicing is a major contributor to genomic complexity and proteome diversity, yet the analysis of alternative splicing for the sequence containing nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR) domain has not been explored in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Hidden Markov model (HMM) searches were performed for NBS-LRR domain. 875 NBS-LRR-encoding sequences were obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). All of them were used to blast Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular Biological Encyclopaedia (KOME), TIGR rice gene index (TGI), and Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) to obtain homologous full-length cDNAs (FL-cDNAs), tentative consensus sequences, and protein sequences. Alternative splicing events were detected from genomic alignment of FL-cDNAs, tentative consensus sequences, and protein sequences, which provide valuable information on splice variants of genes. These sequences were aligned to the corresponding BAC sequences using the Spidey and Sim4 programs and each of the proteins was aligned by tBLASTn. Of the 875 NBS-LRR sequences, 119 (13.6%) sequences had alternative splicing where multiple FL-cDNAs, TGI sequences and proteins corresponded to the same gene. 71 intron retention events, 20 exon skipping events, 16 alternative termination events, 25 alternative initiation events, 12 alternative 5' splicing events, and 16 alternative 3' splicing events were identified. Most of these alternative splices were supported by two or more transcripts. The data sets are available at http://www.bioinfor.org Furthermore, the bioinformatics analysis of splice boundaries showed that exon skipping and intron retention did not exhibit strong consensus. This implies a different regulation mechanism that guides the expression of splice isoforms. This article also presents the analysis of the effects of intron retention on proteins. The C-terminal regions of alternative proteins turned out to be more variable than the N-terminal regions. Finally, tissue distribution and protein localization of alternative splicing were explored. The largest categories of tissue distributions for alternative splicing were shoot and callus. More than one-thirds of protein localization for splice forms was plasma membrane and cytoplasm.

Vertical resistance to blast disease is widely studied despite its instability. Clusters of genes or QTLs conferring blast resistance that offer durable horizontal resistance are important in resistance breeding. In this study, we aimed to refine the reported QTLs and identify stable meta-QTLs (MQTLs) associated with rice blast resistance. A total of 435 QTLs were used to project 71 MQTLs across all the rice chromosomes. As many as 199 putative rice blast resistance genes were identified within 53 MQTL regions. The genes included 48 characterized resistance gene analogs and related proteins, such as NBS-LRR type, LRR receptor-like kinase, NB-ARC domain, pathogenesis-related TF/ERF domain, elicitor-induced defense and proteins involved in defense signaling. MQTL regions with clusters of RGA were also identified. Fifteen highly significant MQTLs included 29 candidate genes and genes characterized for blast resistance, such as Piz, Nbs-Pi9, pi55-1, pi55-2, Pi3/Pi5-1, Pi3/Pi5-2, Pikh, Pi54, Pik/Pikm/Pikp, Pb1 and Pb2. Furthermore, the candidate genes (42) were associated with differential expression (in silico) in compatible and incompatible reactions upon disease infection. Moreover, nearly half of the genes within the MQTL regions were orthologous to those in O. sativa indica, Z. mays and A. thaliana, which confirmed their significance. The peak markers within three significant MQTLs differentiated blast-resistant and susceptible lines and serve as potential surrogates for the selection of blast-resistant lines.

33275098,A self-balancing circuit centered on MoOsm1 kinase governs adaptive responses to host-derived ROS in <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.,"The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a ubiquitous defense response in plants. Adapted pathogens evolved mechanisms to counteract the deleterious effects of host-derived ROS and promote infection. How plant pathogens regulate this elaborate response against ROS burst remains unclear. Using the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, we uncovered a self-balancing circuit controlling response to ROS in planta and virulence. During infection, ROS induces phosphorylation of the high osmolarity glycerol pathway kinase MoOsm1 and its nuclear translocation. There, MoOsm1 phosphorylates transcription factor MoAtf1 and dissociates MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex. This releases MoTup1-mediated transcriptional repression on oxidoreduction-pathway genes and activates the transcription of MoPtp1/2 protein phosphatases. In turn, MoPtp1/2 dephosphorylate MoOsm1, restoring the circuit to its initial state. Balanced interactions among proteins centered on MoOsm1 provide a means to counter host-derived ROS. Our findings thereby reveal new insights into how <i>M. oryzae</i> utilizes a phosphor-regulatory circuitry to face plant immunity during infection.",production reactive oxygen specie ro ubiquitous defense response plant adapted pathogen evolved mechanism counteract deleterious effect hostderived ro promote infection plant pathogen regulate elaborate response ro burst remains unclear using rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei uncovered selfbalancing circuit controlling response ro planta virulence infection ro induces phosphorylation high osmolarity glycerol pathway kinase moosm nuclear translocation moosm phosphorylates transcription factor moatf dissociates moatfmotup complex release motupmediated transcriptional repression oxidoreductionpathway gene activates transcription moptp protein phosphatase turn moptp dephosphorylate moosm restoring circuit initial state balanced interaction among protein centered moosm provide mean counter hostderived ro finding thereby reveal new insight im oryzaei utilizes phosphorregulatory circuitry face plant immunity infection,0,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei uncovered selfbalancing circuit controlling response'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['mechanism counteract deleterious effect']}",8

The activities of hydroperoxidelyase and antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase) were increased and high levels of aldehydes including malondialdehyde were produced. The constitutive level of jasmonic was slightly increased and the constitutive salicylic acid level was decreased. Kinetic analysis of wound response indicated that the levels of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are inversely correlated in nully transgenic rice plants, suggesting that there is an antagonistic interaction between jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Microarray analysis indicated that several defense-related genes encoding antioxidative enzymes and pathogen-related proteins were up-regulated, and the resistance to rice blast fungus was enhanced in transgenic rice. Taken together, our results suggest that maize lipoxygenase-1 expressed in the cytoplasm plays an important role for the regulation of defense system including the antioxidative enzymes in transgenic rice, and that these effects may be mediated by reactive oxygen species generated through the enzyme-initiated catalytic peroxidation mechanism of maize lipoxygenase-1.",effect transgenic expression dual positional maize lipoxygenase defense system analyzed rice activity hydroperoxidelyase antioxidative enzyme superoxide dismutase catalase peroxidase increased high level aldehyde including malondialdehyde produced constitutive level jasmonic slightly increased constitutive salicylic acid level decreased kinetic analysis wound response indicated level jasmonic acid salicylic acid inversely correlated nully transgenic rice plant suggesting antagonistic interaction jasmonic acid salicylic acid microarray analysis indicated several defenserelated gene encoding antioxidative enzyme pathogenrelated protein upregulated resistance rice blast fungus enhanced transgenic rice taken together result suggest maize lipoxygenase expressed cytoplasm play important role regulation defense system including antioxidative enzyme transgenic rice effect may mediated reactive oxygen specie generated enzymeinitiated catalytic peroxidation mechanism maize lipoxygenase,4,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['antioxidative enzyme transgenic rice effect']}",7

To explore the mechanisms underlying gene expression induced in rice by stresses, studies involving transcriptome analyses have been conducted over the past few years. Thus, it is crucial to have a reliable set of reference genes to normalize the expression levels of rice genes affected by different stresses. To identify potential reference genes for studies of the differential expression of target genes in rice under M. oryzae infection and drought conditions, the present study evaluated five housekeeping genes for the normalization of gene expression. The stability of the expression of these genes was assessed using the analytical software packages geNorm and NormFinder. For all samples analyzed, the stability rank was UBQ5 > GAPDH > eIF-4α> β-TUB > 18S rRNA.

This requires the existence of colinearity between the Arabidopsis and cereal genomes, represented by rice, which is readily detectable using currently available resources, that is, Arabidopsis genomic sequence, rice ESTs, and genetic and physical maps. A detailed study of the colinearity remaining between two small regions of Arabidopsis chromosome 1 and rice suggests that at least in these regions of the Arabidopsis genome, conservation of gene orders with rice has been eroded to the point that it is no longer identifiable using comparative mapping. Although our analysis does not preclude that tracts of colinear gene orders may be identified using sequence comparisons or may exist in other regions of the rice and Arabidopsis genomes, it is unlikely that the extent of colinearity will be sufficient to allow map-based cross-species gene prediction and isolation.

Therefore, revealing the functions and mechanism of PE biosynthesis in plant pathogens would provide potential targets for crop disease control. We performed analyses including phenotypic characterizations, lipidomics, enzyme activity, site-directed mutagenesis, and chemical inhibition assays to study the function of PS decarboxylase-encoding gene MoPSD2 in rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.

Furthermore, chemical doxorubicin inhibited the enzyme activity of MoPsd2 and showed antifungal activity against 10 phytopathogenic fungi including M. oryzae and reduced disease severity of two crop diseases in the field. Three predicted doxorubicin-interacting residues are important for MoPsd2 functions.

Spl18 was dominant and its phenotype was linked to the T-DNA insertion. An ORF was located about 500 bp downstream of the inserted T-DNA, and the deduced protein, designated OsAT1, showed sequence similarity to an acyltransferase whose expression is induced by hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. The transcriptional level of OsAT1 was very low in the WT leaf blade but high in Spl18 leaf blade. In wild-type rice, OsAT1 was transcribed mainly in the young panicle, in the panicle just after heading, and in the leaf sheath. In addition, transcription of the genes for PR protein was upregulated in Spl18, accumulation of phytoalexins (both momilactone A and sakuranetin) was increased, and resistance to blast disease was improved.

20739304,AGC kinase OsOxi1 positively regulates basal resistance through suppression of OsPti1a-mediated negative regulation.,"OsPti1a, a functional ortholog of tomato SlPti1, negatively regulates both basal resistance and R-gene-mediated resistance in rice. To investigate the molecular function of OsPti1a in defense responses, we searched for components interacting with OsPti1a using a yeast two-hybrid system. One of the interacting proteins is a Ser/Thr kinase that directly phosphorylates OsPti1a in vitro. This protein belongs to the AGC kinase family and is highly similar to AtOxi1, which is induced in response to a wide range of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating stimuli in Arabidopsis. Thus, it was designated OsOxi1. OsOxi1 was transiently phosphorylated in response to ROS and chitin elicitor. Both OsOxi1-overexpressing transgenic lines and the ospti1a mutant were highly sensitive to ROS treatment, indicating that OsOxi1 and OsPti1a are involved in ROS-mediated signaling in opposing ways. OsOxi1 is specifically expressed at infection sites where ROS are produced after inoculation with a blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae. Overexpression of OsOxi1 enhanced basal resistance to the blast fungus, indicating that OsOxi1 positively regulates disease resistance. OsOxi1 phosphorylates Thr-233 of OsPti1a and a point mutation of Thr-233 enhanced disease susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), suggesting that the phosphorylation of OsPti1a by OsOxi1 is essential for basal resistance to Xoo.

33892515,Rice contains a biosynthetic gene cluster associated with production of the casbane-type diterpenoid phytoalexin ent-10-oxodepressin.,"Diterpenoids play important roles in rice microbial disease resistance as phytoalexins, as well as acting in allelopathy and abiotic stress responses. Recently, the casbane-type phytoalexin ent-10-oxodepressin was identified in rice, but its biosynthesis has not yet been elucidated. Here ent-10-oxodepressin biosynthesis was investigated via co-expression analysis and biochemical characterisation, with use of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for genetic analysis. The results identified a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) on rice chromosome 7 (c7BGC), containing the relevant ent-casbene synthase (OsECBS), and four cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes from the CYP71Z subfamily. Three of these CYPs were shown to act on ent-casbene, with CYP71Z2 able to produce a keto group at carbon-5 (C5), while the closely related paralogues CYP71Z21 and CYP71Z22 both readily produce a keto group at C10. Together these C5 and C10 oxidases can elaborate ent-casbene to ent-10-oxodepressin (5,10-diketo-ent-casbene). OsECBS knockout lines no longer produce casbane-type diterpenoids and exhibit impaired resistance to the rice fungal blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Elucidation of ent-10-oxodepressin biosynthesis and the associated c7BGC provides not only a potential target for molecular breeding, but also, gives the intriguing parallels to the independently assembled BGCs for casbene-derived diterpenoids in the Euphorbiaceae, further insight into plant BGC evolution, as discussed here.",diterpenoids play important role rice microbial disease resistance phytoalexins well acting allelopathy abiotic stress response recently casbanetype phytoalexin entoxodepressin identified rice biosynthesis yet elucidated entoxodepressin biosynthesis investigated via coexpression analysis biochemical characterisation use crisprcas technology genetic analysis result identified biosynthetic gene cluster bgc rice chromosome cbgc containing relevant entcasbene synthase osecbs four cytochrome p cyp gene cypz subfamily three cyps shown act entcasbene cypz able produce keto group carbon c closely related paralogues cypz cypz readily produce keto group c together c c oxidase elaborate entcasbene entoxodepressin diketoentcasbene osecbs knockout line longer produce casbanetype diterpenoids exhibit impaired resistance rice fungal blast pathogen magnaporthe oryzae elucidation entoxodepressin biosynthesis associated cbgc provides potential target molecular breeding also give intriguing parallel independently assembled bgcs casbenederived diterpenoids euphorbiaceae insight plant bgc evolution discussed,8,"{'Disease': ['important role rice microbial disease resistance'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8
16183700,The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development.,"That plant dwarfism is caused by hormonal defects related to gibberellin and brassinosteroid has been well documented. Other contributing elements, however, have not been elucidated. Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1). Most mutant plants died within 1 month after sowing, but a few (5.2%) survived and grew. Vacuolation enlarged cells in the leaf primordia and seminal root before abortion, which disrupted the organized cell files in these organs. Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal. Similarly, initiation and organogenesis of the leaf primordia at the shoot apical meristem and those of the lateral root primordia at the root elongation zone occurred normally. These observations suggest that DBS1 is involved in the growth and development of organs but not in organ initiation or organogenesis. Positional cloning of DBS1 revealed that it encoded a NACK-type kinesin-like protein (OsNACK), homologous to the essential components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade during plant cytokinesis. A BLAST search indicated that DBS1 was the only gene encoding the OsNACK-type protein in the rice genome, and the dbs1 mutant produced only small amounts of the translatable DBS1 mRNA. Thus, we conclude that the dbs1 mutation causes a severe defect in DBS1 function but does not completely shut it down. We discuss the leaky phenotype of dbs1 under the restricted functioning of OsNACK.",plant dwarfism caused hormonal defect related gibberellin brassinosteroid well documented contributing element however elucidated report one severe dwarf mutant rice dwarf bamboo shoot db mutant plant died within month sowing survived grew vacuolation enlarged cell leaf primordium seminal root abortion disrupted organized cell file organ relative severe defect shoot root growth overall structure db embryo almost normal similarly initiation organogenesis leaf primordium shoot apical meristem lateral root primordium root elongation zone occurred normally observation suggest db involved growth development organ organ initiation organogenesis positional cloning db revealed encoded nacktype kinesinlike protein osnack homologous essential component mitogenactivated protein kinase cascade plant cytokinesis blast search indicated db gene encoding osnacktype protein rice genome db mutant produced small amount translatable db mrna thus conclude db mutation cause severe defect db function completely shut discus leaky phenotype db restricted functioning osnack,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",3
36101507,Osa-miR160a confers broad-spectrum resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in rice.,"Rice production is threatened by multiple pathogens. Breeding cultivars with broad-spectrum disease resistance is necessary to maintain and improve crop production. Previously we found that overexpression of miR160a enhanced rice blast disease resistance. However, it is unclear whether miR160a also regulates resistance against other pathogens, and what the downstream signaling pathways are. Here, we demonstrate that miR160a positively regulates broad-spectrum resistance against the causative agents of blast, leaf blight and sheath blight in rice. Mutations of miR160a-targeted Auxin Response Factors result in different alteration of resistance conferred by miR160a. miR160a enhances disease resistance partially by suppressing ARF8, as mutation of ARF8 in MIM160 background partially restores the compromised resistance resulting from MIM160. ARF8 protein binds directly to the promoter and suppresses the expression of WRKY45, which acts as a positive regulator of rice immunity. Mutation of WRKY45 compromises the enhanced blast resistance and bacterial leaf blight resistance conferred by arf8 mutant. Overall, our results reveal that a microRNA coordinates rice broad-spectrum disease resistance by suppressing multiple target genes that play different roles in disease resistance, and uncover a new regulatory pathway mediated by the miR160a-ARF8 module. These findings provide new resources to potentially improve disease resistance for breeding in rice.",rice production threatened multiple pathogen breeding cultivar broadspectrum disease resistance necessary maintain improve crop production previously found overexpression mira enhanced rice blast disease resistance however unclear whether mira also regulates resistance pathogen downstream signaling pathway demonstrate mira positively regulates broadspectrum resistance causative agent blast leaf blight sheath blight rice mutation miratargeted auxin response factor result different alteration resistance conferred mira mira enhances disease resistance partially suppressing arf mutation arf mim background partially restores compromised resistance resulting mim arf protein bind directly promoter suppresses expression wrky act positive regulator rice immunity mutation wrky compromise enhanced blast resistance bacterial leaf blight resistance conferred arf mutant overall result reveal microrna coordinate rice broadspectrum disease resistance suppressing multiple target gene play different role disease resistance uncover new regulatory pathway mediated miraarf module finding provide new resource potentially improve disease resistance breeding rice,8,"{'Disease': ['multiple pathogen breeding cultivar broadspectrum disease resistance', 'overexpression mira enhanced rice blast disease resistance', 'disease resistance', 'microrna coordinate rice broadspectrum disease resistance', 'different role disease resistance', 'disease resistance breeding rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10
22539438,Secretome analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae using in vitro systems.,"Magnaporthe oryzae is a devastating blast fungal pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa L.) that causes dramatic decreases in seed yield and quality. During the early stages of infection by this pathogen, the fungal spore senses the rice leaf surface, germinates, and penetrates the cell via an infectious structure known as an appressorium. During this process, M. oryzae secretes several proteins; however, these proteins are largely unknown mainly due to the lack of a suitable method for isolating secreted proteins during germination and appressoria formation. We examined the secretome of M. oryzae by mimicking the early stages of infection in vitro using a glass plate (GP), PVDF membrane, and liquid culture medium (LCM). Microscopic observation of M. oryzae growth revealed appressorium formation on the GP and PVDF membrane resembling natural M. oryzae-rice interactions; however, appresorium formation was not observed in the LCM. Secreted proteins were collected from the GP (3, 8, and 24 h), PVDF membrane (24 h), and LCM (48 h) and identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The GP, PVDF membrane, and LCM-derived 2D gels showed distinct protein patterns, indicating that they are complementary approaches. Collectively, 53 nonredundant proteins including previously known and novel secreted proteins were identified. Six biological functions were assigned to the proteins, with the predominant functional classes being cell wall modification, reactive oxygen species detoxification, lipid modification, metabolism, and protein modification. The in vitro system using GPs and PVDF membranes applied in this study to survey the M. oryzae secretome, can be used to further our understanding of the early interactions between M. oryzae and rice leaves.",magnaporthe oryzae devastating blast fungal pathogen rice oryza sativa l cause dramatic decrease seed yield quality early stage infection pathogen fungal spore sens rice leaf surface germinates penetrates cell via infectious structure known appressorium process oryzae secretes several protein however protein largely unknown mainly due lack suitable method isolating secreted protein germination appressoria formation examined secretome oryzae mimicking early stage infection vitro using glass plate gp pvdf membrane liquid culture medium lcm microscopic observation oryzae growth revealed appressorium formation gp pvdf membrane resembling natural oryzaerice interaction however appresorium formation observed lcm secreted protein collected gp h pvdf membrane h lcm h identified twodimensional gel electrophoresis de followed tandem mass spectrometry gp pvdf membrane lcmderived gel showed distinct protein pattern indicating complementary approach collectively nonredundant protein including previously known novel secreted protein identified six biological function assigned protein predominant functional class cell wall modification reactive oxygen specie detoxification lipid modification metabolism protein modification vitro system using gps pvdf membrane applied study survey oryzae secretome used understanding early interaction oryzae rice leaf,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': ['suitable method'], 'Symptom': []}",2

19153255,Rice Pi5-mediated resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae requires the presence of two coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding-leucine-rich repeat genes.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases of rice. To understand the molecular basis of Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae, we cloned the resistance (R) gene at this locus using a map-based cloning strategy. Genetic and phenotypic analyses of 2014 F2 progeny from a mapping population derived from a cross between IR50, a susceptible rice cultivar, and the RIL260 line carrying Pi5 enabled us to narrow down the Pi5 locus to a 130-kb interval. Sequence analysis of this genomic region identified two candidate genes, Pi5-1 and Pi5-2, which encode proteins carrying three motifs characteristic of R genes: an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) motif, a nucleotide-binding (NB) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. In genetic transformation experiments of a susceptible rice cultivar, neither the Pi5-1 nor the Pi5-2 gene was found to confer resistance to M. oryzae. In contrast, transgenic rice plants expressing both of these genes, generated by crossing transgenic lines carrying each gene individually, conferred Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae. Gene expression analysis revealed that Pi5-1 transcripts accumulate after pathogen challenge, whereas the Pi5-2 gene is constitutively expressed. These results indicate that the presence of these two genes is required for rice Pi5-mediated resistance to M. oryzae.",rice blast caused fungus magnaporthe oryzae one devastating disease rice understand molecular basis pimediated resistance oryzae cloned resistance r gene locus using mapbased cloning strategy genetic phenotypic analysis f progeny mapping population derived cross ir susceptible rice cultivar ril line carrying pi enabled u narrow pi locus kb interval sequence analysis genomic region identified two candidate gene pi pi encode protein carrying three motif characteristic r gene nterminal coiledcoil cc motif nucleotidebinding nb domain leucinerich repeat lrr motif genetic transformation experiment susceptible rice cultivar neither pi pi gene found confer resistance oryzae contrast transgenic rice plant expressing gene generated crossing transgenic line carrying gene individually conferred pimediated resistance oryzae gene expression analysis revealed pi transcript accumulate pathogen challenge whereas pi gene constitutively expressed result indicate presence two gene required rice pimediated resistance oryzae,10,"{'Disease': ['fungus magnaporthe', 'one devastating disease rice'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5

In laboratory incubations, CH(4) production rates from anoxic soil slurries were significantly reduced at amendment levels of 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 5% (wt wt(-1)), while observed CO(2) production rates were enhanced. The level of suppression in methane production was the highest for phosphogypsum, followed by blast slag and then fly ash. In the greenhouse experiment, CH(4) emission rates from the rice planted potted soils significantly decreased with the increasing levels (2-20 Mg ha(-1)) of the selected amendments applied, while rice yield simultaneously increased compared to the control treatment. At 10 Mg ha(-1) application level of the amendments, total seasonal CH(4) emissions were reduced by 20%, 27% and 25%, while rice grain yields were increased by 17%, 15% and 23% over the control with fly ash, phosphogypsum, and blast slag amendments, respectively. The suppression of CH(4) production rates as well as total seasonal CH(4) flux could be due to the increased concentrations of active iron, free iron, manganese oxides, and sulfate in the amended soil, which acted as electron acceptors and controlled methanogens' activity by limiting substrates availability. Among the amendments, blast furnace slag and fly ash contributed mainly to improve the soil nutrients balance and increased the soil pH level towards neutral point, but soil acidity was developed with phosphogypsum application.

28663588,The Nep1-like protein family of Magnaporthe oryzae is dispensable for the infection of rice plants.,"The necrosis- and ethylene-inducing protein 1 (Nep1)-like proteins (NLPs) are a class of microbe-associated molecular patterns widely distributed across diverse groups of plant-associated microorganisms. In spite of the cytotoxic activity in dicot plants, the role of most NLPs in the virulence of plant pathogens is still largely unknown. We showed that the MoNLP family of rice blast fungus varied very little in amino acid sequence, transient expression of three MoNLPs induced cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species in Nicotiana benthamiana, and the expression of MoNLPs was induced during infection of susceptible rice plants. To further investigate the biological role of the MoNLP family, a marker-free gene replacement vector was developed and used to knock out the whole family in Magnaporthe oryzae. Results showed no significant difference in disease levels caused by wild type and the quadruple ΔMoNLP mutant strains. Likewise, the sporulation and radial growth of the two strains were similar under various unfavorable cultural conditions including malnutrition and abiotic stresses.

23627500,Identification of a novel microRNA (miRNA) from rice that targets an alternatively spliced transcript of the Nramp6 (Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 6) gene involved in pathogen resistance.,"Plants have evolved efficient defence mechanisms to defend themselves from pathogen attack. Although many studies have focused on the transcriptional regulation of defence responses, less is known about the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in plant immunity. This work investigates miRNAs that are regulated by elicitors from the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice (Oryza sativa). Small RNA libraries were constructed from rice tissues and subjected to high-throughput sequencing for the identification of elicitor-responsive miRNAs. Target gene expression was examined by microarray analysis. Transgenic lines were used for the analysis of miRNA functioning in disease resistance. Elicitor treatment is accompanied by dynamic alterations in the expression of a significant number of miRNAs, including new members of annotated miRNAs. Novel miRNAs from rice are proposed.

38451992,Rice-Magnaporthe oryzae interactions in resistant and susceptible rice cultivars under panicle blast infection based on defense-related enzyme activities and metabolomics.,"Rice blast, caused by rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), is a global threat to food security, with up to 50% yield losses. Panicle blast is a severe form of rice blast, and disease responses vary between cultivars with different genotypes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated signaling reactions and the phenylpropanoid pathway are important defense mechanisms involved in recognizing and resisting against fungal infection. To understand rice-M. oryzae interactions in resistant and susceptible cultivars, we determined dynamic changes in the activities of five defense-related enzymes in resistant cultivar jingsui 18 and susceptible cultivar jinyuan 899 infected with M. oryzae from 4 to 25 days after infection. We then performed untargeted metabolomics analyses to profile the metabolomes of the cultivars under infected and non-infected conditions. Dynamic changes in the activities of five defense-related enzymes were closely related to panicle blast resistance in rice. Metabolome data analysis identified 634 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) between resistant and susceptible cultivars following infection, potentially explaining differences in disease response between varieties. The most enriched DAMs were associated with lipids and lipid-like molecules, phenylpropanoids and polyketides, organoheterocyclic compounds, organic acids and derivatives, and lignans, neolignans, and related compounds. Multiple metabolic pathways are involved in resistance to panicle blast in rice, including biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, lysine biosynthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation.",rice blast caused rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae global threat food security yield loss panicle blast severe form rice blast disease response vary cultivar different genotype reactive oxygen specie rosmediated signaling reaction phenylpropanoid pathway important defense mechanism involved recognizing resisting fungal infection understand ricem oryzae interaction resistant susceptible cultivar determined dynamic change activity five defenserelated enzyme resistant cultivar jingsui susceptible cultivar jinyuan infected oryzae day infection performed untargeted metabolomics analysis profile metabolomes cultivar infected noninfected condition dynamic change activity five defenserelated enzyme closely related panicle blast resistance rice metabolome data analysis identified differentially accumulated metabolite dam resistant susceptible cultivar following infection potentially explaining difference disease response variety enriched dam associated lipid lipidlike molecule phenylpropanoids polyketides organoheterocyclic compound organic acid derivative lignans neolignans related compound multiple metabolic pathway involved resistance panicle blast rice including biosynthesis secondary metabolite amino acid metabolism lipid metabolism phenylpropanoid biosynthesis arachidonic acid metabolism arginine biosynthesis tyrosine metabolism tryptophan metabolism tyrosine tryptophan biosynthesis lysine biosynthesis oxidative phosphorylation,4,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae global threat food security yield loss panicle blast severe form rice blast disease response', 'difference disease response variety enriched dam associated lipid'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",8

To investigate the functional roles of MSP1 and its downstream signaling in rice, recombinant MSP1 was produced in Escherichia coli and was assayed for its functionality. Application of MSP1 triggered cell death and elicited defense responses in rice. MSP1 also induced H2O2 production and autophagic cell death in both suspension-cultured cells and rice leaves. One or more protein kinases triggered cell death, jasmonic acid and abscisic acid enhanced cell death, while salicylic acid suppressed it. We demonstrated that the secretion of MSP1 into the apoplast is a prerequisite for triggering cell death and activating defense-related gene expression. Furthermore, pretreatment of rice with a sublethal MSP1 concentration potentiated resistance to the pathogen. Taken together, our results showed that MSP1 induces a high degree of cell death in plants, which might be essential for its virulence.

29663402,Global analysis of sumoylation function reveals novel insights into development and appressorium-mediated infection of the rice blast fungus.,"Protein post-translational modifications play critical roles in cellular processes, development and stress response. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to proteins is one of the essential modifications in eukaryotes, but its function remains largely unknown in plant pathogenic fungi. We present a comprehensive analysis combined with proteomic, molecular and cellular approaches to explore the roles of sumoylation in the model plant fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. We found the SUMO pathway plays key roles in colony growth, conidia formation and virulence to the host, as well as cell-cycle-related phenotypes. Sumoylation is also involved in responding to different stresses. Affinity purification identified 940 putative SUMO substrates, many of which were reported to be involved in development, stress response and infection. Interestingly, four septins were also shown to be sumoylated. Mutation of consensus sumoylation sites in each septin all resulted in reduced virulence to the host and dislocation of septins in appressoria. Moreover, sumoylation is also involved in extracellular secretion of different effector proteins. Our study on the functions of sumoylation provides novel insight into development and infection of the rice blast fungus.",protein posttranslational modification play critical role cellular process development stress response small ubiquitinlike modifier sumo protein one essential modification eukaryote function remains largely unknown plant pathogenic fungi present comprehensive analysis combined proteomic molecular cellular approach explore role sumoylation model plant fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae found sumo pathway play key role colony growth conidium formation virulence host well cellcyclerelated phenotype sumoylation also involved responding different stress affinity purification identified putative sumo substrate many reported involved development stress response infection interestingly four septins also shown sumoylated mutation consensus sumoylation site septin resulted reduced virulence host dislocation septins appressoria moreover sumoylation also involved extracellular secretion different effector protein study function sumoylation provides novel insight development infection rice blast fungus,6,"{'Disease': ['novel insight development infection rice blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['extracellular secretion different effector protein study function sumoylation']}",7
27289079,Ectopic activation of the rice NLR heteropair RGA4/RGA5 confers resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak diseases.,"Bacterial blight (BB) and bacterial leaf streak (BLS) are important diseases in Oryza sativa caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), respectively. In both bacteria, transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are major virulence determinants that act by transactivating host genes downstream of effector-binding elements (EBEs) bound in a sequence-specific manner. Resistance to Xoo is mostly related to the action of TAL effectors, either by polymorphisms that prevent the induction of susceptibility (S) genes or by executor (R) genes with EBEs embedded in their promoter, and that induce cell death and resistance. For Xoc, no resistance sources are known in rice. Here, we investigated whether the recognition of effectors by nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat domain immune receptors (NLRs), the most widespread resistance mechanism in plants, is also able to stop BB and BLS. In one instance, transgenic rice lines harboring the AVR1-CO39 effector gene from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, under the control of an inducible promoter, were challenged with transgenic Xoo and Xoc strains carrying a TAL effector designed to transactivate the inducible promoter. This induced AVR1-CO39 expression and triggered BB and BLS resistance when the corresponding Pi-CO39 resistance locus was present. In a second example, the transactivation of an auto-active NLR by Xoo-delivered designer TAL effectors resulted in BB resistance, demonstrating that NLR-triggered immune responses efficiently control Xoo. This forms the foundation for future BB and BLS disease control strategies, whereupon endogenous TAL effectors will target synthetic promoter regions of Avr or NLR executor genes.",bacterial blight bb bacterial leaf streak bls important disease oryza sativa caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola xoc respectively bacteria transcription activatorlike tal effector major virulence determinant act transactivating host gene downstream effectorbinding element ebes bound sequencespecific manner resistance xoo mostly related action tal effector either polymorphism prevent induction susceptibility gene executor r gene ebes embedded promoter induce cell death resistance xoc resistance source known rice investigated whether recognition effector nucleotide binding leucinerich repeat domain immune receptor nlrs widespread resistance mechanism plant also able stop bb bls one instance transgenic rice line harboring avrco effector gene rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae control inducible promoter challenged transgenic xoo xoc strain carrying tal effector designed transactivate inducible promoter induced avrco expression triggered bb bls resistance corresponding pico resistance locus present second example transactivation autoactive nlr xoodelivered designer tal effector resulted bb resistance demonstrating nlrtriggered immune response efficiently control xoo form foundation future bb bls disease control strategy whereupon endogenous tal effector target synthetic promoter region avr nlr executor gene,1,"{'Disease': ['bacterial blight bb bacterial leaf streak bls important disease oryza sativa', 'bb bls one instance transgenic rice line harboring avrco effector gene rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae control inducible promoter', 'bb bls disease control strategy whereupon endogenous tal effector target synthetic promoter region avr nlr executor gene'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['tal effector major virulence determinant act', 'mostly related action tal effector', 'recognition effector', 'bb bls one instance transgenic rice line harboring avrco effector gene rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae control inducible promoter', 'tal effector', 'bls resistance corresponding pico resistance locus present second example transactivation autoactive nlr xoodelivered designer tal effector', 'bb bls disease control strategy whereupon endogenous tal effector target synthetic promoter region avr nlr executor gene']}",0

In this work, we successfully transformed rice with the mohrip1 and mohrip2 genes separately. The MoHrip1 and MoHrip2 transgenic rice plants displayed higher resistance to rice blast and stronger tolerance to drought stress than wild-type (WT) rice and the vector-control pCXUN rice. The expression of salicylic acid (SA)- and abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes was also increased, suggesting that these two elicitors may trigger SA signaling to protect the rice from damage during pathogen infection and regulate the ABA content to increase drought tolerance in transgenic rice. Trypan blue staining indicated that expressing MoHrip1 and MoHrip2 in rice plants inhibited hyphal growth of the rice blast fungus. Relative water content (RWC), water usage efficiency (WUE) and water loss rate (WLR) were measured to confirm the high capacity for water retention in transgenic rice.

(Ufra.T06, Ufra.T09, Ufra.T12, and Ufra.T52) and characterize their interaction with Magnaporthe oryzae in vitro and in vivo conditions. The four isolates of Trichoderma sp. were sequenced, investigated as an antagonist against M. oryzae in five Petri plate assays, and as an inhibitor of conidial germination appressoria formation. Finally, were quantified the lytic activity of chitinase (CHI), glucanase (GLU), and protease (PRO) during co-cultivation of Trichoderma sp. and M. oryzae. In vivo, leaf blast suppression was evaluated in two assays: simultaneous and curative application. Both in vitro and in vivo assays were scanned by electron microscopy (SEM).

36539712,Jasmonic acid contributes to rice resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The annual yield losses caused by the Rice Blast Fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, range to the equivalent for feeding 60 million people. To ward off infection by this fungus, rice has evolved a generic basal immunity (so called compatible interaction), which acts in concert with strain-specific defence (so-called incompatible interaction). The plant-defence hormone jasmonic acid (JA) promotes the resistance to M. oryzae, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To get more insight into this open question, we employ the JA-deficient mutants, cpm2 and hebiba, and dissect the JA-dependent defence signalling in rice for both, compatible and incompatible interactions. We observe that both JA-deficient mutants are more susceptible to M. oryzae as compared to their wild-type background, which holds true for both types of interactions as verified by cytological staining. Secondly, we observe that transcripts for JA biosynthesis (OsAOS2 and OsOPR7), JA signalling (OsJAZ8, OsJAZ9, OsJAZ11 and OsJAZ13), JA-dependent phytoalexin synthesis (OsNOMT), and JA-regulated defence-related genes, such as OsBBTI2 and OsPR1a, accumulate after fungal infection in a pattern that correlates with the amplitude of resistance. Thirdly, induction of defence transcripts is weaker during compatible interaction.

25383752,Antimicrobial activity of UV-induced phenylamides from rice leaves.,"Rice produces a wide array of phytoalexins in response to pathogen attacks and UV-irradiation. Except for the flavonoid sakuranetin, most phytoalexins identified in rice are diterpenoid compounds. Analysis of phenolic-enriched fractions from UV-treated rice leaves showed that several phenolic compounds in addition to sakuranetin accumulated remarkably in rice leaves. We isolated two compounds from UV-treated rice leaves using silica gel column chromatography and preparative HPLC. The isolated phenolic compounds were identified as phenylamide compounds: N-trans-cinnamoyltryptamine and N-p-coumaroylserotonin. Expression analysis of biosynthetic genes demonstrated that genes for arylamine biosynthesis were upregulated by UV irradiation. This result suggested that phenylamide biosynthetic pathways are activated in rice leaves by UV treatment. To unravel the role of UV-induced phenylamides as phytoalexins, we examined their antimicrobial activity against rice fungal and bacterial pathogens. N-trans-Cinnamoyltryptamine inhibited the growth of rice brown spot fungus (Bipolaris oryzae). In addition to the known antifungal activity to the blast fungus, sakuranetin had antimicrobial activity toward B. oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani (rice sheath blight fungus). UV-induced phenylamides and sakuranetin also had antimicrobial activity against rice bacterial pathogens for grain rot (Burkholderia glumae), blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) and leaf streak (X. oryzae pv. oryzicola) diseases.

A protein of molecular mass 31 kDa was induced by a susceptible host extract, while the fungus exposed to extract from the resistant cultivar and the untreated samples did not show the presence of this protein. Levels of this 31 kDa protein increased 30-fold, 72 h after treatment with plant extracts, with the concomitant appearance of at least sixteen other novel proteins. Fungus treated with extracts of resistant host or the untreated samples did not show any of these proteins while the proteins specific to different growth stages appeared as expected. Analysis of the extracellular samples showed induction of a 17 kDa protein after 72 h in the culture treated with susceptible host extract.

31986137,Genome assembly and characterization of a complex zfBED-NLR gene-containing disease resistance locus in Carolina Gold Select rice with Nanopore sequencing.,"Long-read sequencing facilitates assembly of complex genomic regions. In plants, loci containing nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) disease resistance genes are an important example of such regions. NLR genes constitute one of the largest gene families in plants and are often clustered, evolving via duplication, contraction, and transposition. We recently mapped the Xo1 locus for resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak, found in the American heirloom rice variety Carolina Gold Select, to a region that in the Nipponbare reference genome is NLR gene-rich. Here, toward identification of the Xo1 gene, we combined Nanopore and Illumina reads and generated a high-quality Carolina Gold Select genome assembly. We identified 529 complete or partial NLR genes and discovered, relative to Nipponbare, an expansion of NLR genes at the Xo1 locus. One of these has high sequence similarity to the cloned, functionally similar Xa1 gene. Both harbor an integrated zfBED domain, and the repeats within each protein are nearly perfect. Across diverse Oryzeae, we identified two sub-clades of NLR genes with these features, varying in the presence of the zfBED domain and the number of repeats. The Carolina Gold Select genome assembly also uncovered at the Xo1 locus a rice blast resistance gene and a gene encoding a polyphenol oxidase (PPO). PPO activity has been used as a marker for blast resistance at the locus in some varieties; however, the Carolina Gold Select sequence revealed a loss-of-function mutation in the PPO gene that breaks this association. Our results demonstrate that whole genome sequencing combining Nanopore and Illumina reads effectively resolves NLR gene loci. Our identification of an Xo1 candidate is an important step toward mechanistic characterization, including the role(s) of the zfBED domain.

24140150,Two conidiation-related Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor genes in the rice blast fungus.,"Regulation of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs) helps plant pathogens to interact with the host plants and to sustain a pathogenic lifestyle in the environmental changes. Elucidating novel functions of TFs is, therefore, crucial for understanding pathogenesis mechanisms of plant pathogens. Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast pathogen, undergoes a series of developmental morphogenesis to complete its infection cycle. To understand TF genes implicated in pathogenic development of this fungus, two Zn(II)2Cys6 TF genes, MoCOD1 and MoCOD2, whose expression was notably induced during conidiation, were functionally characterized. Targeted deletion of MoCOD1 resulted in defects in conidiation and pathogenicity due to defects in appressorium formation and invasive growth within the host cells. MoCOD2 was also a critical regulator in conidiation and pathogenicity, but not in conidial germination and appressorium formation. When rice plants were inoculated with conidia of the ΔMocod2 mutant, rapid accumulation of dark brown granules was observed around the infection sites in the plant cells and no visible disease symptom was incited.

38289966,Autophagy and cell wall integrity pathways coordinately regulate the development and pathogenicity through MoAtg4 phosphorylation in Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Autophagy and Cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling are critical stress-responsive processes during fungal infection of host plants. In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, autophagy-related (ATG) proteins phosphorylate CWI kinases to regulate virulence; however, how autophagy interplays with CWI signaling to coordinate such regulation remains unknown. Here, we have identified the phosphorylation of ATG protein MoAtg4 as an important process in the coordination between autophagy and CWI in M. oryzae. The ATG kinase MoAtg1 phosphorylates MoAtg4 to inhibit the deconjugation and recycling of the key ATG protein MoAtg8. At the same time, MoMkk1, a core kinase of CWI, also phosphorylates MoAtg4 to attenuate the C-terminal cleavage of MoAtg8. Significantly, these two phosphorylation events maintain proper autophagy levels to coordinate the development and pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus.",autophagy cell wall integrity cwi signaling critical stressresponsive process fungal infection host plant rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae autophagyrelated atg protein phosphorylate cwi kinase regulate virulence however autophagy interplay cwi signaling coordinate regulation remains unknown identified phosphorylation atg protein moatg important process coordination autophagy cwi oryzae atg kinase moatg phosphorylates moatg inhibit deconjugation recycling key atg protein moatg time momkk core kinase cwi also phosphorylates moatg attenuate cterminal cleavage moatg significantly two phosphorylation event maintain proper autophagy level coordinate development pathogenicity rice blast fungus,3,"{'Disease': ['critical stressresponsive process fungal infection host plant rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'proper autophagy level coordinate development pathogenicity rice blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
19700558,A pair of allelic WRKY genes play opposite roles in rice-bacteria interactions.,"Although allelic diversity of genes has been reported to play important roles in different physiological processes, information on allelic diversity of defense-responsive genes in host-pathogen interactions is limited. Here, we report that a pair of allelic genes, OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2, which encode proteins with a 10-amino acid difference, play opposite roles in rice (Oryza sativa) resistance against bacterial pathogens. Bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo), bacterial streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola (Xoc), and fungal blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea are devastating diseases of rice worldwide. OsWRKY45-1-overexpressing plants showed increased susceptibility and OsWRKY45-1-knockout plants showed enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc. In contrast, OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance and OsWRKY45-2-suppressing plants showed increased susceptibility to Xoo and Xoc. Interestingly, both OsWRKY45-1- and OsWRKY45-2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance to M. grisea. OsWRKY45-1-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid and induced expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes, while OsWRKY45-2-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of jasmonic acid but not salicylic acid and induced expression of another subset of defense-responsive genes. These results suggest that both OsWRKY45-1 and OsWRKY45-2 are positive regulators in rice resistance against M. grisea, but the former is a negative regulator and the latter is a positive regulator in rice resistance against Xoo and Xoc. The opposite roles of the two allelic genes in rice-Xoo interaction appear to be due to their mediation of different defense signaling pathways.",although allelic diversity gene reported play important role different physiological process information allelic diversity defenseresponsive gene hostpathogen interaction limited report pair allelic gene oswrky oswrky encode protein amino acid difference play opposite role rice oryza sativa resistance bacterial pathogen bacterial blight caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo bacterial streak caused xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzicola xoc fungal blast caused magnaporthe grisea devastating disease rice worldwide oswrkyoverexpressing plant showed increased susceptibility oswrkyknockout plant showed enhanced resistance xoo xoc contrast oswrkyoverexpressing plant showed enhanced resistance oswrkysuppressing plant showed increased susceptibility xoo xoc interestingly oswrky oswrkyoverexpressing plant showed enhanced resistance grisea oswrkyregulated xoo resistance accompanied increased accumulation salicylic acid jasmonic acid induced expression subset defenseresponsive gene oswrkyregulated xoo resistance accompanied increased accumulation jasmonic acid salicylic acid induced expression another subset defenseresponsive gene result suggest oswrky oswrky positive regulator rice resistance grisea former negative regulator latter positive regulator rice resistance xoo xoc opposite role two allelic gene ricexoo interaction appear due mediation different defense signaling pathway,12,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe grisea devastating disease rice worldwide oswrkyoverexpressing plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1
29970347,A proteomic insight into the MSP1 and flg22 induced signaling in Oryza sativa leaves.,"Previously, we reported a novel Magnaporthe oryzae- secreted protein MSP1, which triggers cell death and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immune (PTI) responses in rice. To investigate the MSP1 induced defense response in rice at the protein level, we employed a label-free quantitative proteomic approach, in parallel with flg22 treatment, which is a well-known elicitor. Exogenous application of MSP1 to rice leaves induced an oxidative burst, MAPK3/6 activation, and activation of pathogenesis-related genes (DUF26, PBZ, and PR-10). MaxQuant based label free proteome analysis led to the identification of 4167 protein groups of which 433 showed significant differences in response to MSP1 and/or flg22 treatment. Functional annotation of the differential proteins showed that majority of the proteins related to primary, secondary, and lipid metabolism were decreased, while proteins associated mainly with the stress response, post-translational modification and signaling were increased in abundance. Moreover, several peroxidases and receptor kinases were induced by both the elicitors, highlighting their involvement in MSP1 and flg22 induced signaling in rice. Taken together, the results reported here contribute to our understanding of MSP1 and flg22 triggered immune responses at the proteome level, thereby increasing our overall understanding of PTI signaling in rice. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MSP1 is a M. oryzae secreted protein, which triggers defense responses in rice. Previous reports have shown that MSP1 is required for the pathogenicity of rice blast fungus, however, the exact mechanism of its action and its downstream targets in rice are currently unknown. Identification of the downstream targets is required in order to understand the MSP1 induced signaling in rice. Moreover, key proteins identified could also serve as potential candidates for the generation of disease resistance crops by modulating stress signaling pathways. Therefore, here we employed, for the first time, a label-free quantitative proteomic approach to investigate the MSP1 induced signaling in rice together with flg22. Functional annotation of the differential proteins showed that majority of the proteins related to primary, secondary, and lipid metabolism were decreased, while proteins related to the defense response, signaling and ROS detoxification were majorly increased. Thus, as an elicitor, recombinant MSP1 proteins could be utilized to inducing broad pathogen resistance in crops by priming the local immune responses.",previously reported novel magnaporthe oryzae secreted protein msp trigger cell death pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamptriggered immune pti response rice investigate msp induced defense response rice protein level employed labelfree quantitative proteomic approach parallel flg treatment wellknown elicitor exogenous application msp rice leaf induced oxidative burst mapk activation activation pathogenesisrelated gene duf pbz pr maxquant based label free proteome analysis led identification protein group showed significant difference response msp andor flg treatment functional annotation differential protein showed majority protein related primary secondary lipid metabolism decreased protein associated mainly stress response posttranslational modification signaling increased abundance moreover several peroxidase receptor kinase induced elicitors highlighting involvement msp flg induced signaling rice taken together result reported contribute understanding msp flg triggered immune response proteome level thereby increasing overall understanding pti signaling rice biological significance msp oryzae secreted protein trigger defense response rice previous report shown msp required pathogenicity rice blast fungus however exact mechanism action downstream target rice currently unknown identification downstream target required order understand msp induced signaling rice moreover key protein identified could also serve potential candidate generation disease resistance crop modulating stress signaling pathway therefore employed first time labelfree quantitative proteomic approach investigate msp induced signaling rice together flg functional annotation differential protein showed majority protein related primary secondary lipid metabolism decreased protein related defense response signaling ro detoxification majorly increased thus elicitor recombinant msp protein could utilized inducing broad pathogen resistance crop priming local immune response,4,"{'Disease': ['msp required pathogenicity rice blast fungus however exact mechanism action downstream target rice currently unknown identification downstream target required order'], 'Treatment': ['flg treatment wellknown elicitor exogenous application msp rice leaf', 'msp andor flg treatment functional annotation differential protein'], 'Symptom': []}",7
34524467,Feruloyl esterase Fae1 is required specifically for host colonisation by the rice-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Plant cell wall acts as a primary barrier for microbial pathogens during infection. A cell wall-degrading enzyme thus may be a crucial virulence factor, as it may aid the pathogen in successful host invasion. Nine genes coding for feruloyl esterases (Fae), likely involved in plant cell wall degradation, have been annotated in the genome of the cereal-blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. However, role of any Fae in pathogenicity of M. oryzae remains hitherto under explored. Here, we identified FAE1 gene (MGG_08737) that was significantly upregulated during host penetration and subsequent colonisation stages of infection. Accordingly, while deletion of FAE1 in M. oryzae did not affect the vegetative growth and asexual development, the fae1Δ mutant showed significantly reduced pathogenesis on rice plants, mainly due to impaired host invasion and colonisation. Very few (< 10%) fae1Δ appressoria that formed the primary invasive hyphae failed to elaborate from the first invaded cell to the neighbouring plant cells. Interestingly, exogenously added glucose, as a simple carbon source, or ferulic acid, a product of the Fae activity, significantly supported the invasive growth of the fae1Δ mutant. We show that the Fae1-based feruloyl esterase activity, by targeting the plant cell wall, plays an important role in accumulating ferulic acid and/or sugar molecules, as a likely energy source, to enable host invasion and colonisation by M. oryzae. Given its role in plant cell wall digestion and host colonisation, M. oryzae Fae1 could be a potential candidate for a novel antifungal strategy and a biotechnological application in biofuel production.",plant cell wall act primary barrier microbial pathogen infection cell walldegrading enzyme thus may crucial virulence factor may aid pathogen successful host invasion nine gene coding feruloyl esterases fae likely involved plant cell wall degradation annotated genome cerealblast fungus magnaporthe oryzae however role fae pathogenicity oryzae remains hitherto explored identified fae gene mgg significantly upregulated host penetration subsequent colonisation stage infection accordingly deletion fae oryzae affect vegetative growth asexual development faeδ mutant showed significantly reduced pathogenesis rice plant mainly due impaired host invasion colonisation faeδ appressoria formed primary invasive hypha failed elaborate first invaded cell neighbouring plant cell interestingly exogenously added glucose simple carbon source ferulic acid product fae activity significantly supported invasive growth faeδ mutant show faebased feruloyl esterase activity targeting plant cell wall play important role accumulating ferulic acid andor sugar molecule likely energy source enable host invasion colonisation oryzae given role plant cell wall digestion host colonisation oryzae fae could potential candidate novel antifungal strategy biotechnological application biofuel production,3,"{'Disease': ['plant cell wall degradation annotated genome cerealblast fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
31623772,Heat stress transcription factor OsSPL7 plays a critical role in reactive oxygen species balance and stress responses in rice.,"The rice spotted leaf gene, OsSPL7, induces lesion mimic (LM) spots under heat stress. Herein, we provide several lines of evidence elucidating the importance of OsSPL7 in maintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance via the regulation of downstream gene expression. osspl7 knockout (spl7ko) mutants showed LM and growth retardation. Transgenic rice lines strongly overexpressing OsSPL7 (SPL7OX-S) exhibited LM accompanied by accumulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas moderate expressers of OsSPL7 (SPL7OX-M) did not, and neither of them exhibited severe growth defects. Transient expression of OsSPL7-GFP in rice protoplasts indicated that OsSPL7 localizes predominantly in the nucleus. Transcriptional activity assay suggested its function as a transcriptional activator in rice. Disease evaluation showed that both SPL7OX and spl7ko enhanced resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agents of blast and blight diseases in rice, respectively. Additionally, SPL7OX enhanced tolerance to cold stress, whereas spl7ko showed a phenotype opposite to the overexpression lines. RNA sequencing analyses identified four major groups of differentially expressed genes associated with LM, pathogen resistance, LM-pathogen resistance, and potential direct targets of OsSPL7.

36835399,Identification of Elite <i>R</i>-Gene Combinations against Blast Disease in <i>Geng</i> Rice Varieties.,"Rice blast, caused by the <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> fungus, is one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide. Developing resistant varieties by pyramiding different blast resistance (<i>R</i>) genes is an effective approach to control the disease. However, due to complex interactions among <i>R</i> genes and crop genetic backgrounds, different <i>R</i>-gene combinations may have varying effects on resistance. Here, we report the identification of two core <i>R</i>-gene combinations that will benefit the improvement of <i>Geng</i> (<i>Japonica</i>) rice blast resistance. We first evaluated 68 <i>Geng</i> rice cultivars at seedling stage by challenging with 58 <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates. To evaluate panicle blast resistance, we inoculated 190 <i>Geng</i> rice cultivars at boosting stage with five groups of mixed conidial suspensions (MCSs), with each containing 5-6 isolates. More than 60% cultivars displayed moderate or lower levels of susceptibility to panicle blast against the five MCSs. Most cultivars contained two to six <i>R</i> genes detected by the functional markers corresponding to 18 known <i>R</i> genes. Through multinomial logistics regression analysis, we found that <i>Pi-zt</i>, <i>Pita</i>, <i>Pi3/5/I</i>, and <i>Pikh</i> loci contributed significantly to seedling blast resistance, and <i>Pita</i>, <i>Pi3/5/i</i>, <i>Pia</i>, and <i>Pit</i> contributed significantly to panicle blast resistance. For gene combinations, <i>Pita</i>+<i>Pi3/5/i</i> and <i>Pita</i>+<i>Pia</i> yielded more stable pyramiding effects on panicle blast resistance against all five MCSs and were designated as core <i>R</i>-gene combinations. Up to 51.6% <i>Geng</i> cultivars in the Jiangsu area contained <i>Pita</i>, but less than 30% harbored either <i>Pia</i> or <i>Pi3/5/i</i>, leading to less cultivars containing <i>Pita</i>+<i>Pia</i> (15.8%) or <i>Pita</i>+<i>Pi3/5/i</i> (5.8%). Only a few varieties simultaneously contained <i>Pia</i> and <i>Pi3/5/i</i>, implying the opportunity to use hybrid breeding procedures to efficiently generate varieties with either <i>Pita</i>+<i>Pia</i> or <i>Pita</i>+<i>Pi3/5/i</i>.

20615116,The basic leucine zipper transcription factor Moatf1 mediates oxidative stress responses and is necessary for full virulence of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast disease, leading to enormous losses of rice production. Here, we characterized a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, Moatf1, in M. oryzae, a homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe ATF/CREB that regulates the oxidative stress response. Moatf1 deletion caused retarded vegetative growth of mycelia, and the Moatf1 mutant exhibited higher sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) than did the wild-type strain. The mutant showed severely reduced activity of extracellular enzymes and transcription level of laccases and peroxidases and exhibited significantly reduced virulence on rice cultivar CO-39. On rice leaf sheath, most of the infectious hyphae of the mutant became swollen and displayed restricted growth in primary infected cells. Defense response was strongly activated in plants infected by the mutant. Diamino benzidine staining revealed an accumulation of H(2)O(2) around Moatf1 mutant appressoria and rice cells with Moatf1 hyphae that was absent in the wild type. Inhibition of the plant NADPH oxidase by diphenyleneiodonium prevented host-derived H(2)O(2) accumulation and restored infectious hyphal growth of the mutant in rice cells. Thus, we conclude that Moatf1 is necessary for full virulence of M. oryzae by regulating the transcription of laccases and peroxidases to impair reactive oxygen species-mediated plant defense.",magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease leading enormous loss rice production characterized basic leucine zipper bzip transcription factor moatf oryzae homolog schizosaccharomyces pombe atfcreb regulates oxidative stress response moatf deletion caused retarded vegetative growth mycelium moatf mutant exhibited higher sensitivity hydrogen peroxide ho wildtype strain mutant showed severely reduced activity extracellular enzyme transcription level laccases peroxidase exhibited significantly reduced virulence rice cultivar co rice leaf sheath infectious hypha mutant became swollen displayed restricted growth primary infected cell defense response strongly activated plant infected mutant diamino benzidine staining revealed accumulation ho around moatf mutant appressoria rice cell moatf hypha absent wild type inhibition plant nadph oxidase diphenyleneiodonium prevented hostderived ho accumulation restored infectious hyphal growth mutant rice cell thus conclude moatf necessary full virulence oryzae regulating transcription laccases peroxidase impair reactive oxygen speciesmediated plant defense,8,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",11
37474734,A molecular mechanosensor for real-time visualization of appressorium membrane tension in Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae uses a pressurized infection cell called an appressorium to drive a rigid penetration peg through the leaf cuticle. The vast internal pressure of an appressorium is very challenging to investigate, leaving our understanding of the cellular mechanics of plant infection incomplete. Here, using fluorescence lifetime imaging of a membrane-targeting molecular mechanoprobe, we quantify changes in membrane tension in M. oryzae. We show that extreme pressure in the appressorium leads to large-scale spatial heterogeneities in membrane mechanics, much greater than those observed in any cell type previously. By contrast, non-pathogenic melanin-deficient mutants, exhibit low spatially homogeneous membrane tension. The sensor kinase ∆sln1 mutant displays significantly higher membrane tension during inflation of the appressorium, providing evidence that Sln1 controls turgor throughout plant infection.

Sequence comparison and allelic analysis showed that R1/S16 and R8/S9 were two pairs of allelic genes. The full-length cDNA sequences of R1/S16, S17 and R8/S were obtained through cDNA library screening, in which only the expression level of R8 cDNA was up-regulated by inoculation with the blast isolate zh10814 and not affected by mock treatment, suggesting that R8 was implicated in the signaling pathways of the rice blast resistance reaction.

28125974,Nuclear and structural dynamics during the establishment of a specialized effector-secreting cell by Magnaporthe oryzae in living rice cells.,"To cause an economically important blast disease on rice, the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae forms a specialized infection structure, called an appressorium, to penetrate host cells. Once inside host cells, the fungus produces a filamentous primary hypha that differentiates into multicellular bulbous invasive hyphae (IH), which are surrounded by a host-derived membrane. These hyphae secrete cytoplasmic effectors that enter host cells presumably via the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC). The first IH cell, also known as the side BIC-associated cell, is a specialized effector-secreting cell essential for a successful infection. This study aims to determine cellular processes that lead to the development of this effector-secreting first IH cell inside susceptible rice cells. Using live-cell confocal imaging, we determined a series of cellular events by which the appressorium gives rise to the first IH cell in live rice cells. The filamentous primary hypha extended from the appressorium and underwent asymmetric swelling at its apex. The single nucleus in the appressorium divided, and then one nucleus migrated into the swollen apex. Septation occurred in the filamentous region of the primary hypha, establishing the first IH cell. The tip BIC that was initially associated with the primary hypha became the side BIC on the swollen apex prior to nuclear division in the appressorium. The average distance between the early side BIC and the nearest nucleus in the appressorium was estimated to be more than 32 μm. These results suggest an unknown mechanism by which effectors that are expressed in the appressorium are transported through the primary hypha for their secretion into the distantly located BIC. When M. oryzae was inoculated on heat-killed rice cells, penetration proceeded as normal, but there was no differentiation of a bulbous IH cell, suggesting its specialization for establishment of biotrophic infection. Our studies reveal cellular dynamics associated with the development of the effector-secreting first IH cell. Our data raise new mechanistic questions concerning hyphal differentiation in response to host environmental cues and effector trafficking from the appressorium to the BIC.",cause economically important blast disease rice filamentous fungus magnaporthe oryzae form specialized infection structure called appressorium penetrate host cell inside host cell fungus produce filamentous primary hypha differentiates multicellular bulbous invasive hypha ih surrounded hostderived membrane hypha secrete cytoplasmic effector enter host cell presumably via biotrophic interfacial complex bic first ih cell also known side bicassociated cell specialized effectorsecreting cell essential successful infection study aim determine cellular process lead development effectorsecreting first ih cell inside susceptible rice cell using livecell confocal imaging determined series cellular event appressorium give rise first ih cell live rice cell filamentous primary hypha extended appressorium underwent asymmetric swelling apex single nucleus appressorium divided one nucleus migrated swollen apex septation occurred filamentous region primary hypha establishing first ih cell tip bic initially associated primary hypha became side bic swollen apex prior nuclear division appressorium average distance early side bic nearest nucleus appressorium estimated μm result suggest unknown mechanism effector expressed appressorium transported primary hypha secretion distantly located bic oryzae inoculated heatkilled rice cell penetration proceeded normal differentiation bulbous ih cell suggesting specialization establishment biotrophic infection study reveal cellular dynamic associated development effectorsecreting first ih cell data raise new mechanistic question concerning hyphal differentiation response host environmental cue effector trafficking appressorium bic,3,"{'Disease': ['economically important blast disease rice', 'filamentous fungus', 'host cell fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['hostderived membrane hypha secrete cytoplasmic effector', 'unknown mechanism effector', 'hyphal differentiation response host environmental cue effector trafficking appressorium bic']}",9
26681057,"Expression of Magnaporthe oryzae genes encoding cysteine-rich proteins secreted during nitrogen starvation and interaction with its host, Oryza sativa.","Previous studies have shown that the blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, may experience nitrogen starvation during infection of its plant host (rice,Oryza sativa). Here, we studied the expression of seven genes encoding cysteine-rich proteins with N-terminal signal peptides during nitrogen limitation and throughout the infection process. Some genes were upregulated to a greater extent in weak pathogenic strains than in strong pathogenic strains when they were cultured in complete media, and the expression of some genes was higher in both weak and strong pathogenic strains cultured in 1/10-N and nitrogen starvation media. Furthermore, the expression of these genes was upregulated to different extents in the early stages of M. oryzae infection. These data demonstrate that the genes of interest are highly expressed in weak and strong pathogenic strains cultured under nitrogen limitation and at the early stage of the infection process. This indicates that cysteine-rich secreted proteins in the blast fungus might be involved in establishing disease in the host and that they are sensitive to nitrogen levels. Thus, their role in sensing nitrogen availability within the host is implied, which provides a basis for further functional identification of these genes and their products during plant infection.",previous study shown blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae may experience nitrogen starvation infection plant host riceoryza sativa studied expression seven gene encoding cysteinerich protein nterminal signal peptide nitrogen limitation throughout infection process gene upregulated greater extent weak pathogenic strain strong pathogenic strain cultured complete medium expression gene higher weak strong pathogenic strain cultured n nitrogen starvation medium furthermore expression gene upregulated different extent early stage oryzae infection data demonstrate gene interest highly expressed weak strong pathogenic strain cultured nitrogen limitation early stage infection process indicates cysteinerich secreted protein blast fungus might involved establishing disease host sensitive nitrogen level thus role sensing nitrogen availability within host implied provides basis functional identification gene product plant infection,3,"{'Disease': ['blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae', 'secreted protein blast fungus', 'disease host sensitive nitrogen level'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",1

We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors. Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMT2b showed increased susceptibility to bacterial blight and blast fungus. OsMT2b-overexpressing cells showed reduced elicitor-induced hydrogen peroxide production. In contrast, homozygous OsMT2b::Tos17-inserted mutant and OsMT2b-RNAi-silenced transgenic cells showed significantly higher elicitor-induced hydrogen peroxide production than the wild-type cells. In vitro assay showed that recombinant OsMT2b protein possessed superoxide- and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activities. Taken together, these results showed that OsMT2b is an ROS scavenger and its expression is down-regulated by OsRac1, thus potentiating ROS, which function as signals in resistance response.

32112568,Sclerenchyma cell thickening through enhanced lignification induced by OsMYB30 prevents fungal penetration of rice leaves.,"Broad-spectrum resistance is highly preferred in crop breeding programmes. Previously, we have reported the identification of the broad-spectrum resistance-Digu 1 (bsr-d1) allele from rice Digu. The bsr-d1 allele prevents activation of Bsr-d1 expression by Magnaporthe oryzae infection and degradation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> by peroxidases, leading to resistance to M. oryzae. However, it remains unknown whether defence pathways other than H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> burst and peroxidases contribute to the bsr-d1-mediated immunity. Blast resistance was determined in rice leaves by spray and punch inoculations. Target genes of OsMYB30 were identified by one-hybrid assays in yeast and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Lignin content was measured by phloroglucinol-HCl staining, and acetyl bromide and thioacidolysis methods. Here, we report the involvement of the OsMYB30 gene in bsr-d1-mediated blast resistance. Expression of OsMYB30 was induced during M. oryzae infection or when Bsr-d1 was knocked out or downregulated, as occurs in bsr-d1 plants upon infection. We further found that OsMYB30 bound to and activated the promoters of 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase genes (Os4CL3 and Os4CL5) resulting in accumulation of lignin subunits G and S. This action led to obvious thickening of sclerenchyma cells near the epidermis, inhibiting M. oryzae penetration at the early stage of infection.

39349087,Characterisation and evolution of the PRC2 complex and its functional analysis under various stress conditions in rice.,"The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a chromatin-associated methyltransferase responsible for catalysing the trimethylation of H3K27, an inhibitory chromatin marker associated with gene silencing. This enzymatic activity is crucial for normal organismal development and the maintenance of gene expression patterns that preserve cellular identity, subsequently influencing plant growth and abiotic stress responses. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the evolutionary characteristics and functional roles of PRC2 in plants. We identified 209 PRC2 genes, including E(z), Su(z), Esc, and Nurf55 families, using 18 representative plant species and revealed that recent gene replication events have led to an expansion in the Nurf55 family, resulting in a greater number of members compared to the E(z), Su(z), and Esc families. Furthermore, protein structure and motif composition analyses highlighted the potential functional site regions within PRC2 members. In addition, we selected rice, a representative monocotyledonous plant, as the model species for food crops. Our findings revealed that SDG711, SDG718, and MSI1-5 genes were induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and/or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) hormones, suggesting that these genes play an important role in abiotic stress and disease resistance. Further experiments involving rice blast fungus treatments confirmed that the expression of SDG711 and MSI1-5 was induced by Magnaporthe oryzae strain GUY11. Multiple protein interaction assays revealed that the M. oryzae effector AvrPiz-t interacts with PRC2 core member SDG711 to increase H3K27me3 levels. Notably, inhibition of PRC2 or mutation of SDG711 enhanced rice resistance to M. oryzae.

15584956,Endogenous salicylic acid protects rice plants from oxidative damage caused by aging as well as biotic and abiotic stress.,"Salicylic acid (SA) is a key endogenous signal that mediates defense gene expression and disease resistance in many dicotyledonous species. In contrast to tobacco and Arabidopsis, which contain low basal levels of SA, rice has two orders of magnitude higher levels of SA and appears to be insensitive to exogenous SA treatment. To determine the role of SA in rice plants, we have generated SA-deficient transgenic rice by expressing the bacterial salicylate hydroxylase that degrades SA. Depletion of high levels of endogenous SA in transgenic rice does not measurably affect defense gene expression, but reduces the plant's capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). SA-deficient transgenic rice contains elevated levels of superoxide and H2O2, and exhibits spontaneous lesion formation in an age- and light-dependent manner. Exogenous application of SA analog benzothiadiazole complements SA deficiency and suppresses ROI levels and lesion formation. Although an increase of conjugated catechol was detected in SA-deficient rice, catechol does not appear to significantly affect ROI levels based on the endogenous catechol data and exogenous catechol treatment. When infected with the blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), SA-deficient rice exhibits increased susceptibility to oxidative bursts elicited by avirulent isolates. Furthermore, SA-deficient rice is hyperresponsive to oxidative damage caused by paraquat treatment. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that SA plays an important role to modulate redox balance and protect rice plants from oxidative stress.",salicylic acid sa key endogenous signal mediates defense gene expression disease resistance many dicotyledonous specie contrast tobacco arabidopsis contain low basal level sa rice two order magnitude higher level sa appears insensitive exogenous sa treatment determine role sa rice plant generated sadeficient transgenic rice expressing bacterial salicylate hydroxylase degrades sa depletion high level endogenous sa transgenic rice measurably affect defense gene expression reduces plant capacity detoxify reactive oxygen intermediate roi sadeficient transgenic rice contains elevated level superoxide ho exhibit spontaneous lesion formation age lightdependent manner exogenous application sa analog benzothiadiazole complement sa deficiency suppresses roi level lesion formation although increase conjugated catechol detected sadeficient rice catechol appear significantly affect roi level based endogenous catechol data exogenous catechol treatment infected blast fungus magnaporthe grisea sadeficient rice exhibit increased susceptibility oxidative burst elicited avirulent isolates furthermore sadeficient rice hyperresponsive oxidative damage caused paraquat treatment taken together result strongly suggest sa play important role modulate redox balance protect rice plant oxidative stress,4,"{'Disease': ['salicylic acid sa key endogenous signal mediates defense gene expression disease resistance'], 'Treatment': ['insensitive exogenous sa treatment determine role sa rice plant', 'paraquat treatment'], 'Symptom': []}",7

11552692,Structure-based design of inhibitors of the rice blast fungal enzyme trihydroxynaphthalene reductase.,"Rice Blast Disease, caused by the fungus Pyricularia oryzae, is one of the most important diseases of rice. Several enzymes in the melanin biosynthetic pathway have proven to be valuable targets for development of rice blast fungicides. In particular, inhibitors of trihydroxynaphthalene reductase (3HNR), which catalyzes the conversion of trihydroxynaphthalene to vermelone, have yielded commercially useful rice fungicides. The X-ray structure of 3HNR has been published recently, presenting an opportunity to use this information in the de novo design of novel 3HNR inhibitors that may exhibit useful rice blast activity. We used the LeapFrog program to develop a docking model for interaction of ligands with the active site of THNR. The final model gave a good correlation between calculated binding energy and log Ki and was used to design novel ligands and score compounds for synthesis. Using this as a tool, we synthesized inhibitors in the nanomolar range and also developed several inhibitors that did not conform to the properties of the THNR active site.

17142568,Expression of Magnaporthe grisea avirulence gene ACE1 is connected to the initiation of appressorium-mediated penetration.,"Magnaporthe grisea is responsible for a devastating fungal disease of rice called blast. Current control of this disease relies on resistant rice cultivars that recognize M. grisea signals corresponding to specific secreted proteins encoded by avirulence genes. The M. grisea ACE1 avirulence gene differs from others, since it controls the biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite likely recognized by rice cultivars carrying the Pi33 resistance gene. Using a transcriptional fusion between ACE1 promoter and eGFP, we showed that ACE1 is only expressed in appressoria during fungal penetration into rice and barley leaves, onion skin, and cellophane membranes. ACE1 is almost not expressed in appressoria differentiated on Teflon and Mylar artificial membranes. ACE1 expression is not induced by cellophane and plant cell wall components, demonstrating that it does not require typical host plant compounds. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling mutants delta cpkA and delta mac1 sum1-99 and tetraspanin mutant delta pls1::hph differentiate melanized appressoria with normal turgor but are unable to penetrate host plant leaves. ACE1 is normally expressed in these mutants, suggesting that it does not require cAMP signaling or a successful penetration event. ACE1 is not expressed in appressoria of the buf1::hph mutant defective for melanin biosynthesis and appressorial turgor. The addition of hyperosmotic solutes to buf1::hph appressoria restores appressorial development and ACE1 expression. Treatments of young wild-type appressoria with actin and tubulin inhibitors reduce both fungal penetration and ACE1 expression. These experiments suggest that ACE1 appressorium-specific expression does not depend on host plant signals but is connected to the onset of appressorium-mediated penetration.",magnaporthe grisea responsible devastating fungal disease rice called blast current control disease relies resistant rice cultivar recognize grisea signal corresponding specific secreted protein encoded avirulence gene grisea ace avirulence gene differs others since control biosynthesis secondary metabolite likely recognized rice cultivar carrying pi resistance gene using transcriptional fusion ace promoter egfp showed ace expressed appressoria fungal penetration rice barley leaf onion skin cellophane membrane ace almost expressed appressoria differentiated teflon mylar artificial membrane ace expression induced cellophane plant cell wall component demonstrating require typical host plant compound cyclic amp camp signaling mutant delta cpka delta mac sum tetraspanin mutant delta plshph differentiate melanized appressoria normal turgor unable penetrate host plant leaf ace normally expressed mutant suggesting require camp signaling successful penetration event ace expressed appressoria bufhph mutant defective melanin biosynthesis appressorial turgor addition hyperosmotic solute bufhph appressoria restores appressorial development ace expression treatment young wildtype appressoria actin tubulin inhibitor reduce fungal penetration ace expression experiment suggest ace appressoriumspecific expression depend host plant signal connected onset appressoriummediated penetration,3,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe grisea responsible devastating fungal disease rice', 'blast current control disease'], 'Treatment': ['appressorial development ace expression treatment young wildtype appressoria actin tubulin inhibitor'], 'Symptom': []}",7

25110136,Pre-illumination of rice blast conidia induces tolerance to subsequent oxidative stress.,"Many environmental factors, alone or combined, affect organisms by changing a pro-/antioxidant balance. Here we tested rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) for possible cross-adaptations caused by relatively intense light and protecting from artificially formed reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-dependent fungitoxic response of the host plant. Spore germination was found to be suppressed under 4-h and, to larger extent, 5-h illumination. The effect was diminished by antioxidants and, therefore, suggests involvement of ROS. One-hour of light did not affect spore germination, but stimulated their chemically assayed superoxide production. The illuminated spores were more tolerant (than non-illuminated ones) to artificially generated H(2)O(2), O(2)(-), or OH or to toxic diffusate of rice leaf. They also caused more severe disease symptoms if applied to leaves of the susceptible rice cultivar at low concentration. Spore diffusates decomposed hydrogen peroxide. They detoxified exogenous H(2)O(2) and superoxide radical as well as leaf diffusates. Spore illumination increased some of these protective effects. It is suggested that short-term light led to mild oxidative stress, which induced spore antioxidant capacity, enhancing spore tolerance to subsequent stronger oxidative stress and its aggressiveness in planta. Such tolerance depends partly on the antidotal action of spore extracellular compounds, which may also be light-stimulated. Therefore, a certain ROS-related environmental factor may adapt a fungus to other factors and so modulate its pathogenic properties.",many environmental factor alone combined affect organism changing proantioxidant balance tested rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae possible crossadaptations caused relatively intense light protecting artificially formed reactive oxygen specie ro rosdependent fungitoxic response host plant spore germination found suppressed h larger extent h illumination effect diminished antioxidant therefore suggests involvement ro onehour light affect spore germination stimulated chemically assayed superoxide production illuminated spore tolerant nonilluminated one artificially generated ho oh toxic diffusate rice leaf also caused severe disease symptom applied leaf susceptible rice cultivar low concentration spore diffusates decomposed hydrogen peroxide detoxified exogenous ho superoxide radical well leaf diffusates spore illumination increased protective effect suggested shortterm light led mild oxidative stress induced spore antioxidant capacity enhancing spore tolerance subsequent stronger oxidative stress aggressiveness planta tolerance depends partly antidotal action spore extracellular compound may also lightstimulated therefore certain rosrelated environmental factor may adapt fungus factor modulate pathogenic property,6,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae possible crossadaptations', 'severe disease symptom applied leaf susceptible rice cultivar low concentration spore', 'fungus factor'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['h illumination effect', 'severe disease symptom applied leaf susceptible rice cultivar low concentration spore']}",2

AVR1-CO39 homologs were exclusively present in one species, Pyricularia oryzae, suggesting that AVR1-CO39 appeared during the early stage of evolution of P. oryzae.

Nevertheless, Oryza isolates (isolates virulent on Oryza spp.) in P. oryzae were exceptionally noncarriers of AVR1-CO39. All Oryza isolates suffered from one of the two types of known rearrangements at the Avr1-CO39 locus (i.e., G type and J type). These types were congruous to the two major lineages of Oryza isolates from Japan determined by MGR586 and MAGGY. These results indicate that AVR1-CO39 was lost during the early stage of evolution of the Oryza-specific subgroup of P. oryzae.

18950187,Prediction of fungicidal activities of rice blast disease based on least-squares support vector machines and project pursuit regression.,"Three machine learning methods, genetic algorithm-multilinear regression (GA-MLR), least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and project pursuit regression (PPR), were used to investigate the relationship between thiazoline derivatives and their fungicidal activities against the rice blast disease. The GA-MLR method was used to select the most appropriate molecular descriptors from a large set of descriptors, which were only calculated from molecular structures, and develop a linear quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model at the same time. On the basis of the selected descriptors, the other two more accurate models (LS-SVM and PPR) were built. Both the linear and nonlinear modes gave good prediction results, but the nonlinear models afforded better prediction ability, which meant that the LS-SVM and PPR methods could simulate the relationship between the structural descriptors and fungicidal activities more accurately. The results show that the nonlinear methods (LS-SVM and PPR) could be used as good modeling tools for the study of rice blast. Moreover, this study provides a new and simple but efficient approach, which should facilitate the design and development of new compounds to resist the rice blast disease.",three machine learning method genetic algorithmmultilinear regression gamlr leastsquares support vector machine lssvm project pursuit regression ppr used investigate relationship thiazoline derivative fungicidal activity rice blast disease gamlr method used select appropriate molecular descriptor large set descriptor calculated molecular structure develop linear quantitative structureactivity relationship qsar model time basis selected descriptor two accurate model lssvm ppr built linear nonlinear mode gave good prediction result nonlinear model afforded better prediction ability meant lssvm ppr method could simulate relationship structural descriptor fungicidal activity accurately result show nonlinear method lssvm ppr could used good modeling tool study rice blast moreover study provides new simple efficient approach facilitate design development new compound resist rice blast disease,8,"{'Disease': ['thiazoline derivative fungicidal activity rice blast disease gamlr method', 'new simple efficient approach facilitate design development new compound resist rice blast disease'], 'Treatment': ['three machine learning method genetic algorithmmultilinear regression gamlr leastsquares', 'thiazoline derivative fungicidal activity rice blast disease gamlr method', 'lssvm ppr method', 'nonlinear method lssvm ppr'], 'Symptom': []}",3
33471560,The Risk of Wheat Blast in Rice-Wheat Co-Planting Regions in China: MoO Strains of <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> Cause Typical Symptom and Host Reaction on Both Wheat Leaves and Spikes.,"The <i>Triticum</i> pathotype of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (syn. <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i>) causes wheat blast, which has recently spread to Asia. To assess the potential risk of wheat blast in rice-wheat growing regions, we investigated the pathogenicity of 14 isolates of <i>P. oryzae</i> on 32 wheat cultivars, among which <i>Oryzae</i> pathotype of <i>P. oryzae</i> (MoO) isolates were completely avirulent on the wheat cultivars at 22°C but caused various degrees of infection 25°C. These reactions at 25°C were isolate and cultivar dependent, like race-cultivar specificity, which was also recognized at the heading stage and caused typical blast symptoms on spikes. Microscopic analyses indicated that a compatible MoO isolate produced appressoria and infection hyphae on wheat as on rice. When we compared transcriptomes in wheat-MoO interactions, the bulk of pathogen-related genes were upregulated or downregulated in compatible and incompatible patterns, but changes in gene transcription were more significant in a compatible pattern. These results indicate that temperature could influence the infection ratio of wheat with MoO, and some MoO strains could be potential pathogens that increase the risk of wheat blast outbreaks in wheat-rice growing regions with global warming. In addition, certain wheat cultivars exhibited resistance and are assumed to carry resistance-promoting genes to the MoO strains.",itriticumi pathotype imagnaporthe oryzaei syn ipyricularia oryzaei cause wheat blast recently spread asia assess potential risk wheat blast ricewheat growing region investigated pathogenicity isolates ip oryzaei wheat cultivar among ioryzaei pathotype ip oryzaei moo isolates completely avirulent wheat cultivar °c caused various degree infection °c reaction °c isolate cultivar dependent like racecultivar specificity also recognized heading stage caused typical blast symptom spike microscopic analysis indicated compatible moo isolate produced appressoria infection hypha wheat rice compared transcriptomes wheatmoo interaction bulk pathogenrelated gene upregulated downregulated compatible incompatible pattern change gene transcription significant compatible pattern result indicate temperature could influence infection ratio wheat moo moo strain could potential pathogen increase risk wheat blast outbreak wheatrice growing region global warming addition certain wheat cultivar exhibited resistance assumed carry resistancepromoting gene moo strain,11,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['typical blast symptom']}",8

To further explore the effect of IBC on the cell wall of <i>M. grisea</i>, we examined changes in enzymes associated with cell wall degradation by enzyme activity experiments, treated liquid culture mycelia with 10 mg/L IBC for 1 h. Results displayed that chitinase was obviously more active than control group. To illustrate the interactions between IBC and chitinase, the studies of homology modeling and molecular docking were carried out successively.

35506374,Homeostasis of cell wall integrity pathway phosphorylation is required for the growth and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The cell wall provides a crucial barrier to stress imposed by the external environment. In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, this stress response is mediated by the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, consisting of a well-characterized protein phosphorylation cascade. However, other regulators that maintain CWI phosphorylation homeostasis, such as protein phosphatases (PPases), remain unclear. Here, we identified two PPases, MoPtc1 and MoPtc2, that function as negative regulators of the CWI pathway. MoPtc1 and MoPtc2 interact with MoMkk1, one of the key components of the CWI pathway, and are crucial for the vegetative growth, conidial formation, and virulence of M. oryzae. We also demonstrate that both MoPtc1 and MoPtc2 dephosphorylate MoMkk1 in vivo and in vitro, and that CWI stress leads to enhanced interaction between MoPtc1 and MoMkk1. CWI stress abolishes the interaction between MoPtc2 and MoMkk1, providing a means of deactivation for CWI signalling.

36424609,"The extrachromosomal circular DNAs of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae contain a wide variety of LTR retrotransposons, genes, and effectors.","One of the ways genomes respond to stress is by producing extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs). EccDNAs can contain genes and dramatically increase their copy number. They can also reinsert into the genome, generating structural variation. They have been shown to provide a source of phenotypic and genotypic plasticity in several species. However, whole circularome studies have so far been limited to a few model organisms. Fungal plant pathogens are a serious threat to global food security in part because of their rapid adaptation to disease prevention strategies. Understanding the mechanisms fungal pathogens use to escape disease control is paramount to curbing their threat. We present a whole circularome sequencing study of the rice blast pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. We find that M. oryzae has a highly diverse circularome that contains many genes and shows evidence of large LTR retrotransposon activity. We find that genes enriched on eccDNAs in M. oryzae occur in genomic regions prone to presence-absence variation and that disease-associated genes are frequently on eccDNAs. Finally, we find that a subset of genes is never present on eccDNAs in our data, which indicates that the presence of these genes on eccDNAs is selected against. Our study paves the way to understanding how eccDNAs contribute to adaptation in M. oryzae.

Rice blast is the most serious disease of cultivated rice and therefore poses a threat to the world's most important food security crop. Here, I review recent progress toward understanding the molecular biology of plant infection by M. grisea, which involves development of a specialized cell, the appressorium. This dome-shaped cell generates enormous turgor pressure and physical force, allowing the fungus to breach the host cuticle and invade plant tissue. The review also considers the role of avirulence genes in M. grisea and the mechanisms by which resistant rice cultivars are able to perceive the fungus and defend themselves. Finally, the likely mechanisms that promote genetic diversity in M. grisea and our current understanding of the population structure of the blast fungus are evaluated.",blast fungus magnaporthe grisea cause serious disease wide variety grass including rice wheat barley rice blast serious disease cultivated rice therefore pose threat world important food security crop review recent progress toward understanding molecular biology plant infection grisea involves development specialized cell appressorium domeshaped cell generates enormous turgor pressure physical force allowing fungus breach host cuticle invade plant tissue review also considers role avirulence gene grisea mechanism resistant rice cultivar able perceive fungus defend finally likely mechanism promote genetic diversity grisea current understanding population structure blast fungus evaluated,3,"{'Disease': ['serious disease wide variety grass', 'fungus breach host cuticle', 'able perceive fungus defend', 'genetic diversity grisea current understanding population structure blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
29943213,Interactive effects of Magnaporthe inoculation and nitrogen doses on the plant enzyme machinery and phyllosphere microbiome of resistant and susceptible rice cultivars.,"Severity of plant diseases is often influenced by the availability of nutrients, particularly N; however, its effect on the phyllosphere microbiome in foliar pathogen challenged plants is less investigated in rice. The tripartite interaction among the fungal pathogen (Magnaporthe oryzae), rice cultivars (basmati and non-basmati, blast resistant or susceptible) and nitrogen (N) fertilization (0, 120 and 180 N) was investigated. Plant growth, elicitation of defense responses and abundance of microbial members in the rice phyllosphere were monitored using biochemical and molecular methods. In general, photosynthetic pigments were distinct for each cultivar, and optimal N doses led to higher values. The susceptible var. CO-39 and resistant CO-39I exhibited higher contents of photosynthetic pigments and micronutrients such as zinc in leaves in response to N doses. Elicitation of defense and hydrolytic enzymes was significantly influenced by pathogen inoculation and modulated by N doses, but varietal effects were distinct. Scoring indices emphasized the pathogen susceptibility of var. CO-39 and PB-1, which showed almost 40-60% higher values than the resistant cultivars; the interactions of cultivars and N doses was also significant. Characteristic changes were recorded in the abundances of the gene copies, particularly, with an overall increase in the number of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA, and bacterial amoA in pathogen-challenged treatments, while nifH gene copies exhibited a reducing trend with increasing N doses, in the presence or absence of pathogen.

15597739,"Gene discovery and gene expression in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea: analysis of expressed sequence tags.","Over 28,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were produced from cDNA libraries representing a variety of growth conditions and cell types. Several Magnaporthe grisea strains were used to produce the libraries, including a nonpathogenic strain bearing a mutation in the PMK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Approximately 23,000 of the ESTs could be clustered into 3,050 contigs, leaving 5,127 singleton sequences. The estimate of 8,177 unique sequences indicates that over half of the genes of the fungus are represented in the ESTs.

12081375,Inducibility by pathogen attack and developmental regulation of the rice Ltp1 gene.,"Using a genomic clone encoding a rice lipid transfer protein, LTP1, we analysed the activity of the 5' region of the Ltp1 gene in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) during plant development and under pathogen attack. The -1176/+13, -556/+13 and -284/+13 regions of the promoter were fused upstream from the uidA reporter gene and nos 3' polyadenylation signal, resulting in the pdelta1176Gus, pdelta556Gus and pdelta284Gus constructs which were transferred to rice by microprojectile bombardment. Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assays and in situ detection of uidA transcripts in transgenic homozygous lines harbouring the pdelta1176Gus construct demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is preferentially active in aerial vegetative and reproductive organs and that both specificity and level of expression are regulated during organ development. In leaf sheath, GUS activity which is initially strictly localized in the epidermis of growing tissue, becomes restricted to the vascular system in mature tissues. In expanded leaf blade, expression of the uidA gene was restricted to the cutting level suggesting inducibility by wounding. Strong activity was detected in lemma and palea, sterile glumes, and immature anther walls and microspores but not in female reproductive organs. No GUS activity was detected during seed embryo maturation whereas the uidA gene was strongly expressed at early stages of somatic embryogenesis in scutellum tissue. The Ltp1 transcripts were found to strongly accumulate in response to inoculation with the fungal agent of the blast disease, Magnaporthe grisea, in two rice cultivars exhibiting compatible or incompatible host-pathogen interactions. Analysis of pdelta1176Gus leaf samples inoculated with the blast fungus demonstrated that the Ltp1 promoter is induced in all cell types of tissues surrounding the lesion and notably in stomata guard cells. In plants harbouring the Ltp1 promoter deletion construct pdelta556Gus, activity was solely detected in the vascular system of mature leaves whereas no uidA gene expression was observed in pdelta284Gus plants.

28758876,WRKY45 phosphorylation at threonine 266 acts negatively on WRKY45-dependent blast resistance in rice.,"WRKY45 is a central regulator of disease resistance mediated by salicylic acid signaling in rice and its activation involves phosphorylation by OsMPK6. OsMPK6 phosphorylates WRKY45 at Thr266, Ser294, and Ser299 in vitro. Phosphorylation of Ser294 and/or Ser299 is required for full activation of WRKY45, but the importance of Thr266 phosphorylation has remained unknown.

Replacement of Thr266 by Asn did not affect the enhanced Magnaporthe oryzae resistance afforded by WRKY45 overexpression. By contrast, replacement by Asp negated the enhancement of M. oryzae resistance.

To explore the genomic basis of improved yield and disease resistance in GJ rice, we conducted a large-scale genomic landscape analysis of 816 elite GJ cultivars representing multiple eras of germplasm from China. We detected consistently increasing introgressions from three XI subpopulations into GJ cultivars since the 1980s and found that the XI genome introgressions significantly increased the grain number per panicle (GN) and decreased the panicle number per plant. This contributed to the improvement of plant type during modern breeding, changing multi-tiller plants to moderate tiller plants with a large panicle size and increasing the blast resistance. Notably, we found that key gene haplotypes controlling plant architecture, yield components, and pest and disease resistance, including IPA1, SMG1, DEP3, Pib, Pi-d2, and Bph3, were introduced from XI rice by introgression. By GWAS analysis, we detected a GN-related gene Gnd5, which had been consistently introgressed from XI into GJ cultivars since the 1980s. Gnd5 is a GRAS transcription factor gene, and Gnd5 knockout mutants showed a significant reduction in GN. The estimated genetic effects of genes varied among different breeding locations, which explained the distinct introgression levels of XI gene haplotypes, including Gnd5, DEP3, etc., to these GJ breeding pedigrees.

Here, we show that NADPH oxidases (Nox) are necessary for septin-mediated reorientation of the F-actin cytoskeleton to facilitate cuticle rupture and plant cell invasion. We report that the Nox2-NoxR complex spatially organizes a heteroligomeric septin ring at the appressorium pore, required for assembly of a toroidal F-actin network at the point of penetration peg emergence. Maintenance of the cortical F-actin network during plant infection independently requires Nox1, a second NADPH oxidase, which is necessary for penetration hypha elongation. Organization of F-actin in appressoria is disrupted by application of antioxidants, whereas latrunculin-mediated depolymerization of appressorial F-actin is competitively inhibited by reactive oxygen species, providing evidence that regulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species by fungal NADPH oxidases directly controls septin and F-actin dynamics.",rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae infects plant specialized cell called appressorium us turgor drive rigid penetration peg rice leaf cuticle show nadph oxidase nox necessary septinmediated reorientation factin cytoskeleton facilitate cuticle rupture plant cell invasion report noxnoxr complex spatially organizes heteroligomeric septin ring appressorium pore required assembly toroidal factin network point penetration peg emergence maintenance cortical factin network plant infection independently requires nox second nadph oxidase necessary penetration hypha elongation organization factin appressoria disrupted application antioxidant whereas latrunculinmediated depolymerization appressorial factin competitively inhibited reactive oxygen specie providing evidence regulated synthesis reactive oxygen specie fungal nadph oxidase directly control septin factin dynamic,3,"{'Disease': ['rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae infects'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9
17464219,Identification of putative MAPK kinases in Oryza minuta and O. sativa responsive to biotic stresses.,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade is critical for regulating plant defense systems against various kinds of pathogen and environmental stresses. One component of this cascade, the MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK), has not yet been shown to be induced in plants following biotic attacks, such as those by insects and fungi. We describe here a gene coding for a blast (Magnaporthe grisea)- and insect (Nilaparvata lugens)-responsive putative MAPK kinase, OmMKK1 (Oryza minuta MAPKK 1), which was identified in a library of O. minuta expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Two copies of OmMKK1 are present in the O. minuta genome. They encode a predicted protein with molecular mass 39 kDa and pI of 6.2. Transcript patterns following imbibition of plant hormones such as methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA), ethephone, salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA), as well as exposure to methyl viologen (MV), revealed that the expression of OmMKK1 is related to defense response signaling pathways.

31828801,Terminating rice innate immunity induction requires a network of antagonistic and redox-responsive E3 ubiquitin ligases targeting a fungal sirtuin.,"Fungal phytopathogens can suppress plant immune mechanisms in order to colonize living host cells. Identifying all the molecular components involved is critical for elaborating a detailed systems-level model of plant infection probing pathogen weaknesses; yet, the hierarchy of molecular events controlling fungal responses to the plant cell is not clear. Here we show how, in the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, terminating rice innate immunity requires a dynamic network of redox-responsive E3 ubiquitin ligases targeting fungal sirtuin 2 (Sir2), an antioxidation regulator required for suppressing the host oxidative burst. Immunoblotting, immunopurification, mass spectrometry and gene functional analyses showed that Sir2 levels responded to oxidative stress via a mechanism involving ubiquitination and three antagonistic E3 ubiquitin ligases: Grr1 and Ptr1 maintained basal Sir2 levels in the absence of oxidative stress; Upl3 facilitated Sir2 accumulation in response to oxidative stress. Grr1 and Upl3 interacted directly with Sir2 in a manner that decreased and scaled with oxidative stress, respectively. Deleting UPL3 depleted Sir2 during growth in rice cells, triggering host immunity and preventing infection. Overexpressing SIR2 in the Δupl3 mutant remediated pathogenicity.

22661208,Genomic organization and sequence dynamics of the AvrPiz-t locus in Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Plants utilize multiple layers of defense mechanisms to fight against the invasion of diverse pathogens. The R gene mediates resistance, in most cases, dependent on the co-existence of its cognate pathogen-derived avirulence (Avr) gene. The rice blast R gene Piz-t corresponds in gene-for-gene fashion to the Magnaporthe oryzae Avr gene AvrPiz-t. In this study, we determined and compared the genomic sequences surrounding the AvrPiz-t gene in both avirulent and virulent isolates, designating as AvrPiz-t-ZB15 and avrPiz-t-70-15 regions, respectively. The sequence of the AvrPiz-t-ZB15 region is 120966 bp whereas avrPiz-t-70-15 is 146292 bp in length. The extreme sequence similarity and good synteny in gene order and content along with the absence of two predicted genes in the avrPiz-t-70-15 region were observed in the predicted protein-coding regions in the AvrPiz-t locus. Nevertheless, frequent presence/absence and highly dynamic organization of transposable elements (TEs) were identified, representing the major variation of the AvrPiz-t locus between different isolates. Moreover, TEs constitute 27.3% and 43.2% of the genomic contents of the AvrPiz-t-ZB15 and avrPiz-t-70-15 regions, respectively, indicating that TEs contribute largely to the organization and evolution of AvrPiz-t locus. The findings of this study suggest that M. oryzae could benefit in an evolutionary sense from the presence of active TEs in genes conferring avirulence and provide an ability to rapidly change and thus to overcome host R genes.",plant utilize multiple layer defense mechanism fight invasion diverse pathogen r gene mediates resistance case dependent coexistence cognate pathogenderived avirulence avr gene rice blast r gene pizt corresponds geneforgene fashion magnaporthe oryzae avr gene avrpizt study determined compared genomic sequence surrounding avrpizt gene avirulent virulent isolates designating avrpiztzb avrpizt region respectively sequence avrpiztzb region bp whereas avrpizt bp length extreme sequence similarity good synteny gene order content along absence two predicted gene avrpizt region observed predicted proteincoding region avrpizt locus nevertheless frequent presenceabsence highly dynamic organization transposable element te identified representing major variation avrpizt locus different isolates moreover te constitute genomic content avrpiztzb avrpizt region respectively indicating te contribute largely organization evolution avrpizt locus finding study suggest oryzae could benefit evolutionary sense presence active te gene conferring avirulence provide ability rapidly change thus overcome host r gene,9,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
28029337,Harbouring public good mutants within a pathogen population can increase both fitness and virulence.,"Existing theory, empirical, clinical and field research all predict that reducing the virulence of individuals within a pathogen population will reduce the overall virulence, rendering disease less severe. Here, we show that this seemingly successful disease management strategy can fail with devastating consequences for infected hosts. We deploy cooperation theory and a novel synthetic system involving the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>. In vivo infections of rice demonstrate that <i>M. oryzae</i> virulence is enhanced, quite paradoxically, when a public good mutant is present in a population of high-virulence pathogens. We reason that during infection, the fungus engages in multiple cooperative acts to exploit host resources. We establish a multi-trait cooperation model which suggests that the observed failure of the virulence reduction strategy is caused by the interference between different social traits. Multi-trait cooperative interactions are widespread, so we caution against the indiscriminant application of anti-virulence therapy as a disease-management strategy.",existing theory empirical clinical field research predict reducing virulence individual within pathogen population reduce overall virulence rendering disease less severe show seemingly successful disease management strategy fail devastating consequence infected host deploy cooperation theory novel synthetic system involving rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei vivo infection rice demonstrate im oryzaei virulence enhanced quite paradoxically public good mutant present population highvirulence pathogen reason infection fungus engages multiple cooperative act exploit host resource establish multitrait cooperation model suggests observed failure virulence reduction strategy caused interference different social trait multitrait cooperative interaction widespread caution indiscriminant application antivirulence therapy diseasemanagement strategy,11,"{'Disease': ['overall virulence rendering disease', 'less severe show seemingly successful disease management strategy', 'rice blast fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei vivo infection rice', 'quite paradoxically public good mutant present population highvirulence pathogen reason infection fungus', 'different social trait multitrait cooperative interaction widespread caution indiscriminant application antivirulence therapy diseasemanagement strategy'], 'Treatment': ['less severe show seemingly successful disease management strategy', 'different social trait multitrait cooperative interaction widespread caution indiscriminant application antivirulence therapy diseasemanagement strategy'], 'Symptom': []}",9
32991996,"F-box only and CUE proteins are crucial ubiquitination-associated components for conidiation and pathogenicity in the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae.","Ubiquitination, an important process in post-translational modification, regulates various mechanisms in eukaryotes including protein degradation and interaction, cell cycle, stress response, and pathogenicity. The Skp1/Cullin/F-box and the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) complexes, RING E3 ligase complexes, are involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and protein quality control. The F-box protein has FBXO (F-box only or others), FBXW (with WD40), and FBXL (with LRR) classes depending on which interaction domain is present on the C-terminus. The ubiquitin system component cue (CUE) protein is a key factor of ERAD. However, the biological roles of FBXO and CUE proteins are largely unknown in plant pathogenic fungi including Magnaporthe oryzae. To elucidate the roles of FBXO and CUE proteins in fungal development and pathogenicity, MoFBX15 and MoCUE1 were functionally characterized in M. oryzae. Two ubiquitination-associated genes were crucial for conidiation, alkaline stress tolerance, and pathogenicity in M. oryzae. In particular, MoCUE1 was important for ER stress response and localization and translocation of cytoplasmic effectors. Moreover, ubiquitination and SUMOylation levels were decreased and transcript levels of deSUMOylation-associated genes were increased in ΔMofbx15 and ΔMocue1.

28755293,Genome re-sequencing analysis uncovers pathogenecity-related genes undergoing positive selection in Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is one of the most destructive diseases, which causes significant rice yield losses and affects global food security. To better understand genetic variations among different isolates of M. oryzae in nature, we re-sequenced the genomes of two field isolates, CH43 and Zhong-10-8-14, which showed distinct pathogenecity on most of the rice cultivars. Genome-wide genetic variation analysis reveals that ZHONG-10-8-14 exhibits higher sequence variations than CH43. Structural variations (SVs) detection shows that the sequence variations primarily occur in exons and intergenic regions. Bioinformatics analysis for gene variations reveals that many pathogenecity-related pathways are enriched. In addition, 193 candidate effectors with various DNA polymorphisms were identified, including two known effectors AVR-Pik and AVR-Pita1. Comparative polymorphism analysis of thirteen randomly selected effectors suggests that the genetic variations of effectors are under positive selection. The expression pattern analysis of several pathogenecity-related variant genes indicates that these genes are differentially regulated in two isolates, with much higher expression levels in Zhong-10-8-14 than CH43.

28666113,A Natural Allele of a Transcription Factor in Rice Confers Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance.,"Rice feeds half the world's population, and rice blast is often a destructive disease that results in significant crop loss. Non-race-specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race-specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability. Through a genome-wide association study, we report the identification of a natural allele of a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type transcription factor in rice that confers non-race-specific resistance to blast. A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10% of rice, suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding. This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> degradation and enhanced disease resistance. Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice.",rice feed half world population rice blast often destructive disease result significant crop loss nonracespecific resistance effective controlling crop disease racespecific resistance broad spectrum durability genomewide association study report identification natural allele csubsubhsubsubtype transcription factor rice confers nonracespecific resistance blast survey sequenced rice genome reveals allele exists rice suggesting favorable trait selected breeding allele cause single nucleotide change promoter bsrd gene result reduced expression gene binding repressive myb transcription factor consequently inhibition hsubsubosubsub degradation enhanced disease resistance discovery highlight novel allele strategy breeding durable resistance rice,2,"{'Disease': ['half world population rice blast often destructive disease'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10
26848538,Integration of decoy domains derived from protein targets of pathogen effectors into plant immune receptors is widespread.,"Plant immune receptors of the class of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain (NLR) proteins can contain additional domains besides canonical NB-ARC (nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, R proteins, and CED-4 (NB-ARC)) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Recent research suggests that these additional domains act as integrated decoys recognizing effectors from pathogens. Proteins homologous to integrated decoys are suspected to be effector targets and involved in disease or resistance. Here, we scrutinized 31 entire plant genomes to identify putative integrated decoy domains in NLR proteins using the Interpro search. The involvement of the Zinc Finger-BED type (ZBED) protein containing a putative decoy domain, called BED, in rice (Oryza sativa) resistance was investigated by evaluating susceptibility to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae in rice over-expression and knock-out mutants. This analysis showed that all plants tested had integrated various atypical protein domains into their NLR proteins (on average 3.5% of all NLR proteins). We also demonstrated that modifying the expression of the ZBED gene modified disease susceptibility. This study suggests that integration of decoy domains in NLR immune receptors is widespread and frequent in plants. The integrated decoy model is therefore a powerful concept to identify new proteins involved in disease resistance. Further in-depth examination of additional domains in NLR proteins promises to unravel many new proteins of the plant immune system.",plant immune receptor class nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat domain nlr protein contain additional domain besides canonical nbarc nucleotidebinding adaptor shared apaf r protein ced nbarc leucinerich repeat lrr domain recent research suggests additional domain act integrated decoy recognizing effector pathogen protein homologous integrated decoy suspected effector target involved disease resistance scrutinized entire plant genome identify putative integrated decoy domain nlr protein using interpro search involvement zinc fingerbed type zbed protein containing putative decoy domain called bed rice oryza sativa resistance investigated evaluating susceptibility blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae rice overexpression knockout mutant analysis showed plant tested integrated various atypical protein domain nlr protein average nlr protein also demonstrated modifying expression zbed gene modified disease susceptibility study suggests integration decoy domain nlr immune receptor widespread frequent plant integrated decoy model therefore powerful concept identify new protein involved disease resistance indepth examination additional domain nlr protein promise unravel many new protein plant immune system,1,"{'Disease': ['disease resistance', 'susceptibility blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae rice overexpression knockout mutant analysis', 'expression zbed gene modified disease susceptibility study', 'new protein involved disease resistance indepth examination additional domain nlr protein promise'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7

35332630,Multilocus sequence analysis and identification of mating-type idiomorphs distribution in Magnaporthe oryzae population of Karnataka state of India.,"To investigate the genetic diversity, population structure and mating-type distribution among the eco-distinct isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae from Karnataka, India. A set of 38 isolates of M. oryzae associated with leaf blast disease of rice were collected from different rice ecosystems of Karnataka, India, and analysed for their diversity at actin, β-tubulin, calmodulin, translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF-1-α), and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes/region. The isolates were grouped into two clusters based on the multilocus sequence diversity, the majority being in cluster-IA (n = 37), and only one isolate formed cluster-IB. Population structure was analysed using 123 SNP data to understand the genetic relationship. Based on K = 2 and ancestry threshold of >70%, blast strains were classified into two subgroups (SG1 and SG2) whereas, based on K = 4 and ancestry threshold of >70%, blast strains were classified into four subgroups (SG1, SG2, SG3 and SG4). We have identified 13 haplotype groups where haplotype group 2 was predominant (n = 20) in the population. The Tajima's and Fu's Fs neutrality tests exhibited many rare alleles. Further, the mating-type analysis was also performed using MAT1 gene-specific primers to find the potentiality of sexual reproduction in different ecosystems. The majority of the isolates (54.5%) had MAT1-2 idiomorph, whereas 45.5% of the isolates possessed MAT1-1 idiomorph. The present study found the genetically homogenous population of M. oryzae by multilocus sequence analysis. Both mating types, MAT1-1 and MAT1-2, were found within the M. oryzae population of Karnataka.

15856160,Genetic control of rice blast resistance in the durably resistant cultivar Gumei 2 against multiple isolates.,"To further our understanding of the genetic control of blast resistance in rice cultivar Gumei 2 and, consequently, to facilitate the utilization of this durably blast-resistant cultivar, we studied 304 recombinant inbred lines of indica rice cross Zhong 156/Gumei 2 and a linkage map comprising 181 markers. An analysis of segregation for resistance against five isolates of rice blast suggested that one gene cluster and three additional major genes that are independently inherited are responsible for the complete resistance of Gumei 2. The gene cluster was located to chromosome 6 and includes two genes mapped previously, Pi25(t), against Chinese rice blast isolate 92-183 (race ZC15) and Pi26(t) against Philippine rice blast isolate Ca89 (lineage 4), and a gene for resistance against Philippine rice blast isolate 92330-5 (lineage 17). Of the two genes conferring resistance against the Philippine isolates V86013 (lineage 15) and C923-39 (lineage 46), we identified one as Pi26(t) and mapped the other onto the distal end of chromosome 2 where Pib is located. We used three components of partial blast resistance, percentage diseased leaf area (DLA), lesion number and lesion size, all measured in the greenhouse, to measure the degree of susceptibility to isolates Ca89 and C923-39 and subsequently identified nine and eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs), respectively. Epistasis was determined to play an important role in partial resistance against Ca89. Using DLA measured on lines susceptible in a blast nursery, we detected six QTLs.

36440499,E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 destabilises the B-lectin receptor-like kinase PID2 to control blast disease resistance in rice.,"Previous studies have reported that PID2, which encodes a B-lectin receptor-like kinase, is a key gene in the resistance of rice to Magnaporthe oryzae strain ZB15. However, the PID2-mediated downstream signalling events remain largely unknown. The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase OsPIE3 (PID2-interacting E3) was isolated and confirmed to play key roles in PID2-mediated rice blast resistance. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that the armadillo repeat region of OsPIE3 is required for its interaction with PID2. Further investigation demonstrated that OsPIE3 can modify the subcellular localisation of PID2, thus promoting its nuclear recruitment from the plasma membrane for protein degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Site-directed mutagenesis of a conserved cysteine site (C230S) within the U-box domain of OsPIE3 reduces PID2 translocation and ubiquitination. Genetic analysis suggested that OsPIE3 loss-of-function mutants exhibited enhanced resistance to M. oryzae isolate ZB15, whereas mutants with overexpressed OsPIE3 exhibited reduced resistance. Furthermore, the OsPIE3/PID2-double mutant displayed a similar blast phenotype to that of the PID2 single mutant, suggesting that OsPIE3 is a negative regulator and functions along with PID2 in blast disease resistance.

28111288,OsCERK1-Mediated Chitin Perception and Immune Signaling Requires Receptor-like Cytoplasmic Kinase 185 to Activate an MAPK Cascade in Rice.,"Conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as chitin, are perceived by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) located at the host cell surface and trigger rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, which are required for plant resistance to pathogens. However, the direct links from PAMP perception to MAPK activation in plants remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that the PRR-associated receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase Oryza sativa RLCK185 transmits immune signaling from the PAMP receptor OsCERK1 to an MAPK signaling cascade through interaction with an MAPK kinase kinase, OsMAPKKKε, which is the initial kinase of the MAPK cascade. OsRLCK185 interacts with and phosphorylates the C-terminal regulatory domain of OsMAPKKKε. Coexpression of phosphomimetic OsRLCK185 and OsMAPKKKε activates MAPK3/6 phosphorylation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Moreover, OsMAPKKKε interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK4, a key MAPK kinase that transduces the chitin signal. Overexpression of OsMAPKKKε increases chitin-induced MAPK3/6 activation, whereas OsMAPKKKε knockdown compromises chitin-induced MAPK3/6 activation and resistance to rice blast fungus. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of a phospho-signaling pathway from cell surface chitin perception to intracellular activation of an MAPK cascade in rice.",conserved pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamps chitin perceived pattern recognition receptor prrs located host cell surface trigger rapid activation mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk cascade required plant resistance pathogen however direct link pamp perception mapk activation plant remain largely unknown study found prrassociated receptorlike cytoplasmic kinase oryza sativa rlck transmits immune signaling pamp receptor oscerk mapk signaling cascade interaction mapk kinase kinase osmapkkkε initial kinase mapk cascade osrlck interacts phosphorylates cterminal regulatory domain osmapkkkε coexpression phosphomimetic osrlck osmapkkkε activates mapk phosphorylation nicotiana benthamiana leaf moreover osmapkkkε interacts phosphorylates osmkk key mapk kinase transduces chitin signal overexpression osmapkkkε increase chitininduced mapk activation whereas osmapkkkε knockdown compromise chitininduced mapk activation resistance rice blast fungus taken together result suggest existence phosphosignaling pathway cell surface chitin perception intracellular activation mapk cascade rice,0,"{'Disease': ['mapk activation resistance rice blast fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",7
24237606,Inducible expression of a fusion gene encoding two proteinase inhibitors leads to insect and pathogen resistance in transgenic rice.,"Plant proteinase inhibitors (PIs) are considered as candidates for increased insect resistance in transgenic plants. Insect adaptation to PI ingestion might, however, compromise the benefits received by transgenic expression of PIs. In this study, the maize proteinase inhibitor (MPI), an inhibitor of insect serine proteinases, and the potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) were fused into a single open reading frame and introduced into rice plants. The two PIs were linked using either the processing site of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1B precursor protein or the 2A sequence from the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Expression of each fusion gene was driven by the wound- and pathogen-inducible mpi promoter. The mpi-pci fusion gene was stably inherited for at least three generations with no penalty on plant phenotype. An important reduction in larval weight of Chilo suppressalis fed on mpi-pci rice, compared with larvae fed on wild-type plants, was observed. Expression of the mpi-pci fusion gene confers resistance to C. suppressalis (striped stem borer), one of the most important insect pest of rice. The mpi-pci expression systems described may represent a suitable strategy for insect pest control, better than strategies based on the use of single PI genes, by preventing insect adaptive responses. The rice plants expressing the mpi-pci fusion gene also showed enhanced resistance to infection by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of the rice blast disease. Our results illustrate the usefulness of the inducible expression of the mpi-pci fusion gene for dual resistance against insects and pathogens in rice plants.",plant proteinase inhibitor pi considered candidate increased insect resistance transgenic plant insect adaptation pi ingestion might however compromise benefit received transgenic expression pi study maize proteinase inhibitor mpi inhibitor insect serine proteinase potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor pci fused single open reading frame introduced rice plant two pi linked using either processing site bacillus thuringiensis cryb precursor protein sequence footandmouth disease virus fmdv expression fusion gene driven wound pathogeninducible mpi promoter mpipci fusion gene stably inherited least three generation penalty plant phenotype important reduction larval weight chilo suppressalis fed mpipci rice compared larva fed wildtype plant observed expression mpipci fusion gene confers resistance c suppressalis striped stem borer one important insect pest rice mpipci expression system described may represent suitable strategy insect pest control better strategy based use single pi gene preventing insect adaptive response rice plant expressing mpipci fusion gene also showed enhanced resistance infection fungus magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease result illustrate usefulness inducible expression mpipci fusion gene dual resistance insect pathogen rice plant,10,"{'Disease': ['footandmouth disease virus fmdv expression fusion gene', 'enhanced resistance infection fungus magnaporthe oryzae causal agent rice blast disease result illustrate usefulness inducible expression mpipci fusion gene dual resistance insect pathogen rice plant'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",5
36943290,Calcium-binding protein OsANN1 regulates rice blast disease resistance by inactivating jasmonic acid signaling.,"Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Plant annexins are calcium- and lipid-binding proteins that have multiple functions; however, the biological roles of annexins in plant disease resistance remain unknown. Here, we report a rice annexin gene, OsANN1 (Rice annexin 1), that was induced by M. oryzae infection and negatively regulated blast disease resistance in rice. By yeast 2-hybrid screening, we found that OsANN1 interacted with a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, HAN1 (""HAN"" termed ""chilling"" in Chinese), which has been reported to catalyze the conversion of biologically active jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) to the inactive form 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile. Pathogen inoculation assays revealed that HAN1 was also a negative regulator in rice blast resistance. Genetic evidence showed that OsANN1 acts upstream of HAN1. OsANN1 stabilizes HAN1 in planta, resulting in the inactivation of the endogenous biologically active JA-Ile. Taken together, our study unravels a mechanism where an OsANN1-HAN1 module impairs blast disease resistance via inactivating biologically active JA-Ile and JA signaling in rice.",rice blast caused fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae one devastating disease rice oryza sativa l plant annexins calcium lipidbinding protein multiple function however biological role annexins plant disease resistance remain unknown report rice annexin gene osann rice annexin induced oryzae infection negatively regulated blast disease resistance rice yeast hybrid screening found osann interacted cytochrome p monooxygenase han han termed chilling chinese reported catalyze conversion biologically active jasmonoyllisoleucine jaile inactive form hydroxyjaile pathogen inoculation assay revealed han also negative regulator rice blast resistance genetic evidence showed osann act upstream han osann stabilizes han planta resulting inactivation endogenous biologically active jaile taken together study unravels mechanism osannhan module impairs blast disease resistance via inactivating biologically active jaile ja signaling rice,4,"{'Disease': ['one devastating disease rice oryza sativa l plant', 'plant disease resistance', 'negatively regulated blast disease resistance rice yeast hybrid screening'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",10

Mushk Budji is a commercially important speciality rice known for its taste and aroma, nonetheless, is extremely vulnerable to blast disease. Through the use of the marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) approach, a set of 24 Near-isogenic lines (NILs) was created, and the lines with the highest background genome recovery were chosen. The expression analysis was carried out for the component genes and other eight pathway genes related to blast resistance. The major blast resistance genes Pi9 (from IRBL-9W) and Pi54 (from DHMAS 70Q 164-1b) were incorporated following simultaneous-but-step-wise MABC. The NILs harbouring genes Pi9 + Pi54, Pi9 and Pi54 expressed resistance to isolate (Mo-nwi-kash-32) under controlled and natural field conditions.

27620492,CONSTANS-like 9 (COL9) delays the flowering time in Oryza sativa by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.,"Flowering or heading is one of most important agronomic traits in rice. It has been characterized that CONSTANS (CO) and CONSTANS-like (COL) proteins are critical flowering regulators in response to photoperiodic stress in plants. We have previously identified that the COL family member OsCOL9 can positively enhance the rice blast resistance. In the present study, we aimed to explore the functional role of OsCOL9 in modulating the photoperiodic flowering. Our data showed that overexpression of OsCOL9 delayed the flowering time under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions, leading to suppressed expressions of EHd1, RFT and Hd3a at the mRNA Level. OsCOL9 expression exhibited two types of circadian patterns under different daylight conditions, and it could delay the heading date by suppressing the Ehd1 photoperiodic flowering pathway. In contrast, the expressions of previously reported flowering regulators were not significantly changed in OsCOL9 transgenic plants, indicating that OsCOL9 functioned independently of other flowering pathways. In addition, OsCOL9 served as a potential yield gene, and its deficiency reduced the grain number of main panicle in plants. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that OsCOL9 physically interacted with Receptor for Activated C-kinase 1 (OsRACK1). Rhythmic pattern analysis suggested that OsRACK1 responded to the change of daylight, which was regulated by the circadian clock. Taken together, our results revealed that OsCOL9 could delay the flowering time in rice by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.",flowering heading one important agronomic trait rice characterized constans co constanslike col protein critical flowering regulator response photoperiodic stress plant previously identified col family member oscol positively enhance rice blast resistance present study aimed explore functional role oscol modulating photoperiodic flowering data showed overexpression oscol delayed flowering time shortday sd longday ld condition leading suppressed expression ehd rft hda mrna level oscol expression exhibited two type circadian pattern different daylight condition could delay heading date suppressing ehd photoperiodic flowering pathway contrast expression previously reported flowering regulator significantly changed oscol transgenic plant indicating oscol functioned independently flowering pathway addition oscol served potential yield gene deficiency reduced grain number main panicle plant furthermore yeast twohybrid assay indicated oscol physically interacted receptor activated ckinase osrack rhythmic pattern analysis suggested osrack responded change daylight regulated circadian clock taken together result revealed oscol could delay flowering time rice repressing ehd pathway,8,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",13

Spatial-temporal expression pattern analysis revealed that four of the <i>OsCRFs</i> were barely expressed in all tested samples, while the other five were highly expressed in the leaf, panicle, or seed of rice. Microarray data showed that <i>OsCRF</i> genes are regulated to varying degrees by abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin, and jasmonic acid. Furthermore, through analyzing the RNA-seq data, we found that <i>OsCRFs</i> are primarily involved in plant response to temperature stress (chilling and heat), with several <i>OsCRFs</i> also implicated in drought response, while hardly any respond to salt stress.

37958524,Insertion of Transposable Elements in <i>AVR-Pib</i> of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Leading to LOSS of the Avirulent Function.,"Rice blast is a very serious disease caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, which threatens rice production and food supply throughout the world. The avirulence (<i>AVR</i>) genes of rice blast are perceived by the corresponding rice blast resistance (<i>R</i>) genes and prompt specific resistance. A mutation in <i>AVR</i> is a major force for new virulence. Exploring mutations in <i>AVR</i> among <i>M. oryzae</i> isolates from rice production fields could aid assessment of the efficacy and durability of <i>R</i> genes. We studied the probable molecular-evolutionary patterns of <i>AVR-Pib</i> alleles by assaying their DNA-sequence diversification and examining their avirulence to the corresponding <i>Pib</i> resistance gene under natural conditions in the extremely genetically diverse of rice resources of Yunnan, China. PCRs detected results from <i>M. oryzae</i> genomic DNA and revealed that 162 out of 366 isolates collected from Yunnan Province contained <i>AVR-Pib</i> alleles. Among them, 36.1-73.3% isolates from six different rice production areas of Yunnan contained <i>AVR-Pib</i> alleles. Furthermore, 36 (28.6%) out of 126 isolates had a transposable element (TE) insertion in <i>AVR-Pib</i>, which resulted in altered virulence. The TE insertion was identified in isolates from rice rather than from <i>Musa nana</i> Lour. Twelve <i>AVR-Pib</i> haplotypes encoding three novel <i>AVR-Pib</i> variants were identified among the remaining 90 isolates. <i>AVR-Pib</i> alleles evolved to virulent forms from avirulent forms by base substitution and TE insertion of Pot2 and Pot3 in the 5' untranslated region of <i>AVR-Pib</i>.

36913579,Rgs1 is a regulator of effector gene expression during plant infection by the rice blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>.,"To cause rice blast disease, the filamentous fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> secretes a battery of effector proteins into host plant tissue to facilitate infection. Effector-encoding genes are expressed only during plant infection and show very low expression during other developmental stages. How effector gene expression is regulated in such a precise manner during invasive growth by <i>M. oryzae</i> is not known. Here, we report a forward-genetic screen to identify regulators of effector gene expression, based on the selection of mutants that show constitutive effector gene expression. Using this simple screen, we identify Rgs1, a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein that is necessary for appressorium development, as a novel transcriptional regulator of effector gene expression, which acts prior to plant infection. We show that an N-terminal domain of Rgs1, possessing transactivation activity, is required for effector gene regulation and acts in an RGS-independent manner. Rgs1 controls the expression of at least 60 temporally coregulated effector genes, preventing their transcription during the prepenetration stage of development prior to plant infection. A regulator of appressorium morphogenesis is therefore also required for the orchestration of pathogen gene expression required for invasive growth by <i>M. oryzae</i> during plant infection.",cause rice blast disease filamentous fungus imagnaporthe oryzaei secretes battery effector protein host plant tissue facilitate infection effectorencoding gene expressed plant infection show low expression developmental stage effector gene expression regulated precise manner invasive growth im oryzaei known report forwardgenetic screen identify regulator effector gene expression based selection mutant show constitutive effector gene expression using simple screen identify rg regulator gprotein signaling rg protein necessary appressorium development novel transcriptional regulator effector gene expression act prior plant infection show nterminal domain rg possessing transactivation activity required effector gene regulation act rgsindependent manner rg control expression least temporally coregulated effector gene preventing transcription prepenetration stage development prior plant infection regulator appressorium morphogenesis therefore also required orchestration pathogen gene expression required invasive growth im oryzaei plant infection,3,"{'Disease': ['filamentous fungus'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['low expression developmental stage effector gene expression', 'regulator effector gene expression', 'constitutive effector gene expression', 'rg protein necessary appressorium development novel transcriptional regulator effector gene expression', 'least temporally coregulated effector gene']}",9

Real time expression analysis of the transgenes (ZmPsy and CrtI) driven by endosperm-specific promoter revealed the leaky expression of the transgene in the vegetative tissues. We propose that the disruption of OsAux1 disturbed the fine balance of plant growth regulators viz., auxins, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid, leading to the abnormalities in the growth and development of the lines homozygous for the transgene.

22900499,Heterogeneous evolutionary rates of Pi2/9 homologs in rice.,"The Pi2/9 locus contains multiple nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes in the rice genome. Although three functional R-genes have been cloned from this locus, little is known about the origin and evolutionary history of these genes. Herein, an extensive genome-wide survey of Pi2/9 homologs in rice, sorghum, Brachypodium and Arabidopsis, was conducted to explore this theme. In our study, 1, 1, 5 and 156 Pi2/9 homologs were detected in Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, sorghum and rice genomes, respectively. Two distinct evolutionary patterns of Pi2/9 homologs, Type I and Type II, were observed in rice lines. Type I Pi2/9 homologs showed evidence of rapid gene diversification, including substantial copy number variations, obscured orthologous relationships, high levels of nucleotide diversity or/and divergence, frequent sequence exchanges and strong positive selection, whereas Type II Pi2/9 homologs exhibited a fairly slow evolutionary rate. Interestingly, the three cloned R-genes from the Pi2/9 locus all belonged to the Type I genes. Our data show that the Pi2/9 locus had an ancient origin predating the common ancestor of gramineous species. The existence of two types of Pi2/9 homologs suggest that diversifying evolution should be an important strategy of rice to cope with different types of pathogens. The relationship of cloned Pi2/9 genes and Type I genes also suggests that rapid gene diversification might facilitate rice to adapt quickly to the changing spectrum of the fungal pathogen M. grisea.

Overexpression of OsWRKY13 can enhance rice resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast, two of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, at both the seedling and adult stages, and shows no influence on the fertility.

We found that pre-infestation of rice by C. suppressalis or N. lugens but not by C. medinalis conferred resistance to M. oryzae. For C. suppressalis and N. lugens, insect infestation without fungal inoculation induced the accumulation of both JA and SA in rice leaves. In contrast, infestation by C. medinalis increased JA levels but reduced SA levels. The exogenous application of SA but not of JA conferred resistance against M. oryzae. These results suggest that pre-infestation by C. suppressalis or N. lugens conferred resistance against M. oryzae by increasing SA accumulation. These findings enhance our understanding of the interactions among rice plant, insects and pathogens, and provide valuable information for developing an ecologically sound strategy for controlling rice blast.",agroecosystems plant important mediator interaction associated herbivorous insect microbe change plant induced one specie may lead cascading effect interaction specie often effect regulated phytohormone jasmonic acid ja salicylic acid sa investigated tripartite interaction among rice plant three insect herbivore chilo suppressalis cnaphalocrocis medinalis nilaparvata lugens causal agent rice blast disease fungus magnaporthe oryzae found preinfestation rice c suppressalis n lugens c medinalis conferred resistance oryzae c suppressalis n lugens insect infestation without fungal inoculation induced accumulation ja sa rice leaf contrast infestation c medinalis increased ja level reduced sa level exogenous application sa ja conferred resistance oryzae result suggest preinfestation c suppressalis n lugens conferred resistance oryzae increasing sa accumulation finding enhance understanding interaction among rice plant insect pathogen provide valuable information developing ecologically sound strategy controlling rice blast,4,"{'Disease': ['nilaparvata lugens causal agent rice blast disease fungus magnaporthe oryzae'], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': ['effect interaction specie']}",8
15341648,Independent genetic mechanisms mediate turgor generation and penetration peg formation during plant infection in the rice blast fungus.,"The first barrier to infection encountered by foliar pathogens is the host cuticle. To traverse this obstacle, many fungi produce specialized infection cells called appressoria. MST12 is essential for appressorium-mediated penetration and infectious growth by the rice pathogen Magnaporthe grisea. In this study, we have characterized in detail the penetration defects of an mst12 deletion mutant. Appressoria formed by the mst12 mutant developed normal turgor pressure and ultrastructure but failed to form penetration pegs either on cellophane membranes or on plant epidermal cells. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis analyses indicated that both the homeodomain and zinc finger domains, but not the middle region, of MST12 are essential for appressorial penetration and plant infection. The mst12 mutant appeared to be defective in microtubule reorganization associated with penetration peg formation. In mature appressoria, the mutant lacked vertical microtubules observed in the wild type. The mst12 mutant also failed to elicit localized host defence responses, including papilla formation and autofluorescence. Our data indicate that generation of appressorium turgor pressure and formation of the penetration peg are two independent processes. MST12 may play important roles in regulating penetration peg formation and directing the physical forces exerted by the appressorium turgor in mature appressoria.",first barrier infection encountered foliar pathogen host cuticle traverse obstacle many fungi produce specialized infection cell called appressoria mst essential appressoriummediated penetration infectious growth rice pathogen magnaporthe grisea study characterized detail penetration defect mst deletion mutant appressoria formed mst mutant developed normal turgor pressure ultrastructure failed form penetration peg either cellophane membrane plant epidermal cell deletion sitedirected mutagenesis analysis indicated homeodomain zinc finger domain middle region mst essential appressorial penetration plant infection mst mutant appeared defective microtubule reorganization associated penetration peg formation mature appressoria mutant lacked vertical microtubule observed wild type mst mutant also failed elicit localized host defence response including papilla formation autofluorescence data indicate generation appressorium turgor pressure formation penetration peg two independent process mst may play important role regulating penetration peg formation directing physical force exerted appressorium turgor mature appressoria,3,"{'Disease': [], 'Treatment': [], 'Symptom': []}",9

Here, we present protocols for (1) comparative analysis of sRNAs in different conditions, (2) comparisons of sRNA libraries to RNAseq data and (3) identification and analysis of methylguanosine-capped and polyadenylated sRNAs (CPA-sRNAs). This species of small RNA is particularly interesting in Magnaporthe oryzae, as they map to transcription start and end sites of protein-coding genes. While we do not provide specific command lines for scripts, we provide a general framework for steps needed to carry out all three types of analyses, including relevant references, websites and free online tools.

31836057,Antifungal activity of endophytic Bacillus safensis B21 and its potential application as a biopesticide to control rice blast.,"Endophytic bacteria are potential biocontrol agents for the control of fungal diseases. Here, an endophyte strain, B21, was isolated from Osmanthus fragrans Lour. fruits and identified as Bacillus safensis by analysis of its 16S rDNA gene sequence and its biochemical and physiological characteristics. The culture filtrate showed antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae, which causes rice blast disease, and the IC<sub>50</sub> of the methanol extract was 15.56 μg/mL, which was significantly lower than that of carbendazim (25.16 μg/mL). The antifungal activity of the methanol extract was stable at a wide range of pH values (1-9) and temperatures (40-100 °C). Two antifungal compounds were isolated by organic extraction, silica gel column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) analyses, the structures of the antifungal compounds were identified as iturin A2 and iturin A6. Additionally, the hyphae treated with iturin (iturin A2 or iturin A6) could be stained with the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI), indicating that these two compounds inhibited the growth of hyphae by changing the hyphal membrane permeability. In field experiments, spray treatment with fermentation broth resulted in a lower disease index than treatment with carbendazim, as did the culture filtrate. The results suggest that strain B21 and its bioactive compounds have the potential to be developed into a biopesticide for the biocontrol of rice blast.",endophytic bacteria potential biocontrol agent control fungal disease endophyte strain b isolated osmanthus fragrans lour fruit identified bacillus safensis analysis rdna gene sequence biochemical physiological characteristic culture filtrate showed antifungal activity magnaporthe oryzae cause rice blast disease icsubsub methanol extract μgml significantly lower carbendazim μgml antifungal activity methanol extract stable wide range ph value temperature °c two antifungal compound isolated organic extraction silica gel column chromatography highperformance liquid chromatography hplc based electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esims nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry nmr analysis structure antifungal compound identified iturin iturin additionally hypha treated iturin iturin iturin could stained fluorescent dye propidium iodide pi indicating two compound inhibited growth hypha changing hyphal membrane permeability field experiment spray treatment fermentation broth resulted lower disease index treatment carbendazim culture filtrate result suggest strain b bioactive compound potential developed biopesticide biocontrol rice blast,8,"{'Disease': ['potential biocontrol agent control fungal disease endophyte strain', 'rice blast disease icsubsub methanol', 'lower disease index treatment carbendazim culture filtrate result'], 'Treatment': ['changing hyphal membrane permeability field experiment spray treatment fermentation broth', 'lower disease index treatment carbendazim culture filtrate result'], 'Symptom': []}",11
16630016,Detection of Magnaporthe grisea in infested rice seeds using polymerase chain reaction.,"To develop a diagnostic assay based on polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Magnaporthe grisea from infested rice seeds. Primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the mif 23, an infection-specific gene of M. grisea. The primers amplified target DNA from genetically and geographically diverse isolates of the pathogen. The lowest concentration of template DNA that led to amplification was 20 rhog. No PCR product was detected when DNA from other fungi was used, indicating the specificity of the primers. With this PCR based seed assay, M. grisea was detected in rice seedlots with infestation rates as low as 0.2%. The PCR detection of M. grisea is simple, rapid, specific, sensitive and suitable for the routine detection of the pathogen in infested seeds. Introduction of the blast fungus into new areas where it has not been previously recorded could be avoided by the detection of infested seedlots. A PCR-based seed assay could facilitate risk assessment of naturally infested rice seeds; help design management programs and optimize fungicide use.",develop diagnostic assay based polymerase chain reaction detection magnaporthe grisea infested rice seed primer designed based nucleotide sequence mif infectionspecific gene grisea primer amplified target dna genetically geographically diverse isolates pathogen lowest concentration template dna led amplification rhog pcr product detected dna fungi used indicating specificity primer pcr based seed assay grisea detected rice seedlots infestation rate low pcr detection grisea simple rapid specific sensitive suitable routine detection pathogen infested seed introduction blast fungus new area previously recorded could avoided detection infested seedlots pcrbased seed assay could facilitate risk assessment naturally infested rice seed help design management program optimize fungicide use,8,"{'Disease': ['seed introduction blast fungus new area'], 'Treatment': ['management program'], 'Symptom': []}",2
31836058,In vitro fungicidal activity and in planta control efficacy of coumoxystrobin against Magnaporthe oryzae.,"Rice blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is a destructive fungal disease in rice, causing serious losses in yield and quality. Coumoxystrobin is a novel methoxyacrylate strobilurin fungicide. In the current study, we determined the sensitivity of 100 M. oryzae strains to coumoxystrobin based on the mycelial growth inhibition method. The EC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 0.0089 to 0.0290 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, with a mean EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.0163 ± 0.0036 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, indicating that coumoxystrobin exhibits an excellent inhibitory activity in the mycelial growth of M. oryzae. In addition, the EC<sub>50</sub> values had no significant difference among four populations from the different geographical regions. After treating with coumoxystrobin, cell membrane permeability increased, respiration decreased, and the hyphal tips were contorted, with offshoot of top increasing. Protective and curative activity tests showed that coumoxystrobin exhibited better protective and curative activities against M. oryzae in detached barley leaves in comparison to the currently used fungicides tricyclazole and azoxystrobin. Also, it was found that the protective activity was better than its curative activity. Furthermore, compared with the currently used fungicides, coumoxystrobin not only exhibited excellent control efficacy on rice blast, but also markedly reduced the dosages of chemical fungicides in the field trials. Overall, these findings provide important references for revealing the pharmacological effect of coumoxystrobin against M. oryzae and managing rice blast caused by M. oryzae.",rice blast caused magnaporthe oryzae destructive fungal disease rice causing serious loss yield quality coumoxystrobin novel methoxyacrylate strobilurin fungicide current study determined sensitivity oryzae strain coumoxystrobin based mycelial growth inhibition method ecsubsub value ranged μg mlsupsup mean ecsubsub value ± μg mlsupsup indicating coumoxystrobin exhibit excellent inhibitory activity mycelial growth oryzae addition ecsubsub value significant difference among four population different geographical region treating coumoxystrobin cell membrane permeability increased respiration decreased hyphal tip contorted offshoot top increasing protective curative activity test showed coumoxystrobin exhibited better protective curative activity oryzae detached barley leaf comparison currently used fungicide tricyclazole azoxystrobin also found protective activity better curative activity furthermore compared currently used fungicide coumoxystrobin exhibited excellent control efficacy rice blast also markedly reduced dosage chemical fungicide field trial overall finding provide important reference revealing pharmacological effect coumoxystrobin oryzae managing rice blast caused oryzae,8,"{'Disease': ['magnaporthe oryzae destructive fungal disease rice'], 'Treatment': ['coumoxystrobin based mycelial growth inhibition method ecsubsub value'], 'Symptom': ['important reference revealing pharmacological effect coumoxystrobin oryzae']}",11
